Okay, let's talk about Scotland's patron saint, St. Andrew. Patron saints are special protectors or guides of a particular place or group. St. Andrew has been linked to Scotland for a very long time, with some stories saying his relics were brought there in the 4th century. He was one of Jesus's twelve apostles and is said to have been crucified on an X-shaped cross, which is why you see that diagonal cross on the Scottish flag, the Saltire. This symbol has been used to represent Scotland since the 13th century. So, while St. David is the patron saint of Wales, St. George of England, and St. Patrick of Ireland, it's St. Andrew who holds that special place in Scottish history and identity. Think of it this way: Scotland and Andrew both have an "an" sound in them.
