The Tower of London has a long and fascinating history, originally built by William the Conqueror after 1066 as a fortress to control the city. Over the centuries, it's served many purposes: a royal palace, a prison, and even a zoo! But most famously, it's been the secure home of the Crown Jewels since the 17th century. These aren't just any jewels; they are priceless symbols of the British monarchy, including crowns, orbs, and sceptres used in coronation ceremonies. Because of their immense value and historical significance, they need to be kept under very tight security. The Tower, with its thick walls, Beefeater guards, and long history of protecting important figures and items, provides that security. So, while you might visit Loch Lomond for its beautiful scenery, admire Big Ben's clock face, or explore Edinburgh Castle's Scottish history, it's the Tower of London you need to head to if you want to see the dazzling Crown Jewels.
