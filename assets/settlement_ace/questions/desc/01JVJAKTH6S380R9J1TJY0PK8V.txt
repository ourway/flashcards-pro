Okay, let's break down why Henry Tudor became King Henry VII. To understand this, we need to go back to the Wars of the Roses, a long and bloody struggle for the English throne between the House of Lancaster and the House of York. Think of it like a real-life Game of Thrones! The Lancastrians were represented by a red rose, and the Yorkists by a white rose. This conflict had been raging for decades, weakening England. Henry Tudor, representing the House of Lancaster, defeated King Richard III of the House of York at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. This battle is super important because it effectively ended the Wars of the Roses. By right of conquest, and through some clever maneuvering to unite the warring houses, Henry Tudor then claimed the throne. He married Elizabeth of York, symbolically merging the two houses and bringing much-needed stability to the country. That's why Henry Tudor became King Henry VII â€“ he ended a long civil war and established a new dynasty, the Tudors, who would rule England for over a century.
