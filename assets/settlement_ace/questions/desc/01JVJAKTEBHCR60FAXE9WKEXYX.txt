The House of Lords, one of the two houses of Parliament, is made up of Lords Spiritual (senior bishops of the Church of England) and Lords Temporal. The Lords Temporal include hereditary peers, who inherit their titles, and life peers. Life peers are appointed to the House of Lords for their lifetime, and this is a key distinction. They're appointed based on their individual merit and contributions to national life, often for achievements in fields like business, science, arts, or public service. The Prime Minister nominates individuals to become life peers, and their names are then submitted to the King for approval. Once appointed, they serve for the rest of their lives, participating in the legislative process, scrutinizing government actions, and offering their expertise on various issues. So, the statement is true because these peers, nominated by the Prime Minister and approved by the King, are indeed appointed to serve for life, bringing valuable experience and knowledge to the House of Lords.
