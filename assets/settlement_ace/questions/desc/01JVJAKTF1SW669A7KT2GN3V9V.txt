The Glorious Revolution of 1688 is a fascinating period in British history because, unlike many revolutions, it involved very little bloodshed on English soil. Think of the English Civil War earlier in the century â€“ that was full of battles and conflict! By the late 1680s, there was growing concern about the Catholic King James II and his policies. Leading English nobles invited William of Orange, the Protestant ruler of the Netherlands and James's son-in-law, to take the throne. William landed in England with an army, but James's support crumbled, and he fled to France. Because William and Mary were then able to take the throne with minimal violence and a new constitutional settlement was agreed upon, limiting the power of the monarchy and guaranteeing certain rights, it became known as the "Glorious Revolution." It wasn't about technological advancements, new achievements in general, or women's suffrage (that came much later!). The "glory" refers to the peaceful, relatively bloodless nature of the change in leadership.
