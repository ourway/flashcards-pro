The Tudor dynasty is a really important period in British history, marking the end of the medieval era and the beginning of early modern Britain. Before the Tudors, England was embroiled in the Wars of the Roses, a bloody conflict between the House of Lancaster and the House of York for the throne. Think of it like a real-life Game of Thrones! This war weakened both houses. Henry Tudor, who became Henry VII, cleverly ended the Wars of the Roses by defeating Richard III of the House of York at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. By marrying Elizabeth of York, he united the two houses and established the Tudor dynasty. So, while the Houses of Lancaster and York were key players in the lead-up to the Tudor period, it was Henry Tudor, later Henry VII, who actually founded the Tudor dynasty and became its first king. He was the one who started this new chapter in English history.
