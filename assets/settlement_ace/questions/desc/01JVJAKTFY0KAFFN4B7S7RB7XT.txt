Sir Edwin Lutyens was one of the most influential British architects of the 20th century, renowned for his grand and classical style. He was born in 1869 and died in 1944. His most famous work is arguably his design for much of New Delhi, the capital of India, including the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Palace). Back in Britain, he designed many country houses, war memorials, and public buildings. A great example of his work is the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London, a simple yet powerful war memorial that has become a national symbol of remembrance. So, while the other options might sound plausible, perhaps referencing a famous sporting event, a political leader, or a technological innovator, they have nothing to do with Lutyens. He left his mark on the world through bricks and mortar, not politics, sports, or technology.
