Henry VIII's reign in the 16th century was a pivotal moment in English history, largely because of his break with the Roman Catholic Church. Before Henry, England was firmly under the authority of the Pope in Rome. However, Henry wanted to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, in order to marry Anne Boleyn and hopefully produce a male heir. The Pope refused to grant him an annulment, leading to a major conflict. In response, Henry declared himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England, effectively severing ties with Rome. This act, formalized through a series of Acts of Parliament between 1533 and 1536, is known as the English Reformation. This allowed him to get his divorce and remarry, but more importantly, it established the Church of England as an independent entity, separate from papal authority. This was a massive power shift, giving the English monarch control over religious matters and paving the way for future religious changes in England. So, while Henry didn't establish the RAF (that was much later, in the 20th century), invade Sweden (he was focused on domestic issues and European alliances closer to home), or re-establish the Catholic Church (quite the opposite!), his break with Rome is his most significant and lasting contribution to English history.
