Okay, let's talk about the Wars of the Roses. This was a series of civil wars fought in England from 1455 to 1487 between the House of Lancaster and the House of York, both branches of the royal Plantagenet family. Now, each house had a symbolic rose. The House of York was represented by a white rose. Think of York as pristine and white! On the other hand, the House of Lancaster adopted the red rose as their emblem. The red rose is a powerful symbol, often associated with passion and strength, fitting for a family fighting for the throne. The wars eventually ended when Henry Tudor, who was from the Lancastrian side, defeated Richard III of York and became King Henry VII. He then married Elizabeth of York, uniting the two houses and creating the Tudor dynasty. To symbolize this union, the Tudor rose was created, combining the red and white roses. So, when you think of Lancaster in the Wars of the Roses, remember their fierce fight for the crown and their bold red rose.
