Okay, let's break down the difference between Scottish and English common law. It's easy to get them mixed up! While both legal systems share some history, a key distinction lies in whether their common law is 'unwritten'. In England, common law developed over centuries through court decisions and customs, not through formal written codes. Think of it as a body of legal principles built case by case. Scotland, however, has a more codified system. Although it also has a common law tradition, much of it has been written down and formalized over time. This means that Scottish common law is not considered 'unwritten' in the same way as English common law. It's a subtle but important difference. So, the statement that common law in Scotland is 'unwritten' is false because, unlike England, Scotland's legal system has been significantly codified. This codification is a defining characteristic of the Scottish legal system, setting it apart from its English counterpart.
