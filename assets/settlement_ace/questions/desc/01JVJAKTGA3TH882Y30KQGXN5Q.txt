The 18th and 19th centuries witnessed a period of unprecedented change, driven by new technologies and manufacturing processes. Think about it: before this time, most goods were made by hand, often in people's homes or small workshops. Then, innovations like the steam engine, the power loom, and the cotton gin came along, completely changing how things were produced. These inventions led to the rise of factories, mass production, and urbanization, as people moved from rural areas to cities in search of work. This period of massive change is known as the Industrial Revolution. It wasn't just about new machines; it was a fundamental shift in society, economics, and even culture. So, when you hear about a period that drastically transformed industry in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Industrial Revolution is the key event to remember.
