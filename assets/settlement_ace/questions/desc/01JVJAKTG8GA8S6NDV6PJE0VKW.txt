The small claims track is designed to be a simpler, more informal way to resolve disputes in the civil courts without needing a lawyer. It's all about making justice accessible for everyday people dealing with smaller amounts of money. Now, the key thing to remember is the threshold for using this small claims track. While £3,000 might sound like a reasonable limit, the actual limit in England and Wales is higher. Currently, you can use the small claims track for claims up to £10,000, not £3,000, for most types of claims. The £10,000 limit was introduced to allow more people to resolve disputes without incurring significant legal costs. So, if you thought the limit was £3,000, you're underestimating how far the small claims track actually extends.
