Stratford-upon-Avon is the birthplace of William Shakespeare, one of the most celebrated writers in the English language. He was born there in 1564 and spent much of his life in the town. This market town in Warwickshire, England, is synonymous with Shakespeare's life and works. You can still visit his birthplace, a preserved Tudor house, and other locations associated with him, like his schoolroom and the church where he was baptised and buried. While Shakespeare did spend a significant portion of his career in London, where his plays were performed at the Globe Theatre, he always maintained strong ties to Stratford-upon-Avon. He eventually retired there and died in 1616. So, while London was crucial to his professional success, Stratford-upon-Avon is where his story began, making it the correct answer. The other locations, Berkshire and Essex, have no significant connection to Shakespeare's life.
