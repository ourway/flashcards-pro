The Jutes were one of the Germanic tribes who migrated to Britain after the Roman Empire withdrew in the 5th century AD. To understand where they came from, it's helpful to picture the map of Europe at that time. The Jutes, unlike groups from warmer Mediterranean regions, originated from Northern Europe, specifically the area now encompassing Denmark and parts of northern Germany. This region was home to various Germanic tribes who, driven by factors like overpopulation and the lure of new lands, began migrating westward. The Angles and Saxons, who also settled in Britain, came from similar areas. So, when you think of the Jutes, picture them setting sail from the cold, coastal regions of Northern Europe to make their mark on British history. The other options are incorrect because they represent regions that were not the origin points for these particular Germanic tribes during the migration period.
