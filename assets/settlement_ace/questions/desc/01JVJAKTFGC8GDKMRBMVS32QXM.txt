The Iron Age in Britain, lasting roughly from 800 BC to the Roman invasion in 43 AD, was a time of significant societal and technological development. Ironworking skills, which had spread from Europe, allowed for stronger tools and weapons. This era also saw the rise of more complex social structures, with tribal kingdoms becoming increasingly common. Before the Iron Age, trade relied on bartering or using precious metals by weight. The introduction of coinage during this period represents a major step towards a more sophisticated economy. These early coins, often made of bronze, silver, or gold, weren't just for trade; they were also a symbol of power and authority. Stamping the names of Iron Age kings onto these coins was a way for rulers to assert their control and project their image across their territories. While earlier periods like the Stone Age and Bronze Age saw advancements in toolmaking and metalworking respectively, they predate the complex social structures and technological capabilities necessary for minting coins with personalized markings.
