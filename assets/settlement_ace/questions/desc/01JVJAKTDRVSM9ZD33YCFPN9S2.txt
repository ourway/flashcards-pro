The annual boat race between Oxford and Cambridge Universities is a quintessential British tradition, steeped in history and rivalry. It's a rowing race, not sailing or swimming, and has been held almost every year since 1829. Think of it as a classic head-to-head challenge of strength, endurance, and teamwork. The race takes place on a specific stretch of the River Thames in West London, a 4.2-mile course known as the Championship Course. While sailing is popular in the UK, it's not the focus of this particular inter-university rivalry. And while some brave souls might swim in the Thames, a competitive race of that distance would be quite a feat, and certainly not the famous annual event we're talking about! The Boat Race is a major sporting event, drawing huge crowds and media attention each year, solidifying rowing as the correct answer.
