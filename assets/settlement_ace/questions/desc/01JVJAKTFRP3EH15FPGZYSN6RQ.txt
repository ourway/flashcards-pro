William Shakespeare, often called England's national poet, lived from 1564 to 1616, during the Elizabethan era. He's considered one of the greatest writers in the English language, known for his plays and sonnets. His works are studied and performed worldwide, and his influence on the English language is immense â€“ he even invented many words and phrases we still use today! Now, while many famous stories exist, only some were written by Shakespeare. "A Midsummer Night's Dream," a comedy filled with fairies and mistaken identities, and "Romeo and Juliet," the tragic love story of two young people from feuding families, are definitely Shakespearean classics. "Pride and Prejudice" was written by Jane Austen in the 19th century, long after Shakespeare's time, and "Oliver Twist" is a novel by Charles Dickens, also from the 19th century. So, while those are great books, they weren't penned by the Bard himself.
