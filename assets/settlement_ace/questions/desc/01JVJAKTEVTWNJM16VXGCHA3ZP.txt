The fight for women's suffrage in the UK was a long and hard-fought battle. While many associate the initial breakthrough with 1918, that year only granted voting rights to women over the age of 30 who met certain property qualifications. This was a significant step, acknowledging women's contributions during World War I, but it wasn't full equality. Think about it: younger women who had also worked tirelessly during the war were still excluded. It wasn't until the Equal Franchise Act of 1928 that women finally achieved the right to vote on the same terms as men, meaning at the age of 21. So, while 1918 was important, 1928 is the year that truly marks equal voting rights for men and women in the UK. The other dates are incorrect because 1832 refers to the Great Reform Act, which expanded voting rights for men but didn't include women, and 1969 lowered the voting age for everyone to 18.
