Okay, let's talk about Police and Crime Commissioners, or PCCs. These roles were established as part of a broader effort to make policing more accountable to the public. Before PCCs, police authorities, made up of local councillors and independent members, oversaw the police. The government wanted to give the public a more direct say in how their local police force was run. So, the idea was to have directly elected individuals who would be responsible for setting the police force's strategic direction and budget, as well as holding the Chief Constable to account. The first elections for these Police and Crime Commissioners across England and Wales took place in November 2012. It was a pretty significant change in how policing was governed, aiming for greater transparency and public involvement. So, the statement that PCCs were elected in November 2012 is indeed correct.
