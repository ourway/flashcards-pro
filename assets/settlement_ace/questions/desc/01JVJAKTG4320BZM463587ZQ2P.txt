Dundee and Aberdeen are both prominent cities, but they're firmly rooted in Scotland, not Northern Ireland. Scotland and Northern Ireland are distinct parts of the United Kingdom, each with its own unique history and geography. Scotland, known for its Highlands, lochs, and vibrant culture, is located in the northern part of Great Britain. Northern Ireland, on the other hand, is part of the island of Ireland. Confusing them is a common mistake, especially for newcomers to the UK. Dundee, often called the "City of Discovery," sits on the east coast of Scotland and has a rich history in jute production and shipbuilding. Aberdeen, known as the "Granite City" because of its buildings, is a major port city in northeast Scotland and a hub for the oil industry. So, when you think of Dundee and Aberdeen, picture the Scottish Highlands and not the landscapes of Northern Ireland.
