Queen Victoria's reign is one of the longest and most impactful in British history, known as the Victorian era. She came to the throne at a relatively young age, which is why 1837 is the correct answer. Before Victoria, the throne was held by her uncle, William IV. He had no surviving legitimate children, so the crown passed to Victoria, who was his niece. She was only 18 years old at the time of her accession. The other dates are incorrect because they fall either later in her reign or after significant events. For example, 1861 was the year her beloved husband, Prince Albert, died, which led to a long period of mourning. So, remembering that Victoria became Queen as a young woman helps you pinpoint 1837 as the start of her long and influential rule.
