Boxing Day is actually celebrated on the 26th of December, the day *after* Christmas Day. It's a public holiday in the UK, meaning most people get the day off work. The origins of Boxing Day are a bit murky, but one popular theory is that it comes from the Victorian era. Wealthy landowners would box up gifts of money, food, and other useful items to give to their tenants and servants on this day. Another theory suggests it's linked to church alms boxes, where donations were collected for the poor and distributed after Christmas. So, while it's easy to get confused with all the Christmas festivities happening around the same time, remember that Boxing Day is all about what happens *after* the big Christmas celebration, not before. That's why the statement is false.
