Okay, let's talk about Scottish patron saints! Each of the UK's constituent countries has a patron saint, a figure regarded as a national protector. In Scotland's case, that's Saint Andrew. He was one of Jesus's twelve apostles. Now, he never actually set foot in Scotland during his lifetime. The story goes that some of his relics were brought to Scotland in the 4th century, and he gradually became associated with the country. What makes St. Andrew so distinctly Scottish is his cross. He was said to have been martyred on an X-shaped cross in Greece. This "saltire," as it's called, is the white cross you see on the Scottish flag, the Saltire or St Andrew's Cross. So, while St. George is the patron saint of England, St. Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland, and St. Edmund was an Anglo-Saxon king and later a saint, it's St. Andrew whose symbol is emblazoned on the Scottish flag, making him the clear choice for Scotland's patron saint.
