Okay, let's break down the difference between Catholics and Protestants. The key is in the name "Protestant." This refers to Christian groups that originated from the 16th-century Reformation, a major movement that protested against certain practices and doctrines of the Catholic Church. Think of figures like Martin Luther nailing his "95 Theses" to the church door â€“ that was a pivotal moment! Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists all emerged from this Protestant Reformation. They developed their own distinct theologies and church structures, separate from the Catholic Church. Catholicism, on the other hand, predates the Reformation by centuries. It represents the original branch of Christianity from which the Protestant denominations diverged. So, while all are Christian, Catholics didn't "protest" against the Catholic Church; they *are* the Catholic Church. A common misconception is thinking all Christians are the same, but understanding this historical split is crucial.
