Lent is a significant period in the Christian calendar, marking a time of reflection and preparation leading up to Easter. It's a 40-day period, mirroring the time Jesus spent fasting in the desert. The start of Lent is always Ash Wednesday. The name comes from the practice of placing ashes on the foreheads of worshippers as a sign of repentance. These ashes are traditionally made from the burning of palm crosses used in the previous year's Palm Sunday celebrations. So, Ash Wednesday is the day Christians begin this period of fasting, prayer, and penitence. Good Friday, on the other hand, is the day Christians commemorate the crucifixion of Jesus, which falls at the end of Lent. St. Valentine's Day is a completely separate cultural celebration of love and romance, with no religious connection to Lent.
