Mary Tudor, often remembered as "Bloody Mary," actually earned that grim nickname for her zealous efforts to restore Catholicism in England during her reign from 1553 to 1558. Her father, Henry VIII, had broken with the Catholic Church and established the Church of England. Edward VI, her half-brother, continued this Protestant direction. When Mary became queen, she was determined to reverse these changes and return England to the Catholic fold. To achieve this, she oversaw the persecution and execution of numerous Protestants who refused to renounce their faith. It's estimated that nearly 300 Protestants were burned at the stake during her reign, hence the "bloody" moniker. So, the statement is false because it incorrectly identifies Mary as a Protestant; she was a staunch Catholic who persecuted Protestants, not the other way around. A common misconception is confusing her with other monarchs or misremembering the religious conflicts of the Tudor period.
