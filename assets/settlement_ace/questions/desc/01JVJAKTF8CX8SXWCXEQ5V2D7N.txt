The iconic clock tower attached to the Palace of Westminster, often mistakenly referred to as "Big Ben," actually has two names to consider. "Big Ben" is technically the nickname for the largest of the tower's five bells, not the tower itself. The tower was originally simply called the Clock Tower. However, in 2012, to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, the tower was officially renamed the Elizabeth Tower. It's a tribute to her long and dedicated reign. So, while it's true the tower was renamed in honor of a Queen Elizabeth, it was Elizabeth II, the current monarch, not Elizabeth I, who reigned much earlier, from 1558 to 1603. Remembering that the renaming was a relatively recent event tied to the Diamond Jubilee might help you avoid confusing the two queens.
