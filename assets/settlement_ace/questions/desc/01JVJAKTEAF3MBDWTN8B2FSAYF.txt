Okay, let's talk about the shift to English as the language of power in England. For a long time after the Norman Conquest in 1066, French was the language of the ruling class, the court, and officialdom. Think about it: William the Conqueror and his successors were from Normandy in France, so French naturally became dominant. However, over the centuries, English gradually reasserted itself. By the late 14th century, a sense of English national identity was growing, fueled by events like the Hundred Years' War with France. This growing sense of identity led to a revival of the English language in all aspects of life. Around 1400, English officially became the language used in Parliament, the royal court, and for official documents. This was a significant turning point, solidifying English as the language of governance and marking a departure from the long-standing influence of French. It's worth noting that Geoffrey Chaucer, who wrote "The Canterbury Tales" in Middle English, was a key figure in this period, demonstrating the growing literary prestige of the language. So, while French influence remained, 1400 marks the formal return of English to the highest levels of power.
