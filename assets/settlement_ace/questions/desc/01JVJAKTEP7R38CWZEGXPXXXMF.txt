The Industrial Revolution, which really took off in the late 1700s and 1800s, saw massive changes in how goods were made. Factories sprung up, and they needed ways to get raw materials in and finished products out. Before railways became widespread, canals were the superhighways of the era. Think of them as the M1 of their day! They were a relatively cheap and efficient way to transport heavy goods like coal, iron ore, and textiles. Cities like Manchester and Liverpool thrived because of their canal links. While train tracks eventually surpassed canals in importance, they came later in the Industrial Revolution. Telephone poles are a much more modern invention, and ropeways, while used in some specific industries, weren't a primary method of connecting industrial areas. So, canals were the key infrastructure project that initially linked factories to the rest of the country during that period.
