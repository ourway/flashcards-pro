The Corn Laws, a hot topic in 19th-century Britain, were all about protecting British landowners and farmers. Think of "corn" in this context as referring to all grains, like wheat and barley, the staples of the British diet. Before 1846, these laws placed high tariffs on imported grain. This meant that foreign grain was more expensive, artificially inflating the price of British-grown grain. The idea was to keep British farmers in business and ensure a stable domestic supply. However, as Britain industrialized and its population grew, the Corn Laws became increasingly unpopular. They kept food prices high, hurting the working class who struggled to afford bread. The Anti-Corn Law League, led by Richard Cobden and John Bright, campaigned tirelessly for their repeal, arguing for free trade and cheaper food. Finally, in 1846, Parliament, under Prime Minister Robert Peel, repealed the Corn Laws, marking a significant shift towards free trade policies. So, the primary goal wasn't about railways, working conditions, or transportation; it was specifically about restricting the import of cheaper grain to protect domestic producers.
