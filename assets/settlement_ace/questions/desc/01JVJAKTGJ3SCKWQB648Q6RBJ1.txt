Okay, so in Northern Ireland, those newly qualified drivers have to display what's called an 'R' plate for a specific period. Think of the 'R' plate as standing for 'Restricted'. It's there to signal to other drivers that this person is relatively new to the roads and might need a bit more space or patience. The purpose of the 'R' plate is to increase road safety. Now, the key thing to remember is that this 'R' plate period lasts for one year from the date they passed their driving test. During this time, they also have a lower speed limit than fully qualified drivers â€“ they can't exceed 45 mph, even if the road's normal speed limit is higher. Once that year is up, they can switch to standard 'P' plates, or remove them altogether. So, the statement that a newly qualified driver must display an 'R' plate in Northern Ireland is true.
