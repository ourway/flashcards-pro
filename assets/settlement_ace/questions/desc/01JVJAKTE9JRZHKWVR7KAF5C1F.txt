The UK has a strong legal framework designed to prevent discrimination and promote equality. The cornerstone of this is the Equality Act 2010, which consolidates and strengthens previous anti-discrimination laws. This Act specifically protects individuals from unfair treatment based on several "protected characteristics." These include age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation. The Act covers various areas of life, including employment, education, housing, and the provision of goods and services. So, the laws are there to ensure people are treated fairly, not unfairly, based on those characteristics. It's a common trick in these tests to use double negatives or confusing wording, so always read carefully!
