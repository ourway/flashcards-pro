The House of Commons is where elected Members of Parliament, or MPs, debate and make laws. To ensure these debates are orderly and fair, there needs to be someone in charge. That person is the Speaker of the House. The Speaker is an MP who is elected by other MPs to be impartial and oversee the proceedings. Their job is to keep order, call on MPs to speak, and ensure the rules of Parliament are followed. They wear a special robe and sit in a high chair, symbolizing their authority. Now, it's easy to think the Prime Minister might be in charge because they're the head of the government, but the Prime Minister's role is to lead the government and answer questions, not to control the debates in the House. The Speaker is the referee, ensuring everyone gets a fair chance to be heard. So, the statement is false because the Speaker, not the Prime Minister, chairs debates in the House of Commons.
