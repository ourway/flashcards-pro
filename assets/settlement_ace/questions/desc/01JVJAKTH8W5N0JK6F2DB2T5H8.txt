The Victorian era, spanning from 1837 to 1901, was a period of significant economic change in Britain, largely driven by the Industrial Revolution. Free trade became a central tenet of British economic policy during this time. Think of it as the government wanting to make it easier and cheaper to buy and sell goods internationally. A key way they promoted this was by abolishing taxes, also known as tariffs or duties, on imported goods. These taxes made foreign products more expensive, hindering trade. By getting rid of many of them, the Victorian government aimed to lower costs for consumers and businesses, encourage competition, and boost overall economic growth. This policy was particularly championed by figures like Richard Cobden and John Bright, who believed in the benefits of open markets. Preventing the import of cheap raw materials or grain would be the opposite of free trade, as would abolishing the exportation of local produce, which would restrict trade rather than promote it.
