William Shakespeare, often called the Bard, is arguably the most famous writer in the English language. He lived from 1564 to 1616, during the Elizabethan era, a time of great artistic and cultural flourishing in England. He wrote numerous plays, including tragedies, comedies, and histories, that are still performed and studied worldwide. "Hamlet" is one of his most renowned tragedies, believed to have been written between 1599 and 1601. It tells the story of Prince Hamlet of Denmark, grappling with revenge, morality, and madness. The play is famous for its iconic soliloquies, especially "To be or not to be," which explores themes of life and death. The other options listed are not works by Shakespeare. While they might sound like titles of plays or literary works, they lack any connection to Shakespeare's known body of work. Remembering "Hamlet" and its famous "To be or not to be" soliloquy is a great way to recall Shakespeare's contribution to English literature.
