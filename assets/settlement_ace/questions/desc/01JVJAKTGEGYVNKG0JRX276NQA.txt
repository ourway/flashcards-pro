Okay, let's talk about the early days of voting in the UK. It's important to remember that the right to vote, or suffrage, wasn't always universal. In the beginning, it was extremely limited. Think back to a time when society was highly structured and land ownership was a sign of power and status. Initially, only men who owned property of a certain value were allowed to vote for members of Parliament. This was because owning property was seen as a sign of independence and a stake in the country's success. The idea was that only those with a financial interest in the nation should have a say in how it was governed. Women were excluded entirely from the political process at this stage. The idea of women voting was simply not part of the social or political landscape. It's easy to see why some might think women aged 30 had the right to vote, as this did happen later in 1918, but at the onset, no women had the right to vote.
