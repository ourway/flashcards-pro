Okay, so before you head off to vote in the UK, you'll receive a very important piece of mail: a poll card. Think of it as your personal invitation to participate in the democratic process. This card is specifically designed to tell you exactly where you need to go to cast your vote, which is your designated polling station. Polling stations are usually located in public buildings like schools or community centers. The poll card will include the address of your polling station, your name, and electoral number. It's really helpful to bring it along on election day, as it speeds up the process, although you don't actually *need* it to vote, as long as you're registered. Now, it's easy to confuse "poll card" with other similar terms. A "ballot paper" is the actual form you use to mark your choices in the voting booth. You don't receive a "ballot card" or "vote card" in the UK. The poll card is all about informing you of the location where you can exercise your right to vote.
