The UK has a long and rich history of animal welfare, dating back to the 19th century. This reflects a deep-seated cultural value of caring for animals. The PDSA, or People's Dispensary for Sick Animals, was founded in 1917 by Maria Dickin. She recognised that many animals belonging to poor families were suffering because their owners couldn't afford veterinary care. The PDSA provides free or low-cost veterinary services to pets of people in need. So, when you see PDSA, think of sick animals getting the care they need. The other charities listed focus on different areas: Crisis and Shelter work with homelessness, the NSPCC is dedicated to preventing child abuse, and Age UK supports older people. While all are worthy causes, only the PDSA is specifically dedicated to animal welfare, making it the correct answer. It's a good reminder that the UK's charitable sector is diverse, addressing a wide range of social needs.
