Scotland, despite not being the first place that comes to mind when you think of skiing, actually has a thriving winter sports scene! The Scottish Highlands, with their rugged mountains and reliable snowfall, provide a perfect environment for ski resorts. Now, while Europe's longest dry ski slope near Edinburgh is a great place to practice year-round, the real action happens in the mountains. There are five main ski centres spread across Scotland: Cairngorm Mountain, Glencoe Mountain Resort, Glenshee Ski Centre, Nevis Range, and The Lecht. Each offers a unique experience, from challenging black runs to gentle slopes for beginners. So, while two, three, or four might sound plausible, the correct number of ski centres operating in Scotland is indeed five. It's a testament to Scotland's diverse landscape and its ability to offer a wide range of outdoor activities, even winter sports!
