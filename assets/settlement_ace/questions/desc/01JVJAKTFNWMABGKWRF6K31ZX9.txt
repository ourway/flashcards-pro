Okay, let's explore the history of Jewish settlement in London. Jewish communities had existed in England since the Norman Conquest in 1066, but they faced increasing persecution, culminating in their expulsion by King Edward I in 1290. For over 350 years, Jews were officially banned from living in England. The readmission of Jews to England was a gradual process linked to the English Civil War and Oliver Cromwell's Protectorate. Cromwell, seeking to promote trade and recognizing the economic contributions of Jewish merchants, unofficially permitted them to return. While there wasn't a formal act of readmission, the year 1656 is significant because it marks the point when a group of Sephardic Jews, led by Rabbi Menasseh ben Israel, were permitted to settle and openly practice their religion in London. This marked the re-establishment of a Jewish community in London after centuries of absence, making 1656 the correct answer. While some individual Jews might have been present in England prior to this date, 1656 represents the formal re-establishment of a community.
