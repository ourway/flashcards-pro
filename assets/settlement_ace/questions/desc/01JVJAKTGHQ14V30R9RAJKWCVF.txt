Chequers is more than just a nice house; it's a symbol of leadership and a place of retreat for British Prime Ministers. The house, located in Buckinghamshire, was given to the nation in 1917 by Sir Arthur Lee with the express purpose of providing a country residence for the Prime Minister. This gift was intended to offer a place for relaxation and to host foreign dignitaries away from the hustle and bustle of London. It's been used by every Prime Minister since the 1920s. So, while the House of Lords is part of the UK parliament and Windsor Castle is a royal residence, neither serves as the specific country retreat designated for the Prime Minister. Chequers is uniquely designed for that purpose, offering a space for both private reflection and important informal meetings.
