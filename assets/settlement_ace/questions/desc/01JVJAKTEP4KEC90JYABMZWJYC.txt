The Tower of London's story begins with William the Conqueror, following his victory at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. He needed to establish control over London, and a formidable castle was the perfect way to do it. Construction began around 1078, with the central White Tower being the original structure. Think of it as William's imposing statement of power, a physical manifestation of Norman rule over the Anglo-Saxons. While the Tower has been expanded and modified by many monarchs since then, William the Conqueror was the one who initiated its construction. Oliver Cromwell lived much later, during the 17th century, and never had any involvement with the tower's construction. Queen Elizabeth II and Winston Churchill are also far too recent; the Tower was already ancient by their time. So, when you think of the Tower's origins, remember William the Conqueror and his need to assert his dominance over London.
