Henry VIII is a pivotal figure in British history, primarily known for his six wives and his role in the English Reformation. Before Henry, the Pope in Rome held significant power over religious matters in England. However, Henry wanted to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, because she hadn't produced a male heir. When the Pope refused to grant him an annulment, Henry took matters into his own hands. He broke with the Roman Catholic Church and established the Church of England, with himself as its head. This allowed him to divorce Catherine and marry Anne Boleyn. Anne Boleyn then became the mother of Elizabeth I. So, while Henry VII was indeed Henry VIII's father, he was not Elizabeth's father. Edward VI was Henry VIII's son, but not Elizabeth's brother. Richard III ruled long before Henry VIII. Therefore, Henry VIII is the correct answer because he was the King who married Anne Boleyn, and she gave birth to Queen Elizabeth I.
