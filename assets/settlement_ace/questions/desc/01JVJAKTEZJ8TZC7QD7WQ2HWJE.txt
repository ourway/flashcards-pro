The Bayeux Tapestry is a massive, embroidered cloth nearly 70 metres long that tells the story of a very specific event: the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. This was a huge turning point in British history, marking the end of Anglo-Saxon rule and the beginning of Norman influence, which brought significant changes to language, law, and culture. The tapestry vividly depicts the events leading up to and including the Battle of Hastings, where William the Conqueror defeated King Harold's English forces. It shows everything from the preparations for the invasion to the actual fighting on the battlefield. While other battles like Bosworth, Agincourt and the Boyne were important, they occurred much later and are not the subject of the Bayeux Tapestry. The tapestry is a unique visual record of the Norman Conquest, making Hastings the only possible answer. Itâ€™s a fascinating primary source that gives us insight into this pivotal moment in British history.
