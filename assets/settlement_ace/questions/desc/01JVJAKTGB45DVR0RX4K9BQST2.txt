Gaining permanent residency, or indefinite leave to remain, in the UK is a significant step, but it's important to understand what it actually entails. Think of it as permission to live in the UK without immigration restrictions. It grants you the right to live, work, and study here without a time limit. However, it doesn't automatically guarantee you a job. The UK job market is competitive, and even with permanent residency, you'll still need to actively search for employment, meet the job requirements, and be selected by an employer. Your residency status simply removes immigration barriers to employment; it doesn't create a job for you. Some people might mistakenly believe that permanent residency equates to guaranteed employment, perhaps because they associate it with the right to work. But remember, the right to work is different from the guarantee of a job.
