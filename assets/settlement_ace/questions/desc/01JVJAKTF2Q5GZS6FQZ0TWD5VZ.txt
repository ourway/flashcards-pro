Okay, let's talk about the Battle of Waterloo. To understand why this is the final major conflict between Great Britain and France, we need to rewind a bit. Think about Napoleon Bonaparte â€“ a brilliant but ambitious French leader who dominated Europe in the early 19th century. Britain was constantly at odds with Napoleon, forming alliances to try and contain his power. The Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 was a crucial naval victory for Britain, crippling Napoleon's plans to invade. However, it didn't end the conflict. Napoleon was eventually defeated and exiled, but he briefly returned to power in 1815. This led to the Battle of Waterloo, fought in present-day Belgium. Here, the Duke of Wellington, leading British and allied forces, decisively defeated Napoleon. This defeat marked the end of Napoleon's reign and the end of major military conflicts between Britain and France. While battles like Hastings in 1066 and Agincourt in 1415 were significant Anglo-French conflicts, they happened centuries earlier. Waterloo is the one that slams the door shut on that long period of major warfare.
