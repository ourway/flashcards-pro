The House of Lords, the UK's second chamber of Parliament, indeed operates with a greater degree of independence from the government than, say, the House of Commons. This independence stems from the way its members are appointed and the roles they fulfill. Unlike Members of Parliament (MPs) in the Commons who are elected by the public and often heavily influenced by party politics, Lords are appointed, often for life, based on their expertise and contributions to society. Many are crossbenchers, meaning they don't align with any political party. This composition allows them to scrutinize legislation and hold the government to account with less partisan pressure. They can bring a wealth of experience from various fields, offering different perspectives that might be missed in the more politically charged environment of the Commons. While the government proposes laws, the Lords can amend or even reject them, providing a crucial check and balance within the UK's parliamentary system.
