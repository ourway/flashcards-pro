Okay, let's break down the origins of the English language. Modern English is a fascinating mix of different influences, but its core foundation comes primarily from two sources: Anglo-Saxon and Norman French. Anglo-Saxon, also known as Old English, was the language spoken by the Germanic tribes – the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes – who migrated to Britain from around the 5th century AD. This forms the bedrock of English grammar and many common words. Then, in 1066, the Norman Conquest happened. William the Conqueror, who spoke Norman French, invaded and became King of England. For several centuries, Norman French became the language of the ruling class, law, and administration. Over time, Norman French blended with Anglo-Saxon, enriching the vocabulary with words related to law, government, cuisine, and fashion. This fusion is why English has so many words with similar meanings, one from Anglo-Saxon and one from French – like "house" and "mansion," or "freedom" and "liberty." While Celtic languages like Gaelic did exist in Britain before the Anglo-Saxons, they didn't contribute as significantly to the *foundation* of modern English.
