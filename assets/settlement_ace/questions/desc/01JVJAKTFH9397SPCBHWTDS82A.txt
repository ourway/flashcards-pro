Halloween, celebrated on October 31st, has evolved over centuries from ancient Celtic harvest festivals and Samhain, a time when spirits were believed to roam the earth. The tradition of dressing up in costumes originated as a way to ward off these spirits, who were thought to cause mischief. Over time, this practice merged with other customs, including "souling," where poor people would go door-to-door offering prayers for the dead in exchange for food. This eventually evolved into "guising," where people would dress up and perform a trick or song in exchange for treats. When Irish and Scottish immigrants brought Halloween to North America in the 19th century, these customs were adapted and popularized. "Trick-or-treating," where children dress up in costumes and go door-to-door asking for sweets, became a widespread tradition in the 20th century. While Halloween traditions vary across the UK, trick-or-treating is definitely a common practice, especially among younger people, making the statement true.
