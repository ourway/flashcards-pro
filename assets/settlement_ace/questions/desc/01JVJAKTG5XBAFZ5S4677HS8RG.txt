The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 53 independent and equal countries. Most of these were formerly part of the British Empire. It's important to remember that the Commonwealth isn't about political control like the old Empire was. Instead, it's a cooperative network. Think of it as a club where members share values like democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Queen Elizabeth II was the Head of the Commonwealth, a symbolic role representing the association's history. While the number of member states has fluctuated over time as countries join or leave, it's currently at 53. So, while other numbers might sound plausible, remembering that the Commonwealth is a large but specific group of nations will help you recall the correct figure. The other options are incorrect because they don't reflect the actual membership count of this unique international organization.
