Haggis is undeniably Scotland's national dish, deeply embedded in its cultural identity. It's a savoury pudding traditionally made with sheep's pluck – that's the heart, liver, and lungs – minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and stock, all encased in the animal's stomach and simmered. While the ingredients might sound unusual to some, haggis has been a part of Scottish cuisine for centuries, with recipes varying from region to region and family to family. It's particularly associated with Burns Night, celebrated annually on January 25th to commemorate the birth of Scotland's national poet, Robert Burns, who famously wrote "Address to a Haggis." On this night, haggis is ceremoniously piped in, addressed with Burns' poem, and enjoyed with neeps (mashed turnips) and tatties (mashed potatoes). While you might find variations of similar dishes in other parts of the UK, haggis, in its specific form and cultural significance, is uniquely Scottish.
