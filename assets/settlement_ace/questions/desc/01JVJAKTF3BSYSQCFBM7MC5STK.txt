The Highland Clearances were a really dark period in Scottish history, primarily during the 18th and 19th centuries. It had absolutely nothing to do with slave rebellions. Instead, it was driven by economic interests of landowners. Basically, clan chiefs and landlords realized they could make more money by raising sheep for wool production than by having tenant farmers on their land. So, they forcibly evicted thousands of Gaelic-speaking Highlanders from their ancestral homes. These people were often relocated to marginal coastal lands or forced to emigrate overseas, often to Canada or Australia. The clearances caused immense suffering and devastated Highland communities. While slavery was a terrible part of British history too, it was a separate issue and not the cause of the Highland Clearances. So, the idea that a slave rebellion triggered the clearances is completely false; it was all about landlords wanting to maximize profits from sheep farming.
