Okay, let's break down why EastEnders and Coronation Street are indeed renowned soap operas in the UK. Soap operas are a staple of British television culture, and these two are arguably the most iconic examples. Coronation Street, often just called "Corrie," has been running since 1960, making it the longest-running TV soap opera in the world! It's set in the fictional town of Weatherfield, a suburb of Manchester, and focuses on the everyday lives and dramas of its working-class residents. EastEnders, which started in 1985, is set in the fictional London borough of Walford, portraying the lives of people in the East End of London. Both shows are known for their realistic portrayals of British life, tackling social issues, and creating memorable characters. They regularly attract millions of viewers and have become deeply embedded in the national consciousness. So, while there are other popular soaps, the sheer longevity, cultural impact, and consistent viewership of EastEnders and Coronation Street make them undeniably "renowned."
