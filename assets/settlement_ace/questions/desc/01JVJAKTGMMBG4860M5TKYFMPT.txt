Father's Day is an annual celebration dedicated to honouring fathers and father figures. While its origins can be traced back to the early 20th century in the United States, the modern Father's Day celebration is largely credited to Sonora Smart Dodd, who wanted to honour her father, a Civil War veteran who raised six children as a single parent. She initially proposed June 5th, her father's birthday, but the celebration was moved to the third Sunday in June to give pastors enough time to prepare sermons on the topic. The tradition quickly gained popularity and was eventually recognized nationally. So, while Mother's Day is celebrated in May, and Bonfire Night and Halloween are autumn events, Father's Day is specifically observed on the third Sunday of June each year, making it the correct answer. It's a day for showing appreciation with cards, gifts, and quality time spent with dads.
