Boxing Day, celebrated on December 26th, has its roots in a couple of different traditions. One popular theory is that it originated in the Victorian era when wealthy landowners would box up gifts of money, food, and other useful items to give to their servants and employees the day after Christmas. This was a way of showing gratitude for their year-round service and allowing them to celebrate after they had finished serving their masters on Christmas Day. Another possible origin is related to alms boxes placed in churches during the Advent season to collect money for the poor, which would be distributed after Christmas. So, while Halloween is a completely different holiday with pagan roots, Christmas Eve is the day *before* Christmas, and New Year's Day marks the start of a new year, Boxing Day specifically refers to the day after Christmas, making December 26th the correct answer.
