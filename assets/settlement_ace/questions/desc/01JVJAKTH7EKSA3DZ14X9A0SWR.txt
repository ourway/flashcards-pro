Political parties are like engines that run on public support and funding, and their main goal is to win elections. Think of them as constantly preparing, but they don't go full throttle all the time. The period leading up to an election is when they really kick into high gear. This is when they launch their major advertising campaigns, hold rallies, release their manifestos (which are like their promises to the voters), and generally try to convince as many people as possible to vote for them. It's a crucial time because the outcome of the election determines which party gets to form the government and implement its policies. While political parties are involved in discussions and debates year-round, it's the election period that demands the most intense activity. Natural disasters and terrorist threats are times when the government and emergency services take the lead, not necessarily when political parties ramp up their campaigns.
