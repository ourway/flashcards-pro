Okay, let's talk about religious festivals in the UK. While the UK is a diverse and multicultural society with people celebrating all sorts of religious holidays, when we talk about the *main* religious festivals, we're really focusing on the Christian calendar. Christianity has historically been the dominant religion in the UK, and its major festivals are deeply embedded in the culture. Easter, celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ, is a huge event, marked by traditions like Easter egg hunts and hot cross buns. Then there's Christmas, commemorating the birth of Jesus, which is probably the biggest holiday of the year, with Christmas trees, presents, and festive meals. Now, while Halloween has pagan roots and New Year's is a significant cultural event, they aren't primarily considered *religious* festivals in the same way as Easter and Christmas. So, while you might enjoy dressing up for Halloween or celebrating the start of a new year, Easter and Christmas are the key religious festivals celebrated across the UK.
