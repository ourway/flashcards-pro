The emblem of the House of Tudor is two roses. To understand why, we need to go back to the Wars of the Roses, a series of English civil wars in the 15th century. On one side was the House of Lancaster, symbolized by a red rose, and on the other was the House of York, represented by a white rose. These families fought for the English throne for decades. The conflict finally ended when Henry Tudor, who had Lancastrian connections, defeated Richard III of York at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Henry then married Elizabeth of York, uniting the two houses. To symbolize this union and bring an end to the wars, the Tudor rose was created, combining the red rose of Lancaster and the white rose of York. This new rose became the emblem of the Tudor dynasty, representing peace, unity, and the beginning of a new era in English history. So, while the thistle is associated with Scotland, the lion can be a symbol of England, and the dragon is the symbol of Wales, neither of these are the emblem of the House of Tudor.
