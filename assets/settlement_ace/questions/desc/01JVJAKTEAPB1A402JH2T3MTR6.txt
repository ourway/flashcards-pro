Skara Brae offers a fascinating glimpse into Neolithic life in Britain, dating back over 5,000 years â€“ that's even older than Stonehenge! This remarkably preserved village was uncovered by a storm in 1850 on the coast of Orkney, an archipelago off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The structures were built from local stone, and because they were buried in sand for centuries, the houses, with their stone furniture like beds and cupboards, survived remarkably well. Orkney, being part of Scotland, makes Scotland the correct answer. While England, Wales, and Northern Ireland all have their own rich prehistoric sites, none can claim Skara Brae. Thinking about the rugged Scottish coastline and the wild beauty of the Orkney Islands should help you remember this one!
