Northern Ireland's political history is quite unique and, unfortunately, marked by periods of instability. The Northern Ireland Assembly, established as part of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, aimed to bring an end to decades of conflict known as "The Troubles." This agreement created a power-sharing government between unionist and nationalist parties. However, due to disagreements and breakdowns in trust between these parties, the Assembly has been suspended several times. These suspensions occurred when the power-sharing arrangements collapsed, and the government couldn't function effectively. Direct rule from Westminster was then imposed. The Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, while also devolved bodies, haven't experienced these kinds of suspensions. Their political landscapes have been more stable. So, when you think of devolved administrations and suspensions, remember the specific historical and political context of Northern Ireland.
