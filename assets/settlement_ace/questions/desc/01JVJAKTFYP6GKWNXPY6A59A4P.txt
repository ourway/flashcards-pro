Wales, one of the four countries that make up the United Kingdom, has a rich history and distinct cultural identity. While it's a prominent part of the UK, geographically and culturally, its population is smaller compared to England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Think of the UK population as a pie chart. England, being the largest and most populous, takes up the biggest slice. Scotland has a significant portion, and Northern Ireland a smaller one. Wales, with its stunning landscapes and vibrant traditions, accounts for approximately 5% of the total UK population. This relatively smaller percentage reflects its land area and historical population trends. The other options, 8%, 3%, and 1%, are incorrect because they either overestimate or underestimate the actual proportion of the UK population residing in Wales. So, while Wales is a vital part of the UK, its population is around 5% of the total.
