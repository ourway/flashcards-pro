The Youth Court is a specialized part of the UK legal system designed to deal with young offenders. It's crucial to understand the specific age range it covers. The Youth Court handles cases involving individuals aged between 10 and 17 years old who are accused of committing a crime. This age bracket reflects the age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales, which is set at 10 â€“ one of the lowest in Europe. So, while it might seem logical that the Youth Court would handle cases up to age 21, especially considering the transition into adulthood, the actual cut-off is 17. Once someone turns 18, they are considered an adult in the eyes of the law and their cases are heard in adult courts, such as the Magistrates' Court or the Crown Court, depending on the severity of the crime. Therefore, the statement that the Youth Court hears cases for those under 21 is incorrect because the upper age limit is 17.
