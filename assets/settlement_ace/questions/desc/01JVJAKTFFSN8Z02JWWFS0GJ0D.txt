The jury system in the UK is a cornerstone of its legal system, designed to ensure trials are fair and decided by ordinary citizens, not just legal professionals. The idea is that your peers, people from your community, should judge your case. To make this happen, jurors are selected randomly. The pool of potential jurors is drawn from the Electoral Register, which lists all eligible voters in a local area. This register is used because it's the most comprehensive list of adult citizens available. Using the Electoral Register ensures that the jury selection process is random and representative of the community. This random selection is crucial to avoid bias and guarantee impartiality. While it might seem logical to draw jurors from a "Jury Register," no such register exists. The Electoral Register provides the necessary breadth and randomness for jury selection.
