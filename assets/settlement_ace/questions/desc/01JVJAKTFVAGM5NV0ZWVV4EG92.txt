Okay, let's talk about who's really in charge of making government policies in the UK. While the UK has a monarch, their role is largely symbolic these days. Think of them more as a figurehead, representing the country and carrying out ceremonial duties. And while judges are incredibly important for interpreting laws and ensuring justice, they don't actually create the policies themselves. That responsibility falls to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. The Cabinet is a group of senior government ministers, chosen by the Prime Minister, who head up different departments like health, education, or finance. They meet regularly to discuss the big issues facing the country and decide on the best course of action. The Prime Minister leads these meetings and ultimately has the final say, but it's a collaborative process. So, when it comes to deciding what the government will do, it's the Prime Minister and Cabinet who are calling the shots.
