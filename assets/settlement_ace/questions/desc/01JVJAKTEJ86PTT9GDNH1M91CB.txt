April Fools' Day, celebrated on the 1st of April, is a tradition with origins that are a bit murky, but it's been a popular custom in Britain for centuries. Some historians believe it may be linked to the shift from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century, where those slow to get the news or resistant to the change were mocked. Over time, it evolved into a day of lighthearted pranks and practical jokes. The key thing to remember is that the fun is meant to be over by midday. After 12 noon, anyone playing a prank is considered the "April Fool" themselves! So, while the idea of playing pranks all day might seem tempting, the tradition dictates a strict cut-off point. This midday deadline is a long-standing convention, making it a unique and quirky part of British culture.
