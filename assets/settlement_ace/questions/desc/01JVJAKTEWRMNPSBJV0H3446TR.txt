Okay, so "Auld Lang Syne" is the song you'll hear belted out across the UK as the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Eve. The song's title translates from Scots as "old long since" or "days gone by," and it's all about remembering old friends and good times. It was written by the Scottish poet Robert Burns in 1788, and he claimed it was based on an even older folk song. The tradition of singing it at New Year's, or Hogmanay as it's known in Scotland, became popular in the late 18th century and spread throughout the English-speaking world. While the British National Anthem is obviously important, it's reserved for more formal occasions. And while "Jingle Bells" and "White Christmas" are popular Christmas songs, they aren't specifically associated with New Year's celebrations in the UK. So, if you want to blend in at a New Year's party, make sure you know at least the first verse of "Auld Lang Syne"!
