To vote in any UK election, whether it's for Members of Parliament in a general election, local councillors, or even the Scottish or Welsh Parliaments, you absolutely must be on the electoral register. Think of it like this: the electoral register is the official list of everyone who's eligible to vote. It's how the government knows who you are, where you live, and that you're allowed to participate in the democratic process. Registering isn't automatic; you have to actively sign up. This is to prevent fraud and ensure that only eligible citizens are voting. While it might seem like a hassle, being on the register is a fundamental part of your rights and responsibilities as a resident of the UK. It's also used for things like jury service selection, so it's important to be included. So, while you might think you can just show up at a polling station with your ID, that won't work. You need to be on that list!
