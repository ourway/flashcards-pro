Okay, let's break down why Sir Roger Bannister and Mo Farah are the renowned athletes in this list. Think about British sporting achievements. Sir Roger Bannister is famous for being the first person to run a mile in under four minutes, a feat he accomplished in 1954. This was a huge deal at the time, pushing the boundaries of human athletic ability and capturing the public's imagination. Then we have Mo Farah, a more recent sporting hero. He's a long-distance runner who has won multiple Olympic gold medals and world championships for Great Britain. He's known for his incredible endurance and his signature "Mobot" celebration. Now, the other names might sound familiar, but they belong to different fields. Henry Moore was a very important sculptor, known for his large bronze abstract figures, and John Barbour was a 14th-century Scottish poet, famous for his epic poem "The Bruce" about Robert the Bruce. So, while they were significant figures in their own right, they weren't athletes.
