Okay, let's talk about the age restrictions surrounding tobacco in the UK. Public health has become a major focus over the last few decades, and one key aspect of this is reducing smoking rates, particularly among young people. Studies have consistently shown that the earlier someone starts smoking, the more likely they are to become addicted and suffer long-term health consequences. To combat this, the government has implemented various measures, including raising awareness, providing support for quitting, and, crucially, setting a legal age for purchasing tobacco products. This age is 18. The reasoning behind this specific age is that it aligns with other legal responsibilities and rights granted at 18, such as voting and entering into contracts. So, it's absolutely true that selling tobacco to anyone under 18 is against the law in the UK. This law is strictly enforced to protect young people from the harms of smoking and nicotine addiction. While some might think younger teenagers should be able to make their own choices, the law prioritizes their long-term health and well-being, recognizing the addictive nature of tobacco.
