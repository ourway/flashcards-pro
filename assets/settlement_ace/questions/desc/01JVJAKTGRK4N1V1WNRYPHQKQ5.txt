Okay, so in the UK political system, most Members of Parliament, or MPs, are affiliated with a specific political party like the Conservatives, Labour, or the Liberal Democrats. These parties have established platforms and structures. However, sometimes individuals run for Parliament and win without belonging to any of these established parties. These individuals might have very specific local concerns, or perhaps they disagree with the mainstream parties on key issues. Because they aren't part of a larger political organization, they're called "Independents." This term reflects their status as being free from party control and able to vote according to their own conscience or the needs of their constituents. The other options just aren't terms used in UK politics to describe MPs who don't belong to a party. Thinking of them as "independent" thinkers or actors can help you remember the correct term.
