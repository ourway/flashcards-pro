The development of the jet engine is a key moment in aviation history, but it happened much later than the 1890s. The 1890s were a time of steam power and early internal combustion engines, think of the first cars and rudimentary airplanes. Jet engine technology simply wasn't there yet. The true pioneer of the jet engine in Britain was Sir Frank Whittle. He patented his design for a turbojet engine in 1930, and the first successful test flight of a jet-powered aircraft took place in 1941 using his engine. Sir Robert Watson-Watt, on the other hand, was a pioneer in the development of radar, a crucial technology during World War II. So, while Watson-Watt made vital contributions to British technology, the jet engine belongs to Whittle. It's easy to get confused with all the inventors and dates, but remember Whittle and the 1930s for the jet engine.
