Forced marriage is a serious human rights violation, and the UK has taken steps to combat it. The introduction of Forced Marriage Protection Orders was a key moment in this effort. These orders are designed to prevent forced marriages from taking place and to provide support to victims. The legislation allowing these orders came into effect in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland in 2008. Think of it this way: 2008 was a year of increased protection for vulnerable individuals. While the issue of forced marriage was certainly being discussed and addressed before and after this year, the specific legal framework offering these protection orders was established in 2008. It's easy to get confused with other years when related legislation might have been debated or passed, but remember 2008 as the year these specific protection orders became a legal reality.
