The 'Divine Right of Kings' was a political and religious doctrine asserting that a monarch's legitimacy came directly from God. This idea gained prominence in Europe, especially during the 16th and 17th centuries, as monarchs sought to consolidate their power. The belief was that God chose the king to rule, making him accountable only to God, not to his subjects, the aristocracy, or any parliament. This meant the king's authority was absolute, and any attempt to challenge him was seen as defying God's will. Think of it as the ultimate job security, granted by a higher power! This concept was used to justify royal power and suppress dissent. While some might think it increased the power of parliament or reduced the power of the nobles, the Divine Right actually did the opposite, bolstering the king's authority above all other institutions and individuals.
