The National Assembly for Wales, now known as the Senedd, operates under a system designed to ensure fair representation of different political viewpoints. This system, a form of proportional representation, aims to reflect the overall preferences of the electorate more accurately than a simple "winner takes all" approach. To keep the Assembly accountable and responsive to the changing needs and opinions of the Welsh people, elections are held at regular intervals. These elections are scheduled every four years. This timeframe allows enough time for the elected members to implement policies and demonstrate their effectiveness, while also ensuring that the public has a frequent opportunity to voice their approval or disapproval through the ballot box. Choosing a shorter interval, like one or two years, would likely lead to political instability and make it difficult to enact meaningful change. A longer interval, such as five years, might make the Assembly less responsive to the immediate concerns of the population. Therefore, four years strikes a balance between stability and accountability.
