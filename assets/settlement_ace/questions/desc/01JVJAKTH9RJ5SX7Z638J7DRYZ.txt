Okay, let's break down why Crisis and Shelter are the charities specifically focused on homelessness. Understanding the purpose of different charities is key here. While the British Red Cross provides emergency assistance in various crises, both domestic and international, their focus is broader than just homelessness. Age UK, as the name suggests, concentrates on supporting older people, addressing issues like loneliness, poverty, and health among the elderly. The National Trust is dedicated to preserving historical buildings and natural landscapes. Crisis and Shelter, on the other hand, are organizations specifically established to tackle homelessness. Shelter, founded in 1966, campaigns for policy changes and provides advice and support to people facing homelessness. Crisis offers immediate assistance like temporary accommodation, food, and healthcare, alongside longer-term support to help people rebuild their lives and find permanent housing. So, while the other charities do vital work, Crisis and Shelter are the ones directly addressing the needs of homeless individuals.
