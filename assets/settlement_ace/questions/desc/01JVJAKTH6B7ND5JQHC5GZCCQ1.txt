The United Kingdom is made up of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. While each country has its own distinct identity, history, and culture, England is by far the most populous. This is largely due to its size, economic opportunities, and historical significance as the center of the British Empire. Think of the UK as a demographic pie chart. England takes up the vast majority of that pie, accounting for approximately 84% of the total population. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland share the remaining portion. The other answer options might seem plausible, but they don't reflect the actual distribution of people across the UK. Remembering that England is the most densely populated area due to factors like its large cities and industrial history helps clarify why 84% is the right figure.
