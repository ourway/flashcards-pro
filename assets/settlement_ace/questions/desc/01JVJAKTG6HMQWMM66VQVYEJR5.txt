The Bill of Rights, passed in 1689, was a really important document in British history, but it's easy to misunderstand what it actually did. Think of it as a key step in limiting the power of the monarchy and establishing parliamentary supremacy after the Glorious Revolution. It outlined rights like freedom of speech in Parliament and protection from cruel and unusual punishment. However, it primarily benefited wealthy landowners and the political elite. Voting rights were still very restricted at this time. The idea of universal suffrage – every adult having the right to vote – was still a long way off. It took centuries of reform, including the Reform Acts of the 19th century and the Representation of the People Act in the 20th century, to gradually expand the franchise. So, while the Bill of Rights was significant, it didn't suddenly give everyone the right to vote. That's why the statement is false.
