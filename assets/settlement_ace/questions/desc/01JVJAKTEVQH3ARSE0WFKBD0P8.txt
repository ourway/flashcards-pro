Florence Nightingale is synonymous with the development of modern nursing. In the mid-19th century, during the Crimean War (1853-1856), she famously led a team of nurses to care for wounded British soldiers. Conditions in the military hospitals were appalling: unsanitary, overcrowded, and lacking basic supplies. Nightingale implemented rigorous hygiene practices, dramatically reducing infection rates and mortality. Her meticulous record-keeping and statistical analysis demonstrated the importance of sanitation in healthcare, pioneering evidence-based practice. She became known as "The Lady with the Lamp" for her tireless work tending to patients at night. After the war, she established the Nightingale Training School at St. Thomas' Hospital in London in 1860, setting a new standard for nurse education. This school emphasized practical training, discipline, and a commitment to patient care, shaping the profession as we know it today. While engineering, shipbuilding, and policing are all important fields, they have no direct connection to Nightingale's groundbreaking contributions to healthcare.
