The Northern Ireland Assembly, established as part of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, is a key institution in Northern Ireland's devolved government. The Assembly's primary role is to legislate on a range of transferred matters, such as education, health, and the environment, and to hold the executive branch accountable. Initially, the Assembly had 108 members, with each of the 18 parliamentary constituencies returning six members. However, in 2017, the number of members was reduced to 90, with each constituency returning five members. Therefore, the correct answer is 108, reflecting the historical composition of the Assembly before the reduction in 2017. While the other numbers might seem plausible, they don't align with the specific structure established for the Northern Ireland Assembly at its inception.
