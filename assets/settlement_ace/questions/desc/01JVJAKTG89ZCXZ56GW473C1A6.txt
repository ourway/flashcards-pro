Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee marked 60 years on the throne, a truly significant milestone in British history. Think about it: only Queen Victoria had previously reached that mark! Jubilees are important national celebrations, and the Diamond Jubilee in 2012 was a particularly big deal. There were huge parades, concerts, and street parties all over the UK. One of the most visible signs of the Jubilee was the renaming of the iconic clock tower at the Houses of Parliament to Elizabeth Tower, a permanent tribute to her reign. So, while 2010, 2011, and 2013 were all years within her long reign, 2012 is the specific year that the Diamond Jubilee celebrations took place, making it the correct answer. It's a date firmly etched in recent British memory, and a reminder of the Queen's dedication to the country.
