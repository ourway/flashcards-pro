Okay, let's break down why defence, taxation, foreign affairs, and social security remain under the UK Government's control, despite debates in the Welsh Assembly and Scottish Parliament. Think of it this way: when the UK devolved power, meaning they gave some decision-making authority to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, they didn't hand over *everything*. Certain core areas were reserved to ensure the UK could act as a unified nation on the world stage and maintain a consistent standard of living across the country. Defence, of course, is about protecting the entire UK, so it makes sense for that to be a central responsibility. Taxation is key because the UK government needs to raise revenue to fund national services and manage the economy as a whole. Foreign affairs, dealing with other countries, needs a single voice to represent the UK's interests effectively. Finally, social security, things like pensions and unemployment benefits, are managed nationally to ensure a baseline level of support for all UK citizens, regardless of where they live. While education, environment, police, and transport are important, these are areas where the devolved administrations have the power to tailor policies to their specific needs and priorities.
