Okay, let's talk about the Bill of Rights. To understand its significance, we need to rewind to the 17th century, a time of major power struggles between the monarchy and Parliament. Think of figures like King Charles I, who believed in the divine right of kings â€“ the idea that he was appointed by God and therefore above the law. This clashed dramatically with Parliament, which wanted more say in how the country was run, especially regarding things like taxation and laws. After a civil war and a brief period of republican rule, the monarchy was restored, but tensions remained. The Bill of Rights, passed in 1689 after the Glorious Revolution, was a pivotal moment. It firmly established that the monarch could not rule without the consent of Parliament. Specifically, it limited the powers of the monarch and guaranteed certain rights and liberties to the people. So, the Bill of Rights wasn't about boosting the King's power; quite the opposite! It marked a clear shift towards parliamentary sovereignty, solidifying Parliament's increased power and setting the stage for the constitutional monarchy we know today.
