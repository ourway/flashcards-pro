The story of Charles Edward Stuart, often called Bonnie Prince Charlie or the Young Pretender, is deeply intertwined with the Scottish Highlands. In the 18th century, the Stuart family had lost the British throne, and Charles was attempting to reclaim it. The Highlands, with its clan system and strong Jacobite sympathies (supporters of the Stuart claim), became the heartland of his support. While cities like Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen were important centers in Scotland, they were more diverse in their loyalties. The Highland clans, with their traditional structures and warrior culture, provided the bulk of Charles's fighting force during the Jacobite rising of 1745. Think of the iconic image of kilted Highlanders charging into battle â€“ that's the essence of why the Highlands are the correct answer. Although some individuals in other regions supported Charles, the Highlands were the main source of his military and political backing.
