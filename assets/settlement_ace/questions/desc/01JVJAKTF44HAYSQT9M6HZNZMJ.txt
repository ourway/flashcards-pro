Devolution in the UK refers to the transfer of power from the central government in Westminster to regional governments. This process began in the late 1990s as a way to better represent the distinct identities and needs of different parts of the UK. Think of it like giving local areas more control over their own affairs. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland each have their own devolved governments with varying degrees of power. Scotland has the most extensive powers, including control over areas like education and healthcare. Wales has powers over similar areas, though historically less extensive than Scotland. Northern Ireland's devolved government is unique due to its power-sharing agreement designed to represent both unionist and nationalist communities. England, however, does not have its own devolved government; it is directly governed by the UK Parliament. So, while it might be tempting to think England should be included, devolution specifically refers to the transfer of power to the other three regions.
