The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man have a unique relationship with the UK. They're not part of the United Kingdom itself, nor are they members of the European Union. Instead, they're known as Crown Dependencies. This means the British monarch is their Head of State, but they have their own governments, laws, and even their own currencies. Historically, the Isle of Man has its own parliament, Tynwald, which claims to be over 1,000 years old, making it one of the oldest continuous parliaments in the world. The Channel Islands, closer to France, were part of the Duchy of Normandy, and this connection is why they pledge allegiance to the Crown. So, while they rely on the UK for defense and international relations, they maintain independence in many areas. Northern Ireland, on the other hand, *is* part of the United Kingdom, along with England, Scotland, and Wales.
