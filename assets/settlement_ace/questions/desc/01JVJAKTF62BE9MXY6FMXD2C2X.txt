The idea that a husband couldn't be charged with raping his wife was, shockingly, a long-held legal principle rooted in outdated views of marriage. Historically, marriage was seen as a woman giving irrevocable consent to sexual relations. This meant that, legally, a wife couldn't refuse her husband. However, this view began to change significantly in the late 20th century as societal attitudes towards women and marital rape evolved. The concept of marital rape became more widely recognised as a crime, reflecting a broader understanding of consent and bodily autonomy. The landmark legal change came in 1991 when the House of Lords ruled that a husband could indeed be charged with raping his wife. This decision overturned centuries of legal precedent and affirmed that consent is always necessary for sexual activity, regardless of marital status. So, the statement is true because the law now unequivocally recognizes that a husband can be charged with rape if he forces his wife to have sex without her consent.
