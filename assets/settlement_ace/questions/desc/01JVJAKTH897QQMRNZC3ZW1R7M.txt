Okay, let's talk about the powers of the police in maintaining public order. In the UK, police officers have specific legal powers designed to prevent crime and ensure public safety. One of these powers relates to alcohol consumption in public places, particularly when it involves young people. The law allows police to confiscate alcohol if they believe someone is drinking in a designated public space where it's prohibited, or if they reasonably suspect that a young person under 18 is in possession of alcohol. Furthermore, police have the authority to direct individuals, including young people, to leave a public area if they believe their presence is causing, or is likely to cause, anti-social behaviour, disorder, or harassment. This power is often used to disperse groups loitering late at night or causing a disturbance. These measures are in place to protect young people from harm, prevent public disorder, and maintain a safe environment for everyone. So, the police do indeed have these authorities.
