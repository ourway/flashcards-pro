William the Conqueror, after his victory at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, needed to understand exactly what he had conquered. He wanted to know who owned what, how much land there was, and what resources were available across England. So, in 1086, he commissioned a massive survey. The result was a detailed record of land, property, and resources. This record was so comprehensive and authoritative that it became known as the Domesday Book. The name reflects the finality of the information it contained, like the "Day of Judgement" or "Doomsday," from which there was no appeal. It was used to assess taxes and establish William's control. While the other books mentioned are real historical texts, they aren't related to William's survey. The Exeter and Vercelli Books, for example, are collections of Old English literature. The Domesday Book, however, is unique in its purpose as a comprehensive inventory of England under Norman rule.
