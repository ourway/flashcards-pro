Alright, let's delve into the era of William the Conqueror to understand why the Bayeux Tapestry and the Domesday Book are our key historical documents. William, a Norman duke, invaded England in 1066, famously winning the Battle of Hastings. To solidify his rule, he needed to understand and control his new kingdom. That's where the Domesday Book comes in. It was a comprehensive survey, completed in 1086, detailing who owned what land, how many people lived there, and what resources were available. Think of it as the ultimate property and tax record! Now, the Bayeux Tapestry is a different beast. It's a 230-foot-long embroidered cloth that visually narrates the events leading up to the Norman Conquest, including the Battle of Hastings itself. It's not exactly unbiased – it's Norman propaganda, really – but it provides invaluable insight into the Norman perspective and the visual culture of the time. While the Diary of Samuel Pepys is a fascinating read, it describes 17th-century England, centuries after William. The Magna Carta, a document limiting royal power, came about in 1215, during the reign of King John, also well after William's time. So, the Tapestry and the Domesday Book together paint a vivid picture of England under William I's rule.
