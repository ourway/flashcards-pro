Okay, let's talk about the start of World War II. In the 1930s, Germany, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, began aggressively expanding its territory. This was a direct violation of the Treaty of Versailles, which had been signed after World War I to prevent future conflicts. Hitler's ambition was to create a "Greater Germany," uniting all German-speaking people. He first annexed Austria in 1938, which was a relatively peaceful takeover. However, his sights were then set on Poland. Poland had a significant German-speaking population and, more importantly, access to the Baltic Sea through the Polish Corridor. On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland, using a tactic called "blitzkrieg," or "lightning war," which involved rapid, coordinated attacks by air and land. This invasion was the trigger that finally led Britain and France to declare war on Germany, marking the official beginning of World War II. So, while Germany had taken over Austria before, it was the invasion of Poland that sparked the global conflict.
