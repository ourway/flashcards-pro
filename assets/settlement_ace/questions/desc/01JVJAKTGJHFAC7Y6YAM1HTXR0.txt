St. Patrick's Day, celebrated annually on March 17th, is a cultural and religious holiday commemorating the patron saint of Ireland, Saint Patrick. He lived in the fifth century and is credited with bringing Christianity to Ireland. The day originally began as a religious feast day but has evolved into a global celebration of Irish culture. The date, March 17th, is believed to be the date of Saint Patrick's death. While some might confuse it with other holidays, like St. David's Day on March 1st (the patron saint of Wales) or St. George's Day on April 23rd (the patron saint of England), St. Patrick's Day is specifically and consistently observed on the 17th of March each year. It's a day filled with parades, traditional music, Irish dancing, and wearing green, all in honour of Irish heritage and Saint Patrick's legacy.
