Okay, let's unravel the story behind the First World War's beginning. The spark that ignited this global conflict was indeed the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo in June 1914. Now, it's easy to get confused with other wars, but the key here is the date. The assassination in 1914 directly triggered a chain reaction of diplomatic failures and military mobilizations across Europe. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, and due to a complex web of alliances, other major powers like Germany, France, and Russia were quickly drawn into the conflict. This escalation marked the beginning of the First World War, also known as the Great War at the time. The Second World War, of course, happened much later, starting in 1939. The Crimean War was a mid-19th-century conflict, and the Wars of the Roses were a series of English civil wars in the 15th century. So, while those were all significant conflicts, none were directly triggered by the events of 1914.
