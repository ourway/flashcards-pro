In Scotland, the legal system operates differently from England and Wales, so it's important to understand its unique structure. The Justice of the Peace Court is the court that deals with the majority of minor criminal offences. These offences can range from things like minor traffic violations to breaches of the peace. The court is presided over by a Justice of the Peace, who is a lay judge, or a legally qualified judge. The key thing to remember is that the Justice of the Peace Court is specifically designed to handle these less serious cases efficiently. Now, you might be tempted to think of a Magistrates' Court, but that's part of the legal system in England and Wales, not Scotland. So, when you think of minor criminal cases in Scotland, remember the Justice of the Peace Court as the first port of call.
