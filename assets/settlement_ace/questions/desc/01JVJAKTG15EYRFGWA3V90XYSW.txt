The Palace of Westminster, home to both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, is a place where the public can observe the workings of British democracy. The idea that only registered voters can witness debates in the House of Lords is incorrect. Public galleries exist in both houses of Parliament precisely to allow anyone, regardless of their voting status, to watch debates. Think of these galleries as a window into the democratic process. Historically, this access has been considered vital for transparency and accountability. While there might be security checks and capacity limits, being on the electoral register isn't a requirement for entry to the public galleries. It's a common misconception that everything in Parliament is restricted to voters, but the public galleries are specifically designed to be open to all.
