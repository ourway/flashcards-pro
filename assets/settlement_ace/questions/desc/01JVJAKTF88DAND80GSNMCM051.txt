The BBC, or British Broadcasting Corporation, is unique in its funding model. Unlike commercial television channels that rely on advertising revenue, the BBC is primarily funded by a television licence fee. This fee is paid by households that watch or record live TV programmes, regardless of the channel. The idea behind this system, established in 1922, is to ensure the BBC's independence from commercial pressures and political influence, allowing it to focus on providing high-quality, unbiased programming. This means you won't see adverts interrupting your favourite shows on BBC channels. The licence fee model has been debated over the years, but it remains the core of the BBC's funding, ensuring a wide range of programming from news and documentaries to drama and children's shows, without the need to sell advertising space. So, the statement that the BBC is funded through the sale of advertising space is false.
