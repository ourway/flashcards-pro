Alright, let's talk about Iron Age defenses. The Iron Age in Britain, which lasted roughly from 800 BC to the Roman invasion in 43 AD, was a time of significant social and political change. People lived in tribal groups and were often at odds with each other, competing for resources and territory. This constant threat of conflict led to the development of sophisticated defensive structures, and that's where hill forts come in. These weren't just any old settlements; they were strategically built fortifications, usually located on elevated ground like hills or ridges. The high vantage point gave the inhabitants a clear view of the surrounding landscape, allowing them to spot approaching enemies from a distance. They were typically enclosed by ditches, ramparts, and sometimes wooden palisades, making them difficult to attack. So, when you think of Iron Age defenses, picture these imposing hill forts dominating the landscape â€“ they were the go-to defensive structure of the time. Skara Brae, on the other hand, is a Neolithic village, much older than the Iron Age. Barrows, both round and hill, are burial mounds, not defensive structures.
