The UK's involvement in Iraq followed the 2003 invasion as part of a multinational coalition. While the initial invasion aimed to remove Saddam Hussein from power, British troops remained in Iraq for several years afterward, primarily focused on maintaining security and training Iraqi forces. It's important to remember that the situation in Iraq was complex and evolved over time. Although combat operations decreased significantly earlier, British troops didn't fully withdraw until 2009. This withdrawal marked the end of Operation Telic, the UK's military operation in Iraq. While some personnel remained for training purposes, the main body of troops returned home in 2009, making it the correct answer. The other dates are incorrect because they either predate the main period of British involvement or are after the official withdrawal date.
