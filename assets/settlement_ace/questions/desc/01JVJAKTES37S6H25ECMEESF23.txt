Bank Holidays are a unique part of the UK's calendar, and the name itself gives you a big clue! The term specifically refers to public holidays in the United Kingdom when banks and many other businesses are closed. The concept originated with the Bank Holidays Act of 1871, introduced by Sir John Lubbock, a banker and politician. Before this act, the only official holidays were religious ones like Christmas Day and Good Friday. Lubbock wanted to create more days off for the working population, and he initially proposed four bank holidays. The Act established these days, and the name "Bank Holiday" stuck because the closure of banks was a very visible sign that it was a day off for many. While other businesses might also close, the banks are the key element in the name. So, while "Business Holidays" might sound plausible, the specific and historically accurate term is "Bank Holidays" because they were originally tied to the closure of banks.
