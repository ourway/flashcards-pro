Formula 1 racing is a global motorsport with a huge following, and Britain has played a massive role in its history and continued success. The sport itself involves single-seater, open-wheel racing cars competing on purpose-built circuits and public roads. Think of iconic tracks like Silverstone in Northamptonshire, which hosted the first-ever Formula 1 World Championship race in 1950! Britain has produced some of the most successful and celebrated Formula 1 drivers in the sport's history. Lewis Hamilton, with his record-equalling seven World Championships, is perhaps the most famous contemporary example. But before him, you had figures like Jensen Button, who won the World Championship in 2009, and Damon Hill, who took the title in 1996 â€“ his father Graham Hill was also a multiple champion! So, when you think of British sporting heroes in fast cars, Formula 1 is definitely the sport that springs to mind. Football, athletics, and skiing are all popular in the UK, but they aren't specifically connected to these particular racing personalities.
