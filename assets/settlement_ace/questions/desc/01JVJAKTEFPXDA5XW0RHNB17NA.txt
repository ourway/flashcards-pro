St. Andrew's Day, celebrated on November 30th, is Scotland's official national day. Saint Andrew is the patron saint of Scotland, and his connection to the country goes way back. Legend has it that some of his relics were brought to Scotland in the 4th century, making him a figure of national importance for centuries. November 30th isn't just a random date; it's believed to be the day Saint Andrew was crucified. While celebrations weren't always widespread, St. Andrew's Day has seen a resurgence in popularity, especially since becoming a bank holiday in 2006. It's a time to celebrate Scottish culture with traditional food, music, and dance. The other dates listed are associated with other patron saints: March 1st is St. David's Day (Wales), April 23rd is St. George's Day (England), and March 17th is St. Patrick's Day (Ireland). So, if you're thinking about Scottish heritage, remember St. Andrew's Day falls at the end of November.
