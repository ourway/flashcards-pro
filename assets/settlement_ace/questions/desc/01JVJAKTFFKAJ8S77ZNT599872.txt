Okay, let's talk about Northern Ireland's capital. Northern Ireland is one of the four countries that make up the United Kingdom, along with England, Scotland, and Wales. Each of these countries has its own capital city, and it's important to know them for the Life in the UK test. Now, when we think about Northern Ireland, we need to remember its largest city, which is Belfast. Belfast has a rich history, particularly in shipbuilding â€“ the Titanic was built there! It's also a major economic and cultural hub for Northern Ireland. Because of its size, historical importance, and role as the seat of Northern Ireland's government, Belfast is the capital. The other options, Cardiff, Edinburgh, and London, are the capitals of Wales, Scotland, and England respectively, so while they are important UK capitals, they don't apply to Northern Ireland.
