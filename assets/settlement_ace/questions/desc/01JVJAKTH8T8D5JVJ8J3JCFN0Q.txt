Horse racing is a popular pastime in the UK, steeped in history and tradition. Royal Ascot, held in Berkshire, is a highlight of the British social calendar, dating back to 1711 when Queen Anne founded the racecourse. It's known for its strict dress code and association with the Royal Family, who attend each day. The Grand National, on the other hand, is a steeplechase held annually at Aintree Racecourse near Liverpool since 1839. It's famous for its challenging fences, like Becher's Brook, and is considered one of the most difficult horse races in the world. So, Royal Ascot and the Grand National are the two renowned horse-racing events. The Six Nations is a rugby tournament, and The Cup Final usually refers to the FA Cup in football, so while they are major sporting events, they aren't related to horse racing.
