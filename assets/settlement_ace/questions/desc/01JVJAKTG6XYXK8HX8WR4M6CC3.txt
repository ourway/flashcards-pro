The Red Cross is a globally recognised humanitarian organisation dedicated to helping people in crisis, regardless of their nationality, religion, or political beliefs. It was founded in the late 19th century, inspired by the horrors witnessed during the Crimean War. The organisation's symbol, a red cross on a white background, is internationally protected and signifies neutrality and aid. The British Red Cross is the UK branch of this international movement. It provides a range of services, from disaster relief and first aid training to supporting vulnerable people in local communities. While Age UK is a fantastic charity focused on supporting older people in the UK, and the National Trust works to preserve historical sites and natural landscapes, neither are part of the international Red Cross network. The key is recognising the Red Cross as a global entity with branches in different countries, including the British Red Cross.
