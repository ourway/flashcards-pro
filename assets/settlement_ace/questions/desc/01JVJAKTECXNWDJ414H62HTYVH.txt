William Shakespeare, often called the Bard of Avon, lived from 1564 to 1616 and is considered the greatest writer in the English language. His plays and sonnets are studied worldwide, but his impact extends far beyond literature classrooms. Shakespeare didn't just write beautifully; he actively shaped the English language. He's credited with inventing or popularizing thousands of words and phrases that we still use today. Think about words like "eyeball," "swagger," "bedroom," or phrases like "break the ice" and "heart of gold." These all have their roots in Shakespeare's works. While Edward Thomas, William Blake, and Wilfred Owen were all talented poets, their contributions to the English language don't compare to Shakespeare's extensive and lasting influence. Shakespeare's linguistic creativity is a key reason why he remains so relevant and celebrated centuries after his death.
