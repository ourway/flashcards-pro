The River Thames is central to London's history and identity. For centuries, it served as the city's main thoroughfare for trade and transportation, shaping its growth and development. Many of London's most famous landmarks are situated along its banks, including the Houses of Parliament, Tower Bridge, and the Tower of London. The London Eye, a giant Ferris wheel offering panoramic views of the city, was built on the South Bank of the Thames in 1999 to mark the millennium. Its location on the riverbank is integral to the experience, providing stunning vistas of the waterway and the surrounding cityscape. The other options, the Tyburn, Walbrook, and Fleet, are all rivers that exist or existed in London, but they are smaller and less prominent. The Tyburn is now mostly underground, the Walbrook is a subterranean river, and the Fleet is a hidden river. None of them flow near the London Eye.
