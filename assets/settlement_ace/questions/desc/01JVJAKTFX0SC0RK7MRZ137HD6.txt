Okay, let's talk about Charles II and his rather interesting journey back to the English throne. After his father, Charles I, was executed in 1649, England became a republic under Oliver Cromwell. However, this didn't last forever. When Cromwell died in 1658, things started to fall apart. People were tired of the strict Puritan rule. So, leading figures in Parliament decided to restore the monarchy. Now, Charles II had been in exile since his father's execution, and he spent a significant portion of that time in the Netherlands. The Netherlands, at the time, was a relatively tolerant and stable place, offering him refuge. So, it was from the Netherlands that Parliament extended the invitation for him to return and take the throne in 1660, marking the Restoration of the monarchy. While he might have had connections or spent time in other European countries, the Netherlands was his primary base of operations during his exile, making it the country from which he was officially invited back.
