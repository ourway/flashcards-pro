The story of Boudicca and the Iceni is a powerful one from Roman Britain, around 60 AD. The Romans had invaded Britain about a century earlier, and while some tribes cooperated, others resisted. The Iceni were one of these tribes, located in what we now know as Eastern England, specifically in the area of modern-day Norfolk. When Boudicca's husband, the Iceni king, died, the Romans tried to seize their lands and wealth, leading to Boudicca's famous revolt. She led a massive uprising against the Romans, burning cities like Colchester and London to the ground. Although the rebellion was eventually crushed, Boudicca became a symbol of British resistance against foreign rule. So, when you think of Boudicca and the Iceni, picture the flatlands and coastline of Eastern England â€“ that's where they called home and launched their rebellion. It's easy to get confused with other regions, but the archaeological evidence and historical accounts firmly place the Iceni in the East.
