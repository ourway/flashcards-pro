The United Nations was formed in 1945, right after the devastation of World War II. Think of it as a global club created specifically to stop history from repeating itself. The main goal was to create a forum where countries could talk through their problems instead of resorting to armed conflict. The UN Charter, its founding document, emphasizes maintaining international peace and security above all else. While the UN does work on many other important issues like promoting human rights, sustainable development, and providing humanitarian aid, its core purpose, the reason it was established in the first place, is to prevent wars and keep the peace. So, while democracy and development are important shared goals, they are secondary to the UN's primary, overriding objective of preventing war and promoting international peace and security.
