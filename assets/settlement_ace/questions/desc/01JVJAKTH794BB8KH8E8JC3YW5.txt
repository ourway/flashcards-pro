Father's Day is a celebration honoring fathers and fatherhood, and while it's a widely observed tradition in the UK, the timing is key. It's not on the second Sunday of June, as the question suggests. Instead, Father's Day is celebrated on the *third* Sunday of June. This date is consistent across the UK and many other countries. The tradition of giving cards and gifts to fathers on this day is certainly true, reflecting the sentiment of appreciation and love. You might be tempted to think it's the second Sunday because Mother's Day, which is celebrated in March, does fall on a Sunday and the date changes each year. However, Father's Day has a fixed position relative to the month of June, always being the third Sunday. So, while the sentiment described in the question is accurate, the specific timing is incorrect, making the statement false.
