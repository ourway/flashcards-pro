The role of the Speaker in the House of Commons is a really interesting one because it blends being a Member of Parliament with a duty of complete impartiality. Think of the Speaker as the referee in a lively football match â€“ they need to know the game inside and out, but they can't be seen to favour one team over another. The Speaker is indeed an elected MP, just like all the others, representing a specific constituency and initially affiliated with a political party. However, upon election as Speaker, they must resign from their party affiliation to maintain neutrality. This is a crucial aspect of the UK parliamentary system, ensuring fair debates and proceedings. While the Speaker continues to serve their constituents, addressing their concerns just like any other MP, their primary responsibility shifts to managing parliamentary business and upholding the rules of the House. So, even though they're still an MP, their role is fundamentally different, demanding impartiality above all else. This is why the statement is true.
