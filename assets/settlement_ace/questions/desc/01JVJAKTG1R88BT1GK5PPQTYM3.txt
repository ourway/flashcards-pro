The House of Commons, the elected chamber of the UK Parliament, needs someone to maintain order and guide debates. That person is called the Speaker. Think of them as the referee in a very important game! The Speaker's role dates back centuries, with the first officially recorded Speaker being Sir Thomas Hungerford in 1377. Their job is to be impartial, meaning they don't take sides or express their own opinions on the topics being discussed. They ensure all Members of Parliament get a fair chance to speak and that the rules of the House are followed. While the Prime Minister is the head of the government and the Leader of the House manages government business in Parliament, neither of them are responsible for chairing debates. The Speaker is the ultimate authority on procedure in the Commons chamber.
