Okay, let's talk about women's suffrage in the UK. The fight for women's right to vote was a long and hard-won battle, spanning decades. Initially, only men who owned property could vote, and women were entirely excluded. The suffragette movement, led by figures like Emmeline Pankhurst, used increasingly radical tactics in the early 20th century to demand change. World War I actually played a significant role in shifting public opinion. Women stepped into traditionally male roles while men were at war, proving their capabilities and contributing significantly to the war effort. As a result, in 1918, women over the age of 30 who met certain property qualifications were granted the right to vote. It wasn't full equality just yet, as men could vote from age 21. Finally, in 1928, the Representation of the People Act lowered the voting age for women to 21, the same as men. This act finally achieved equal voting rights, marking a huge milestone in British social and political history. So, the statement is true because 1928 was the year that women finally gained the right to vote at the same age as men.
