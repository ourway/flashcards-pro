The Queen's Speech is a key part of the UK's parliamentary process, marking the formal start of the parliamentary year. Think of it as the government laying out its plans for the next 12 months. The government, led by the Prime Minister, decides what new laws and policies they want to introduce. The speech itself is delivered by the monarch, but it's written by the government. So, while the Queen reads it, she's essentially acting as a messenger, presenting the government's agenda to Parliament and the nation. It's not a review of past policies or a motivational talk; it's a forward-looking statement of intent. The speech is followed by a debate in Parliament, where MPs discuss and scrutinize the government's proposals. This whole process is steeped in tradition, highlighting the relationship between the Crown, the government, and Parliament.
