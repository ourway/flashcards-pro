George Frederick Handel, though a significant figure in British musical history, wasn't actually born in Britain. He was born in Germany in 1685, in a town called Halle. He started his musical career there, learning to play the organ and composing early works. The reason Germany is the correct answer is because it represents Handel's origins and early musical development. He later moved to England in 1712 and became a naturalized British subject in 1727. It was in Britain that he composed some of his most famous works, like "Messiah," and became a celebrated composer. However, his birthplace remained Germany. While Iceland, Russia, and Japan have rich musical traditions, they have no direct connection to Handel's birth or early life. So, remembering that Handel's journey began in Germany is key to answering this question correctly.
