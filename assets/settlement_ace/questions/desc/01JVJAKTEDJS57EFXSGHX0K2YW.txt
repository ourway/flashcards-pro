When the Anglo-Saxons began arriving in Britain around the 5th century AD, they weren't Christians. They followed a pagan belief system with gods and goddesses similar to those in Norse mythology. Think of gods like Woden, after whom Wednesday is named, or Thor, the god of thunder. Christianity was already present in Britain, having been introduced during the Roman period, but it was largely pushed to the fringes, particularly to the west in areas like Wales and Cornwall, by the incoming Anglo-Saxons. The conversion of the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity was a gradual process that took place over the next few centuries. Missionaries, most famously St. Augustine, who arrived in Kent in 597 AD, played a key role in converting Anglo-Saxon kings and their people. So, while Christianity eventually became dominant, it's important to remember that the initial Anglo-Saxon settlers were not Christian upon arrival.
