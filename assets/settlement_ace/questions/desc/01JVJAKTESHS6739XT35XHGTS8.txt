Alright, let's talk about those early invaders of Britain: the Jutes, Angles, and Saxons. To understand where they came from, we need to look at the map of Europe. These tribes originated from the northern part of the continent, specifically areas that today roughly correspond to Denmark, northern Germany, and the Netherlands. Now, you might be thinking, "Why not Western Europe?" Well, while the Netherlands is technically in Western Europe, the Angles and Saxons pushed westward from areas further north and east. The Jutes are believed to have come from the Jutland peninsula, which makes up mainland Denmark. So, while Western Europe isn't entirely wrong, Northern Europe is the more accurate and encompassing answer. Southern Europe is definitely incorrect, as that's the Mediterranean region, and Eastern Europe was populated by different groups at this time. These Northern European tribes had a massive impact on Britain, shaping its language, culture, and even its name â€“ "Angle-land" eventually became England!
