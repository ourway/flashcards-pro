Okay, let's talk about the history of automobile racing in the UK. The late 19th century saw the invention of the motor car, and naturally, people soon wanted to test their speed and engineering skills against each other. However, early racing was hampered by legal restrictions and public concerns about safety. It wasn't until the dawn of the 20th century that things really started to pick up. While there were some very early attempts at racing before, 1902 is the key year because it marks the first officially recognised automobile race in Britain. This event took place at Bexhill-on-Sea, a coastal town in East Sussex. So, while you might think of earlier dates because cars existed, 1902 is the correct answer because it represents the start of formal, organised racing events in the UK. The other dates are either too early, before organised racing was really possible, or too late, missing the initial boom in motorsport.
