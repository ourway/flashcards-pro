The 20th century saw incredible technological advancements, and two British figures stand out for their revolutionary contributions. Alan Turing was a brilliant mathematician and computer scientist, pivotal in cracking the German Enigma code during World War II. His work at Bletchley Park is credited with significantly shortening the war, saving countless lives. Beyond his wartime contributions, Turing laid the theoretical foundations for modern computing and artificial intelligence. Then there's Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. In 1989, while working at CERN, he developed the technology that allows us to access and share information globally via the internet. His invention of HTML, HTTP, and URLs are the backbone of the web as we know it. While Isambard Kingdom Brunel and John Logie Baird were also significant British inventors, Brunel's achievements were primarily in the 19th century with railways and ships, and Baird, while important for early television, doesn't have the same global impact as Turing's computing concepts and Berners-Lee's internet.
