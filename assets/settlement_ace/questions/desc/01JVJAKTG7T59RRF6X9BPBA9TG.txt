When you need to resolve a dispute involving a relatively small amount of money, the UK legal system offers a streamlined process called the "small claims track." This is designed to be more accessible and less intimidating than going to a higher court. The County Court is where these small claims are typically handled. Think of it as the local hub for resolving these kinds of issues. County Courts are located throughout the UK, making them the most accessible point of contact for information and procedures related to small claims. While council offices deal with local government matters, polling stations are for elections, and the High Court handles much more complex and high-value cases, the County Court is specifically geared towards assisting individuals with navigating the small claims process. They can provide guidance on filing claims, court procedures, and what to expect during the process.
