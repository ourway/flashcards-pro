Okay, let's talk about the Hundred Years War. This wasn't just a quick skirmish; it was a really long and complicated series of conflicts between England and France, lasting from 1337 to 1453. So, while the name is a bit of a simplification, it gives you a good idea of the scale. Think of it as a clash of kingdoms, driven by disputes over land, the French throne, and general power struggles. Figures like Edward III and Henry V of England, and Joan of Arc on the French side, became legendary during this time. Battles like Cr√©cy and Agincourt are still famous today. The war ultimately reshaped both England and France, contributing to the development of distinct national identities. The other options were important battles, but they were single events, not extended wars. The Battle of Trafalgar was a key naval battle against Napoleon, Bannockburn was a Scottish victory against England, and the Battle of the Boyne was fought in Ireland. So, while significant, none of them were a century-long war between Britain and France.
