The Turner Prize is all about celebrating new and sometimes controversial art, but it's been around longer than you might think. It wasn't established in 2004. Instead, it was launched way back in 1984. Think of 1984 as a year of innovation â€“ the same year Apple launched its Macintosh computer! The Turner Prize was created to stimulate discussion around contemporary art and bring it to a wider audience. It's named after the famous English painter J.M.W. Turner, known for his innovative and sometimes radical landscape paintings. The prize is awarded annually to a British artist under 50 for an outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work. So, while 2004 might seem like a reasonable guess for a modern art prize, it's actually been around for two decades longer, making the statement false.
