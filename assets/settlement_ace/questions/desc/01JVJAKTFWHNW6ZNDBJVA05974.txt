Okay, let's talk about why "Poems" is the right category for Beowulf, The Tyger, and She Walks in Beauty. Think about what makes a poem a poem. It's all about carefully chosen words, rhythm, and often rhyme, used to express emotions, tell a story, or paint a picture in your mind. "Beowulf" is a classic example, although it's an epic poem, meaning it's a long narrative poem that tells the story of a hero. It was originally written in Old English, dating back to the Anglo-Saxon period, so it's one of the earliest and most important works in English literature. "The Tyger" and "She Walks in Beauty" are shorter, more lyrical poems. "The Tyger" was written by William Blake, a famous Romantic poet, and it's known for its powerful imagery and deep questions about creation. "She Walks in Beauty" is by Lord Byron, another Romantic poet, and it's a beautiful description of a woman's grace and inner beauty. While all three works are very different, they are all written in verse and use poetic devices, which makes them poems. They aren't plays because they aren't written to be performed on stage with actors and dialogue. They aren't novels because they aren't long, fictional prose narratives. And they definitely aren't movies, which are a much more recent form of storytelling!
