The discovery of the DNA structure is a landmark achievement in science, and it's deeply connected to British researchers. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick, working at the University of Cambridge, published their groundbreaking paper outlining the double helix structure of DNA. This discovery revolutionized biology and medicine, providing the foundation for understanding genetics and heredity. While Watson was American, Crick was British, and the research was conducted in Britain, making it a British scientific achievement. The other options, while inventions, aren't quite as strongly linked to British innovation. The radiator was developed in the late 19th century, with contributions from both American and European inventors. The hovercraft was invented by Briton Christopher Cockerell, but the question asks for a discovery, not an invention. The fire extinguisher has a more complex history with various inventors across different countries. So, while those are interesting technologies, the DNA structure discovery stands out as a pivotal scientific breakthrough with strong British roots.
