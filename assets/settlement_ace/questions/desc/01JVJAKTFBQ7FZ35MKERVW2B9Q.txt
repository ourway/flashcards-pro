Okay, so a general election doesn't happen every time a Member of Parliament, or MP, dies or resigns. Think of it this way: a general election is a big national event where the *entire* country votes for *all* the MPs in the House of Commons. It's held at least every five years, but can be called earlier. Now, when an MP leaves their position mid-term, whether it's because they've passed away or decided to step down, we don't redo the whole general election. Instead, we hold what's called a "by-election" in that specific MP's constituency. Only the people living in that area get to vote for a new MP to represent them. So, while it's true that a new election happens when an MP leaves, it's a much smaller, localized event, not a full-blown general election. It's easy to get confused because both involve voting, but the scale and purpose are very different.
