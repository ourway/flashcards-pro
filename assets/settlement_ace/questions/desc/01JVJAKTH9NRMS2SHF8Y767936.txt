The British Empire was truly vast, reaching its largest extent in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Think about Queen Victoria's reign â€“ that's when Britain's influence was at its absolute peak. The Empire included territories all over the globe, from Canada and India to Australia and parts of Africa. Because of this massive reach, it governed a huge number of people. While it's easy to underestimate, the population under British rule at its height was approximately 400 million people. The other answer options might sound plausible, but they fall short of the actual scale of the Empire. It's a number that really highlights the sheer size and power Britain once held on the world stage.
