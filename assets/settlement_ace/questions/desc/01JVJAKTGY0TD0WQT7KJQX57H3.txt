Valentine's Day, celebrated annually on February 14th, is a day dedicated to expressing affection and love. Its origins are a bit murky, with some linking it to ancient Roman festivals like Lupercalia, which celebrated fertility. However, the Valentine's Day we know today is more closely tied to St. Valentine, a Roman priest who was martyred in the 3rd century AD. Legend says he performed secret marriages for young lovers against the wishes of the emperor. By the Middle Ages, St. Valentine became associated with romantic love, and the tradition of exchanging cards and gifts began to take shape. So, February 14th is specifically set aside each year to celebrate love and relationships. The other options are celebrated on different dates: Bonfire Night on November 5th, Halloween on October 31st, and Hogmanay on December 31st/January 1st.
