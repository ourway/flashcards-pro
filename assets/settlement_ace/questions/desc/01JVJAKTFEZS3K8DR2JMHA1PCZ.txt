Gilbert and Sullivan were a famous Victorian-era duo known for their comic operas, which were incredibly popular in Britain and beyond. William Gilbert wrote the librettos, which are the words, and Arthur Sullivan composed the music. Their works are characterized by clever wordplay, satirical storylines, and catchy melodies. "HMS Pinafore," a story about love across social classes on a ship, and "The Mikado," set in Japan (though really a satire of British society), are two of their most celebrated creations. They represent the quintessential Gilbert and Sullivan style. The other options, "The Phantom of the Opera," "Jesus Christ Superstar," and "Tim Rice and Evita" are all much later works, belonging to the genre of musical theatre, not comic opera. Andrew Lloyd Webber composed "The Phantom of the Opera" and "Jesus Christ Superstar," while Tim Rice wrote the lyrics for "Evita," with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber. These are all significant works, but they are distinct from the Gilbert and Sullivan tradition.
