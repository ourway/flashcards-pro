Okay, let's talk about how income tax usually works in the UK. The system is designed to be pretty efficient, and for most employed people, it operates through something called PAYE, which stands for "Pay As You Earn." Think of it this way: the government wants to collect taxes regularly, rather than waiting for one big payment at the end of the year. So, your employer acts as a middleman. Before your salary even hits your bank account, your employer calculates how much income tax and National Insurance you owe based on your earnings and your tax code. They then deduct this amount and send it directly to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), which is the UK's tax authority. This means the income tax of most people is automatically deducted from the income from employment by their employer. While you *can* pay some taxes through direct debit from your bank account, that's usually for things like self-assessment if you're self-employed or have other income sources. For the majority of employees, PAYE handles it all seamlessly behind the scenes.
