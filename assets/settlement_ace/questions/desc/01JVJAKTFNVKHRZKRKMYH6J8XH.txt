November 5th is all about Guy Fawkes Night, also known as Bonfire Night. This tradition stems from a real historical event: the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. A group of Catholics, including Guy Fawkes, planned to blow up the Houses of Parliament in London and assassinate King James I. They were unhappy with the King's policies towards Catholics. The plot was discovered on November 5th, when Guy Fawkes was found guarding explosives in the cellars beneath Parliament. He was arrested, and the plot was foiled. Ever since, people in Britain have celebrated the failure of the Gunpowder Plot with bonfires, fireworks, and the burning of effigies of Guy Fawkes. While the end of both World Wars are significant historical events, they are commemorated on different dates, specifically November 11th for World War I and May 8th for World War II. The defeat of the Spanish Armada was a major naval victory, but it happened much earlier, in 1588, and is not specifically remembered on November 5th.
