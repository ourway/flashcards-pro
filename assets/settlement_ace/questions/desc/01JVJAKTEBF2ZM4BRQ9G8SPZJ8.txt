Okay, let's break down the driving license age question. It's a common misconception that you can drive on the same license right up until you're 75. Actually, in the UK, once you reach the age of 70, your driving license automatically expires. This doesn't mean you have to stop driving, though! Instead, you need to renew your license. The renewal process involves declaring that you're still fit to drive, meeting the eyesight requirements, and haven't been disqualified from driving for any reason. You then need to renew it every three years after that. The reason for this is to ensure that older drivers are still safe on the road, as eyesight and reaction times can naturally decline with age. So, while you *can* continue driving past 70, it's not automatic; you have to take active steps to renew your license and confirm your fitness to drive.
