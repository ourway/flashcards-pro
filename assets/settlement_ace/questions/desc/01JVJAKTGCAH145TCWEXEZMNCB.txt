The late 19th century was a period of incredible technological advancement, and one of the most exciting new inventions was the cinematograph, which allowed moving images to be projected onto a screen. While the very first public film screening took place in Paris in 1895, it wasn't long before this new form of entertainment made its way across the Channel. Public film screenings in the UK officially began in 1896. This was a pivotal moment, marking the birth of cinema as a popular pastime and laying the foundation for the British film industry we know today. While 1906, 1914, and 1945 are all significant years in cinematic history, they came later in the development of film. 1906 saw the opening of the first permanent cinema in the UK. 1914 was the start of the First World War, which had a big impact on film production. 1945, of course, marked the end of the Second World War, and a new era for British cinema. But 1896 is the year that the magic of moving pictures first captivated British audiences in a public setting.
