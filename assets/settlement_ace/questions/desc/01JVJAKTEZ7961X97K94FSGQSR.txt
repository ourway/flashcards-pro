The UK operates under a system where the public elects Members of Parliament (MPs) to represent them in the House of Commons. This is the core of a parliamentary democracy. Unlike a dictatorship, power isn't held by a single person or a small group. Instead, it's distributed through elected officials who are accountable to the people. The UK isn't a federal government like the United States or Germany, where power is divided between a central authority and regional entities; while Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have devolved powers, ultimate authority rests with the UK Parliament. And of course, the UK is definitely not a communist government, which is characterized by state control of the economy and a one-party political system. The UK's system, developed over centuries, ensures that the government is formed by the party that can command the confidence of the House of Commons, making it a parliamentary democracy.
