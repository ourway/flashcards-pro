Cricket's roots are firmly planted in England, dating back as far as the 16th century. While the exact origins are debated, most historians agree that it evolved from earlier bat-and-ball games played in the southeast of England. By the 18th century, cricket had become a popular national sport, with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) established in 1787, becoming the guardian of the laws of the game. The spread of cricket to other countries, like Australia and India, occurred through the British Empire. British colonists and traders introduced the sport to these regions, where it was quickly embraced and adapted. So, while cricket is hugely popular in places like India and Australia today, and Scotland has its own sporting history, the sport itself originated and was formally developed in England. Thinking of those quintessential English village greens and the long history of the sport there should help you remember!
