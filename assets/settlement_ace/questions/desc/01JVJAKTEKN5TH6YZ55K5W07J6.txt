The Battle of Trafalgar, a pivotal naval engagement in British history, took place in 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars. It was a clash between the British Royal Navy, led by Admiral Horatio Nelson, and the combined fleets of France and Spain. Napoleon Bonaparte, the French Emperor, aimed to invade Britain, and controlling the seas was crucial for this plan. The battle occurred off the coast of Spain, near Cape Trafalgar. Nelson's innovative tactics led to a decisive British victory, crippling the French and Spanish navies and securing British naval dominance for over a century. Nelson himself was fatally wounded during the battle, becoming a national hero. So, the statement that Nelson defeated the German fleet is incorrect because Germany didn't even exist as a unified nation at that time; it was the French and Spanish fleets he faced. Remembering "France and Spain felt Nelson's pain" can help you recall the correct alliance.
