The National Trust is all about protecting Britain's heritage. Think of it as the nation's caretaker for historically significant places. It was founded in 1895, a time when there was growing concern about the loss of open spaces and historic buildings due to industrialisation and development. The founders, Octavia Hill, Sir Robert Hunter, and Hardwicke Rawnsley, wanted to ensure that everyone could enjoy these places for generations to come. So, the Trust's core mission became preserving important buildings and places, from grand stately homes and castles to beautiful gardens, coastlines, and areas of countryside. While they might contribute to environmental efforts, their main focus is on the built and natural heritage. It's not specifically about birds, planes, or fish, but about the buildings and landscapes that tell Britain's story.
