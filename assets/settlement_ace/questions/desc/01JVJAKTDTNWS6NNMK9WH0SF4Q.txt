London is a massive, sprawling metropolis, and to manage it effectively, it's divided into smaller administrative areas. These are called local authorities, and they're responsible for things like schools, social services, waste collection, and local planning. Think of them as mini-governments within the larger city. Now, the number of these authorities might surprise you. It's not a small number like 15 or 21, which would be far too few to handle the needs of such a large population. And while 45 might seem plausible, it's actually an overestimate. The correct number is 33. This includes the 32 London boroughs and the City of London, which is a separate entity with its own unique governance. So, remembering that London has 33 local authorities helps you understand how this huge city is managed at a local level.
