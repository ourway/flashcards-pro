The Victorian era was a time of incredible innovation and industrial progress in Britain, and the Great Exhibition of 1851 was designed to showcase all of that. Think of it as the world's first world's fair! To house this massive exhibition, they needed a building unlike anything seen before. That's where the Crystal Palace comes in. It was a revolutionary structure made primarily of cast iron and plate glass, a testament to Britain's industrial capabilities. It was originally built in Hyde Park, but later moved to Sydenham. The Palace of Westminster, on the other hand, is the home of Parliament and a much older building with a very different architectural style. Kensington Palace has its own rich history as a royal residence, but it wasn't built for the Great Exhibition. And the Dream Palace? That's not a real place! So, the Crystal Palace is the only answer that fits the description of a structure built for the Great Exhibition using those innovative materials.
