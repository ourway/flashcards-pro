The River Thames is absolutely central to London's story. It's been a vital waterway for trade and transport since Roman times, when London was founded as Londinium on its banks. Think of all the historical events that have unfolded along the Thames: royal processions, naval battles, the arrival of goods from across the globe. Even today, it's a major shipping route. Now, the London Eye, that giant Ferris wheel offering amazing views of the city, was deliberately placed on the south bank of the Thames. This location allows riders to see iconic landmarks like the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, and St. Paul's Cathedral, all of which are closely linked to the river. The other rivers listed, the Tyburn and Walbrook, are smaller rivers that are now mostly underground in London, and the Clyde is a major river in Scotland, so they wouldn't be relevant to the London Eye's location.
