Farming didn't just pop up in Britain out of nowhere; it was brought over by people migrating from other places. Think back to the history of agriculture itself. Farming first developed in the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East and then gradually spread across Europe. The ancestors of Britain's first farmers came from South-East Europe, specifically the area around modern-day Greece and the Balkans. These people were already practicing agriculture, cultivating crops like wheat and barley, and raising animals like sheep and goats. Around 6,000 years ago, they began migrating westward, bringing their knowledge and skills with them. So, while it might be tempting to think that farming originated closer to Britain, like in North-West Europe, the archaeological evidence clearly shows that the initial wave of farmers came from much further south and east. They sailed or walked to Britain, introducing a completely new way of life.
