The concept of the rule of law is absolutely fundamental to understanding British society. It essentially means that everyone, including the government, is subject to and accountable under the law. No one is above it. This principle developed over centuries, with key milestones like the Magna Carta in 1215, which limited the power of the monarch and established the idea that even the king was subject to the law. Over time, this evolved into a system where laws are created through Parliament and applied fairly and consistently by the courts. So, while historically the upper classes held significant power, and MPs certainly play a role in creating laws, the overarching principle is that everyone is bound by the same legal framework. Even though the monarch is the head of state, they act within the constraints of the law. The rule of law ensures fairness, stability, and predictability in society, preventing arbitrary power and protecting individual rights. Without it, you'd have chaos and injustice!
