Wales has a rich cultural heritage, and a key part of that is its patron saint, St David. He lived in the 6th century and is a really important figure in Welsh Christianity. He founded a monastic settlement in what is now St Davids in Pembrokeshire, which became a significant religious centre. St David was known for his simple lifestyle and his teachings emphasized things like abstinence and helping others. He died on March 1st, which is now celebrated as St David's Day, the national day of Wales. So, while St Andrew is the patron saint of Scotland, St Patrick of Ireland, and St George of England, it's St David who holds that special place in the hearts of the Welsh people. Remembering that connection between 'Wales' and 'David' through the shared 'a' can be a handy trick to recall the correct answer.
