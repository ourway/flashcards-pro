The Paralympic Games are an international multi-sport event involving athletes with a range of disabilities. They run alongside the Olympic Games. To understand this question, it's helpful to know some of the UK's most celebrated Paralympians. Ellie Simmonds is a fantastic example. She's a swimmer who competed in four Paralympic Games, winning multiple gold medals and becoming a household name. David Weir is another iconic figure. He's a wheelchair racer, also with numerous Paralympic gold medals to his name, particularly excelling in marathon events. Both have made significant contributions to raising the profile of Paralympic sports in the UK. While Jessica Ennis-Hill is a celebrated Olympic track and field athlete, and Andy Murray is a tennis star, neither are primarily known for their involvement or achievements in Paralympic sports. Therefore, Ellie Simmonds and David Weir are the correct answer because they are both renowned for their outstanding achievements specifically within the Paralympic Games.
