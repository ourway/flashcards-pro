Sherlock Holmes is one of the most iconic literary characters ever created, and his stories have shaped detective fiction as we know it. The man behind this brilliant detective and his adventures is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Born in Edinburgh in 1859, Doyle wasn't just a writer; he was also a physician. In fact, he initially struggled to gain literary recognition and continued practicing medicine alongside his writing. It was in 1887 that he introduced Sherlock Holmes to the world in "A Study in Scarlet," and the rest, as they say, is history. Doyle penned four novels and 56 short stories featuring Holmes and his loyal companion, Dr. Watson, captivating readers with their intricate plots and Holmes's unparalleled deductive reasoning. While Evelyn Waugh, Kingsley Amis, and Graham Greene were all accomplished British authors, they are known for different genres and styles of writing. Waugh is famous for satirical novels, Amis for comic novels, and Greene for thrillers and novels exploring moral and political issues. So, when you think of Sherlock Holmes, remember Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as the mastermind behind the magnifying glass.
