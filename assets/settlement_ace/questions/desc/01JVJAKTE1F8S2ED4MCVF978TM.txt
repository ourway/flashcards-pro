The legal drinking age in the UK is 18, and this is tied to the broader concept of adulthood in British law. Historically, the age of adulthood has varied, but it's been firmly set at 18 for quite some time. This means that at 18, individuals gain various rights and responsibilities, including the right to vote, enter into contracts, and, of course, purchase and consume alcohol in pubs, restaurants, and shops. While some countries have higher drinking ages, the UK's stance reflects a belief that at 18, young adults are mature enough to make responsible decisions about alcohol consumption. You might see 16 and 17-year-olds drinking beer, wine, or cider with a meal in a pub or restaurant, but this is a specific exception and they can't buy the alcohol themselves. So, while 17 might seem close, 18 is the definitive age when you can legally buy and drink alcohol in the UK.
