Okay, let's break down why the Queen handles those important ambassadorial duties. Think of the Queen as the UK's head of state, a role that's evolved over centuries. While the Prime Minister runs the government day-to-day, the Queen embodies the UK and its history. Receiving ambassadors, hosting visiting heads of state, and making state visits are all about representing the nation on the world stage. These are largely ceremonial duties, but they're incredibly important for maintaining diplomatic ties and promoting the UK's interests. The Queen's involvement lends a sense of tradition and continuity, reinforcing the UK's standing. The Speaker is responsible for chairing debates in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister leads the government, and the Foreign Secretary handles foreign policy. While they all interact with international figures, it's the Queen who officially welcomes ambassadors and represents the UK in a symbolic way. It's a role rooted in history, where the monarch was the ultimate representative of the kingdom.
