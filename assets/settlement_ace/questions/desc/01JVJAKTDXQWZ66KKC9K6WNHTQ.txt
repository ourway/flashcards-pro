Okay, let's talk about the Romans and their lasting impact on Britain. The Roman occupation, which began in 43 AD and lasted for nearly 400 years, fundamentally reshaped the island. While they didn't introduce constitutional monarchy or basic democracy – those concepts developed much later – their influence was felt in other crucial areas. One key contribution was the introduction of new plants and animals. The Romans were practical and brought with them various species to improve agriculture and diversify the food supply. Think of things like grapes for wine, rabbits for meat, and various grains and vegetables.

Equally important was their establishment of a structured legal system. Roman law was highly organized and provided a framework for governance and dispute resolution. This system, while not exactly the same as modern British law, laid some of the groundwork for legal principles that would evolve over centuries. So, while the Romans weren't focused on democratic ideals in the way we understand them today, their practical contributions in agriculture and law left an undeniable mark on the development of Britain.
