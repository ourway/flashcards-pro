Okay, let's talk about Wales and England during the time of King Henry VIII. Before Henry, Wales wasn't really part of England in the way we think of it today. It had been conquered centuries earlier, but it was still largely governed by local Welsh lords. Henry VIII, who reigned from 1509 to 1547, fundamentally changed this. He brought in a series of laws known as the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. These laws essentially integrated Wales into the English legal system. They abolished Welsh laws, introduced English as the official language for legal and administrative purposes, and gave Wales representation in the English Parliament. So, while Wales had been under English control for a while, it was Henry VIII who formally united the two countries legally and politically. Think of it as Henry VIII not just being famous for his wives, but also for shaping the political map of Britain!
