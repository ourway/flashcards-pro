The Tate Art Gallery, a collection of four major art museums, is deeply rooted in London's cultural landscape. The original gallery, now known as Tate Britain, opened in 1897 on the site of Millbank Prison. It was established thanks to a donation from sugar magnate Henry Tate, hence the name. Tate Britain focuses on British art from 1500 to the present day. Later, the Tate Modern opened in 2000 in the former Bankside Power Station, showcasing international modern and contemporary art. Given its historical origins and the presence of its two most prominent galleries, Tate Britain and Tate Modern, in London, it's clear why London is the correct answer. While there are Tate galleries in Liverpool and St Ives, the foundation and heart of the Tate collection remain firmly planted in the capital.
