Wales has a rich cultural identity, and a key part of that is its patron saint, St. David. Patron saints are special figures who are seen as protectors or guardians of a particular place or group. St. David, or Dewi Sant in Welsh, lived in the 6th century and was a monk who founded several monasteries. He's known for his piety and for performing miracles. The reason Wales is the correct answer is because St. David is intrinsically linked to Welsh identity. Every year on March 1st, Wales celebrates St. David's Day. People wear daffodils and leeks, which are national symbols, and there are parades and concerts. While England has St. George, Scotland has St. Andrew, and Northern Ireland has St. Patrick, St. David is specifically the patron saint of Wales, making it the only logical answer.
