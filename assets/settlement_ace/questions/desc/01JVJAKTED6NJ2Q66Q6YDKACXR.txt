The Victorian era, spanning from 1837 to 1901 during Queen Victoria's reign, witnessed the peak of the British Empire's power and influence. Think of it as Britain's global expansion hitting its stride. Several factors contributed to this growth, including advancements in naval technology, industrialization, and a strong belief in Britain's right to expand its influence â€“ sometimes referred to as "the white man's burden." During this time, Britain controlled vast territories across the globe, including India, Australia, and large swathes of Africa. India, in particular, was considered the "jewel in the crown" of the Empire, providing immense wealth and resources. So, when we say the British Empire became the largest the world had ever known during the Victorian era, it's because of this massive expansion and control over diverse regions and populations. While other empires were significant, none reached the sheer scale and global reach of the British Empire at its Victorian zenith.
