The European Convention on Human Rights is a really important document that protects fundamental rights and freedoms. It was created in the aftermath of World War II, a time when there was a strong desire to prevent such atrocities from ever happening again. Think of it as a set of rules designed to ensure everyone is treated with dignity and respect. The Council of Europe, an international organisation separate from the EU, drafted the convention. The UK played a key role in its creation and was one of the first countries to sign it in 1950. This was a significant moment, demonstrating the UK's commitment to upholding human rights on an international level. The other dates are far too early; the convention simply didn't exist then. It's worth remembering that the convention is still relevant today, as it forms the basis of human rights law in many European countries, including the UK.
