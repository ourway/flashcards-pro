The jury system in the UK has deep historical roots, evolving over centuries to ensure fair trials. The concept of being judged by your peers dates back to the Magna Carta in 1215, which established the right to a fair trial. Over time, the number of jurors has been standardized, and today, in both England and Wales, a standard jury consists of 12 people. These individuals are randomly selected from the electoral register and are responsible for listening to the evidence presented in court and deciding whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. The number 12 is significant because it's been the established size for centuries, providing a balance between representing a cross-section of society and allowing for effective deliberation. So, when you think about a jury in a Welsh court, remember that it's a group of 12 ordinary citizens entrusted with this vital role in the justice system.
