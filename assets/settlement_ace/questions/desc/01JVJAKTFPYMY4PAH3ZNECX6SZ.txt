The legal framework surrounding alcohol consumption in the UK is pretty straightforward, designed to protect young people and ensure responsible drinking habits. The key age to remember is 18. It's illegal for anyone under 18 to purchase alcohol in a pub, shop, or any other licensed premises. Similarly, it's against the law for adults to buy alcohol for someone under 18, with a few very specific exceptions, like a 16 or 17-year-old drinking beer, wine, or cider with a meal in a licensed premises, when accompanied by an adult. So, even though you might be close to adulthood at 17, the law draws a firm line. While some European countries have lower drinking ages, the UK has maintained 18 as the minimum age for purchasing alcohol for quite some time. This is why it is false that a 17 year old can legally purchase alcohol.
