The voting age in the UK has a fascinating history. For a long time, it was 21, reflecting a belief that younger adults weren't mature enough to make informed political decisions. However, during the 1960s, there was a growing movement to lower the voting age, arguing that if 18-year-olds could be conscripted into the army and fight for their country, they should also have the right to choose their government. This movement gained momentum, and in 1969, the voting age was lowered to 18 through the Representation of the People Act. So, while it might seem like a long time ago, the idea of voting at 21 is outdated. Today, any British citizen, Commonwealth citizen, or citizen of the Republic of Ireland who is resident in the UK can vote in a general election once they are 18 or over and registered to vote.
