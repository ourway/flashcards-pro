William Shakespeare is arguably England's most famous writer, known for his plays and poems written in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. He wrote tragedies like *Hamlet* and *Romeo and Juliet*, histories like *Richard III*, and comedies, which are often lighter and more romantic. *A Midsummer Night's Dream* is one of Shakespeare's most beloved comedies. It's a whimsical play involving fairies, love potions, and mistaken identities, all set in a magical forest. The other options, *Pride and Prejudice* and *Sense and Sensibility*, were written by Jane Austen, a novelist from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. *Great Expectations* is a novel by Charles Dickens, who wrote in the 19th century. So, while all are famous English authors, only *A Midsummer Night's Dream* comes from the pen of William Shakespeare.
