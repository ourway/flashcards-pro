Okay, let's break down the independence of the American colonies. The American Revolutionary War, a major conflict between Great Britain and thirteen of its North American colonies, officially began in 1775. While the American Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, declaring the colonies' intention to be free, this wasn't the end of the story. The war continued for several years. It wasn't until the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783 that Great Britain formally recognized the United States of America as an independent nation. This treaty marked the official end of the Revolutionary War and the beginning of a new era in Anglo-American relations. So, while 1776 is significant for the Declaration, it's 1783 that marks the official British acknowledgement of American independence. Think of it this way: declaring independence is one thing, but having it officially recognized is another!
