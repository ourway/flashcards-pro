Okay, here's an explanation of why the Church of England is known as the Episcopal Church in Scotland and the US. The Church of England, headed by the monarch, has a complex history, especially when we consider its spread beyond England. After the Scottish Reformation in the 16th century, the Church of Scotland became Presbyterian, meaning it's governed by elders, not bishops. However, some Scots still wanted an episcopal structure, meaning governance by bishops. These individuals formed the Scottish Episcopal Church. Now, fast forward to the American Revolution. After the United States gained independence, the Anglican Church in America, which had been tied to the Church of England, needed to reorganize. They couldn't very well have the King of England as their head anymore! So, they adopted a similar episcopal structure and also became known as the Episcopal Church. The term "episcopal" simply refers to a church governed by bishops. So, while the Church of England is Anglican, meaning it follows the traditions and doctrines associated with the Church of England, the specific churches in Scotland and the US that share this heritage but have their own independent structures are called Episcopal Churches. It's a subtle but important distinction.
