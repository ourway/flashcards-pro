Hogmanay is the Scottish name for New Year's Eve, and the celebrations surrounding it. The word itself is of uncertain origin, possibly derived from Norse or Gaelic roots. While the rest of the UK celebrates New Year's Eve, Hogmanay in Scotland is a much bigger deal, often involving days of festivities. Historically, the celebration of Christmas was suppressed in Scotland following the Reformation in the 16th century, making Hogmanay the main winter celebration. Traditions include first-footing, where the first person to cross the threshold of a home after midnight brings symbolic gifts like coal, shortbread, and whisky for good luck. Street parties, ceilidhs (traditional Gaelic social gathering), and the singing of Auld Lang Syne are also common. So, because Hogmanay IS the Scottish New Year's Eve, it's celebrated on the 31st of December. While January 1st is part of the Hogmanay celebrations, the main event always kicks off the night before.
