Margaret Thatcher, often referred to as the "Iron Lady," served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990. This adds up to a continuous term of over 11 years. Now, think about other prominent Prime Ministers in the 20th century. While figures like Winston Churchill were incredibly influential, their terms, especially Churchill's, were shorter and interrupted. Clement Attlee, another significant post-war leader, also had a shorter tenure. Thatcher's 11-plus years in office made her a dominant force in British politics for a significant period. This extended time in power allowed her to implement sweeping economic and social reforms, solidifying her place as the longest-serving UK Prime Minister of the 20th century. So, while other Prime Ministers were important, none held the office continuously for as long as she did during that period.
