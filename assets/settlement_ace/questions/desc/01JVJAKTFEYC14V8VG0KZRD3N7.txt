The fight for women's right to vote, known as women's suffrage, was a long and arduous struggle in Britain. While the movement had roots earlier, the suffragettes, known for their more militant tactics, emerged in the early 20th century. These women believed that direct action and civil disobedience were necessary to gain attention and force the government to act. The Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) was at the forefront of this movement, and its leader was Emmeline Pankhurst. She, along with her daughters Christabel and Sylvia, organised protests, marches, and even acts of vandalism to raise awareness. While Queen Victoria was a powerful female monarch, she lived in an era before the suffragette movement gained momentum. Oliver Cromwell was a key figure in the 17th century, long before women's suffrage was a prominent issue. Florence Nightingale was a celebrated nurse and social reformer, but she was not directly involved in leading the suffragette movement. Therefore, Emmeline Pankhurst is the correct answer because she was the driving force and leader behind the suffragettes and their campaign for women's voting rights.
