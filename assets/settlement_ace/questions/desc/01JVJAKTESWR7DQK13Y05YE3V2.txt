Hadrian's Wall is one of the most iconic Roman structures in Britain, stretching across the width of northern England. It wasn't just a wall; it was a complex defensive system including forts, milecastles, and turrets. The Romans began building it around AD 122, during the reign of Emperor Hadrian. Now, why Hadrian? Well, Roman emperors often initiated large-scale building projects to consolidate their power, provide employment, and, most importantly, defend their territories. Hadrian himself visited Britain and decided that a clear boundary was needed to separate Roman Britain from the Picts, who lived in what is now Scotland. So, the wall was named after him, reflecting his direct involvement and authority. Sutton Hoo is an Anglo-Saxon burial site, King Alfred the Great was a later Anglo-Saxon king who fought against the Vikings, and there was no "Henry Hadrian," so those names have nothing to do with the Roman era or the wall's construction.
