The thistle's association with Scotland is a tale of resilience and legend. Back in the 13th century, during the reign of Alexander III, Norse invaders attempted a surprise attack on the Scottish army. To move silently, they removed their boots. However, one unfortunate Norseman stepped on a prickly thistle, and his cry of pain alerted the Scots, who successfully defended themselves. This event cemented the thistle as a symbol of Scotland's tenacious spirit and a guardian of its land. While England has the rose, Wales the daffodil, and Northern Ireland the shamrock, the thistle is uniquely and historically tied to Scotland's identity. It appears on Scottish coinage, the badges of Scottish regiments, and is a recurring motif in Scottish art and heraldry. So, while the other options represent other parts of the UK, the thistle is distinctly Scottish.
