The Cenotaph, a key war memorial in London, stands as a powerful symbol of remembrance for those who lost their lives in World War I and subsequent conflicts. Understanding its origins helps us appreciate its significance. After the First World War, there was a strong desire for a permanent national memorial. Sir Edwin Lutyens, a prominent British architect known for his elegant and monumental designs, was commissioned to create it. He initially designed a temporary wood and plaster structure for the 1919 peace parade, but its popularity led to the construction of a permanent stone version in 1920. Lutyens' design, a simple yet striking obelisk, became hugely influential and served as a model for war memorials across the British Empire and beyond. While Sir Christopher Wren is famous for rebuilding London after the Great Fire, Robert Adam for his neoclassical country houses, and Inigo Jones for introducing Italian Renaissance architecture to England, it was Lutyens whose name is synonymous with war memorials, making him the correct answer.
