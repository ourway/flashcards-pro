The Brit Awards, often simply called the Brits, are the British Phonographic Industry's annual popular music awards. Think of them as the UK's equivalent to the American Grammy Awards. They started back in 1977 but became an annual event in 1982. The awards celebrate achievements in British and international music. So, naturally, the prestigious awards at the Brits are given to musicians. While sports people are celebrated at events like the BBC Sports Personality of the Year, and wealth isn't a factor in receiving awards, the Brits are specifically about recognizing talent and success in the music industry. It's a night for singers, songwriters, bands, and producers to be acknowledged for their contributions to the music scene.
