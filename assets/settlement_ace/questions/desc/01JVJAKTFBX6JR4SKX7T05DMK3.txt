Westminster is the heart of the UK's political system, and it's where the UK Parliament meets to make laws. Think of it as the central hub for governing the entire United Kingdom. The UK Parliament is bicameral, meaning it has two chambers: the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The House of Commons is where elected Members of Parliament (MPs) debate and vote on new laws, while the House of Lords is made up of appointed members who scrutinize legislation. The Palace of Westminster, often just called the Houses of Parliament, is an iconic building located in London. It's easily recognizable by its clock tower, which houses the famous Big Ben bell. While Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have their own devolved governments and assemblies to manage regional matters, the UK Parliament in Westminster is responsible for laws that affect the whole of the UK, including things like defense, foreign policy, and immigration. So, when you think about the governing parliament of the UK, Westminster is the place to remember.
