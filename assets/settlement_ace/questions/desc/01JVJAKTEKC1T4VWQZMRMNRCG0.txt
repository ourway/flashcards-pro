Okay, let's talk about British TV! When we think about shows that are *popular* and have a *long* history in the UK, "Coronation Street" immediately springs to mind. This soap opera has been a staple of British television since 1960! That's over 60 years of drama, romance, and everyday life in the fictional town of Weatherfield. It's more than just a TV show; it's a cultural institution. Generations of Brits have grown up watching it, and it reflects changing social attitudes and trends over the decades. While "Friends," "The Big Bang Theory," and "How I Met Your Mother" are certainly popular sitcoms, they are American shows. They have a following in the UK, but they aren't *British* television series. "Coronation Street," on the other hand, is uniquely British, with its northern setting, working-class characters, and distinctive humour. It's a show that truly resonates with British audiences, making it the right answer.
