Okay, let's talk about the UK's population in 1998. Understanding population trends gives you a sense of the country's growth and how it has changed over time. In the late 1990s, the UK's population was steadily growing, but it hadn't yet reached the higher figures we see today. The population was definitely more than 42 million, which would have been more typical of the mid-20th century. And while 62 or 75 million might sound plausible, those figures are closer to the population estimates in more recent years. So, the estimated population of the UK in 1998 was around 57 million people. A helpful memory trick is to think of "57 varieties," like the Heinz slogan, to remember this number.
