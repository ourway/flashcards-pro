March is a busy month for patron saints! While England celebrates St. George in April, March is dedicated to both St. David and St. Patrick. St. David is the patron saint of Wales, and his feast day is celebrated on March 1st. He was a Welsh bishop during the 6th century and is known for founding several monasteries. Welsh people often wear daffodils or leeks on St. David's Day to commemorate him. Then, on March 17th, we celebrate St. Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland. He's credited with bringing Christianity to Ireland in the 5th century. Celebrations for St. Patrick's Day often involve wearing green, attending parades, and enjoying Irish music and dance. So, while St. George and St. Andrew are important patron saints for England and Scotland respectively, they have their own dedicated days later in the year. March is specifically the time to remember both St. David and St. Patrick.
