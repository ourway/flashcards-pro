The Commonwealth is a fascinating organization, essentially a voluntary association of 56 independent countries. What ties them together is their historical link to the British Empire. Many were former colonies, and they choose to maintain friendly cooperation. Think of it as a club based on shared history and values. Now, Canada, Barbados, and the UK are all part of that club. Canada, of course, was a British colony for a long time. Barbados gained independence from Britain in 1966 but chose to remain in the Commonwealth. The UK is the head of the Commonwealth. The USA, however, is a different story. After the American Revolution in 1776, the thirteen colonies declared independence from Britain. While relations between the UK and the USA are strong today, the USA never became part of the Commonwealth because it broke away from the British Empire rather than evolving into an independent member. So, the USA is the odd one out in this list.
