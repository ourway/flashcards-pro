Cricket rivalries don't get much bigger than England versus Australia! This clash is steeped in history and known as "The Ashes." The name actually comes from a satirical obituary published in 1882 after Australia beat England on English soil for the first time. The Sporting Times newspaper jokingly declared that English cricket had died, and "the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia." So, the following tour to Australia became a quest to regain those symbolic ashes. While the actual object representing "The Ashes" is a small urn, its contents are a bit of a mystery â€“ some say it contains burnt bails, others cricket equipment, or even a lady's veil! Regardless, the name stuck, and "The Ashes" series is now one of the most fiercely contested and celebrated events in the cricketing world. The other options are all significant sporting events, but they're not related to cricket or the specific England-Australia rivalry. The Six Nations is rugby, The Grand National is horse racing, and the Australian Open is tennis.
