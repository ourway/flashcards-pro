Boudicca, also spelled Boudica, was the Queen of the Iceni tribe in what is now Norfolk, England, during the 1st century AD. The Romans had conquered much of Britain, but some tribes, like the Iceni, were initially allowed to rule as allies. However, when Boudicca's husband died, the Romans seized his lands and mistreated her and her daughters. This sparked a major rebellion in AD 60 or 61. Boudicca led the Iceni and other tribes in a fierce uprising, destroying Roman settlements like Colchester, London, and Verulamium (modern-day St Albans). Although her rebellion was ultimately crushed by the Roman army, Boudicca became a symbol of British resistance against foreign rule. Her story, though tragic, is a powerful reminder of the early struggles for freedom in Britain. That's why she is memorialized with a statue near Westminster Bridge. While Elizabeth and Mary were also significant queens in British history, they lived much later. Elefieta is not a known historical figure in British history.
