Okay, let's break down the factions involved in the English Civil War. This conflict, which raged from 1642 to 1651, was a pivotal moment in British history, essentially a power struggle between the King and Parliament. On one side, you had the Royalists, also known as Cavaliers. These were supporters of King Charles I, often wealthy landowners and members of the aristocracy who believed in the divine right of kings. Think of them as the stylish, long-haired supporters of the monarchy. On the other side were the Parliamentarians, nicknamed Roundheads because many of them had closely cropped hair as a sign of their puritan beliefs and rejection of the elaborate styles of the Royal court. They largely consisted of Puritans, merchants, and some members of the gentry who wanted more say in how the country was governed. So, the correct answer is the Roundheads and the Cavaliers because these were the two main opposing sides battling for control of England during that turbulent period. The other options simply don't reflect the historical divisions of the time.
