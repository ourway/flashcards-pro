The year 1969 marked a significant shift in British political history with the introduction of the Representation of the People Act. Before this, the voting age was 21. There had been increasing pressure to lower it, reflecting a broader movement towards youth empowerment and recognition of young adults' contributions to society, especially with many 18-20 year olds serving in the military. The government recognized that if someone was old enough to fight for their country, they should also have the right to vote for its leaders. While 1918 was a landmark year for women's suffrage, it only granted voting rights to women over 30 who met certain property qualifications. 1928 was when women achieved equal voting rights with men, but the age was still 21. 1949 saw some changes to electoral boundaries but not the voting age itself. So, 1969 is the correct answer because it's the year the voting age was lowered to 18 for everyone, solidifying a more inclusive democratic process.
