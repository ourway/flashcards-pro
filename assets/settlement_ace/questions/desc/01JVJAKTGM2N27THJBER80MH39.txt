The English Civil War, a tumultuous period in British history from 1642 to 1651, saw the country deeply divided. On one side were those loyal to the monarchy, specifically King Charles I. These supporters were known as Cavaliers. The term "Cavalier" originally referred to aristocratic horsemen, and it became a fitting label for the King's followers, many of whom were nobles and landowners. They often sported elaborate clothing and long hair, a stark contrast to their opponents. The opposing side, Parliament, was supported by the Roundheads. This name derived from the close-cropped hairstyles favoured by many of the Parliamentarians, particularly the apprentices and Puritans amongst them, as a sign of their disapproval of the Cavalier's perceived vanity. So, while the Chartists were a 19th-century working-class movement advocating for political reforms and the Quakers were a religious group founded in the 17th century, neither were involved in the 17th century Civil War. The Cavaliers were the King's men, easily distinguished by their allegiance and appearance.
