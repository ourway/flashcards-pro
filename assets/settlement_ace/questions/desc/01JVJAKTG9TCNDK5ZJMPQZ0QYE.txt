Snowdonia National Park, known as Eryri in Welsh, is located in Wales. The name "Snowdonia" comes from Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales and England, standing at 1,085 metres. The park was established in 1951 as one of the first three national parks in Britain, reflecting the importance of preserving its unique landscape and cultural heritage. It covers 823 square miles of diverse terrain, including mountains, lakes, forests, and coastline. Snowdonia is deeply intertwined with Welsh history and mythology, featuring prominently in legends like those of King Arthur. While Scotland also boasts stunning national parks like Loch Lomond and the Trossachs, and England has areas of natural beauty like the Lake District, Snowdonia's distinct geological features, Welsh language and cultural significance firmly place it in Wales. So, if you're thinking about dramatic landscapes and the Welsh language, Snowdonia is your answer.
