The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 54 independent countries, most of which were formerly part of the British Empire. Think of it as a club of nations with shared history and values, working together on things like trade, development, and democracy. Now, while the Commonwealth has a Secretary-General who handles the day-to-day operations, there's also a symbolic head. This is where the Queen comes in. The Queen holds the ceremonial title of Head of the Commonwealth, a role that symbolizes the historical ties and shared heritage of the member nations. It's a symbolic position, not one of political power, but it represents the unity and cooperation within the Commonwealth. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) is a completely separate body focused on charities in the UK, and NATO is a military alliance, so neither of those would be relevant to the Commonwealth's leadership.
