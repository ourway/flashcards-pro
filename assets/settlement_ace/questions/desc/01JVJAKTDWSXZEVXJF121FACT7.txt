Halloween, celebrated on October 31st, has very deep roots stretching back to ancient Celtic traditions. It originated with the festival of Samhain, which marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter â€“ a time of year often associated with death and the supernatural. The Celts believed that on this night, the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead became blurred. This is why the correct answer mentions its roots in a pagan festival marking the beginning of winter. Over time, Samhain evolved, incorporating elements of other traditions, and eventually became the Halloween we know today. It's definitely not a modern invention, as its origins are centuries old, and it's widely celebrated in Scotland, just like in other parts of the UK and the world. While some cultures exchange gifts on other holidays, Halloween is more about costumes, trick-or-treating, and remembering the departed.
