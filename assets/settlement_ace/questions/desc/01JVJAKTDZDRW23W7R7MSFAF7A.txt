Cornwall, located in the southwestern tip of England, benefits from a mild, almost Mediterranean climate thanks to the Gulf Stream. This unique climate makes it an ideal location for the Eden Project, which opened in 2001. The Eden Project is famous for its massive biomes, geodesic structures housing diverse plant species from around the world. These biomes recreate different climate zones, such as rainforests and Mediterranean environments. The project aims to educate visitors about conservation and sustainable living. While Devon, Somerset, and Wales are all beautiful areas in the UK, they don't have the specific combination of climate and the Eden Project's location. So, if you're looking to explore the Eden Project's incredible biomes, you'll need to head to Cornwall.
