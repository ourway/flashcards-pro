After the Second World War, there was a huge push in Britain to rebuild society and create a fairer system for everyone. People had endured years of hardship, and there was a strong desire for a more comprehensive safety net. The creation of the National Health Service, or NHS, in 1948 was a landmark moment. Before this, healthcare wasn't universally accessible, and many people struggled to afford it. The NHS aimed to provide free healthcare to all, funded through taxes. Simultaneously, the government established a comprehensive social security system. This system provided financial assistance to people who were unemployed, sick, or elderly. This was a major step towards alleviating poverty and ensuring a basic standard of living for everyone. While employment exchanges existed before this period to help people find work, and the state retirement pension was introduced earlier in the 20th century, the NHS and the universal social security system were the two truly transformative welfare changes that reshaped British society in the immediate post-war years.
