Halloween, celebrated on October 31st, isn't just a modern import from America; its roots run much deeper, tracing back to ancient Celtic traditions. Specifically, it evolved from the pagan festival of Samhain, pronounced "sow-in." Samhain marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter – a time of year often associated with death and the supernatural. The Celts believed that on this night, the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead blurred, allowing spirits to roam freely. This is why customs like dressing up in costumes and lighting bonfires developed – to ward off evil spirits. While Halloween has certainly been popularized in recent times by American culture, its origins are firmly planted in ancient European, particularly Celtic, traditions. So, the statement that Halloween is an ancient festival with roots in the pagan festival to mark the beginning of winter is the accurate one.
