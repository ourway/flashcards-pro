The Domesday Book is a fascinating historical document commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1085, just nineteen years after the Norman Conquest of 1066. William needed to consolidate his power and understand the wealth of his new kingdom. Think of it as a comprehensive survey, almost like a census and property assessment rolled into one. Royal officials went across England, recording who owned what land, how many people lived there, what resources were available, and what taxes could be levied. It's incredibly detailed, listing everything from livestock to ploughs. Because it was so thorough and left no stone unturned, people at the time nicknamed it the "Domesday Book," referring to the "Day of Judgement" when everyone would be accountable. So, yes, the Domesday Book absolutely provides a detailed snapshot of English society immediately following the Norman Conquest, giving us invaluable insights into land ownership, social structure, and economic activity of the time. It's a primary source that historians still use today to understand this pivotal period in British history.
