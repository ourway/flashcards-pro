The House of Lords, while part of the UK Parliament, doesn't simply rubber-stamp everything the government wants. Think of it as a revising chamber, a second set of eyes on proposed laws. Historically, the Lords was made up of hereditary peers, but reforms, especially in 1999, significantly reduced their number. Now, it includes life peers appointed for their expertise and experience in various fields. This mix of backgrounds means the Lords often brings a different perspective to debates than the House of Commons. They can propose amendments to legislation, and while the Commons can ultimately overrule them, the Lords can delay bills and force the government to reconsider its proposals. So, while the government usually gets its way eventually, the House of Lords plays a crucial role in scrutinizing legislation and holding the government to account, making it false to say they always act as the government wishes. It's a vital check and balance in the UK's democratic system.
