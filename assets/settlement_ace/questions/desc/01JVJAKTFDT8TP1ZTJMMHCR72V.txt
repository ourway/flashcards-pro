Pantomimes are a beloved British theatrical tradition, especially around Christmas time. Think of them as a fun, over-the-top stage adaptation of well-known children's stories. The key here is that they almost always draw their plots and characters from classic fairy tales like Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, or Aladdin. While pantomimes add a lot of their own unique elements – slapstick comedy, audience participation, and men dressed as women (and vice versa!) – the core story is usually a recognizable fairy tale. That's why the answer is true. They provide a familiar framework that audiences can easily follow and enjoy, even with all the added silliness. It's easy to see why someone might think they're *not* based on fairy tales, given how much they deviate, but the underlying narrative is almost always a classic story.
