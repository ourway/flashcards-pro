In the UK, the concept of marital rape was historically a complex legal issue. For a long time, the law operated under the outdated assumption that a woman consented to sexual intercourse simply by virtue of being married. However, this changed significantly over time, reflecting evolving societal attitudes towards women's rights and bodily autonomy. Landmark legal cases and parliamentary acts were crucial in overturning this presumption. The key turning point was the recognition that consent is absolutely essential for any sexual act, regardless of the relationship between the individuals involved. Therefore, the idea that a husband cannot be prosecuted for forcing his wife to have sex is unequivocally false under current UK law. Consent must be freely and enthusiastically given, and the absence of consent makes the act a crime. It's a fundamental principle of sexual offences legislation in the UK today.
