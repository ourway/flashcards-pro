Alright, let's talk about Britain's earliest farmers. When we think about the first people to settle down and cultivate the land in Britain, we're talking about the Neolithic period, which started around 4000 BC. These weren't just nomads anymore; they were establishing settlements. So, what did they need? Well, first and foremost, they needed shelter. Simple houses were essential for protecting themselves and their families from the elements. But it wasn't just about basic survival. These early farmers also built monuments, and these monuments were often communal projects, demonstrating a sense of community and shared beliefs. Think of Stonehenge, for example, which was started during this period. These weren't just random piles of stones; they were carefully constructed sites, likely used for rituals and ceremonies. So, while later societies would build things like roads and hospitals, the earliest farmers focused on the essentials: places to live and places to gather and worship.
