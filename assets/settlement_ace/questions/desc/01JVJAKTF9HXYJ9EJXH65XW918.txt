Okay, let's talk about the Whigs and Tories. In the early 18th century, British politics was really starting to take shape, and these two groups were the main players in Parliament. Think of them as the forerunners of today's political parties. The Whigs generally supported constitutional monarchy and were often associated with the interests of the wealthy merchant class and some aristocratic families. They were generally more open to religious tolerance and limiting the power of the Crown. On the other hand, the Tories tended to support the authority of the monarchy and the Church of England. They often represented the interests of the landed gentry and the traditional social order. This division dates back to the Exclusion Crisis of the late 17th century, when they debated excluding the Catholic James II from the throne. So, while "Labour" and "Nationalists" are modern political terms, back in the early 1700s, it was all about the Whigs and Tories battling it out in Parliament. Their rivalry shaped the political landscape of the time and laid the groundwork for the party system we know today.
