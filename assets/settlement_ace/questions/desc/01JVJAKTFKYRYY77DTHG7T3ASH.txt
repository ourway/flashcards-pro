The King James Bible, a cornerstone of English literature and religious history, wasn't just any translation. It was commissioned in 1604 by King James I, who wanted a new version of the Bible that would be acceptable to all parties within the Church of England. Think of it as a project aimed at unifying the church after years of religious turmoil! The translation work was extensive, involving 47 scholars, and it was finally published in 1611. Because it was officially sanctioned by the King himself, it became known as the Authorised Version. This wasn't just a catchy name; it signified its official status and widespread acceptance within the Church of England and beyond. While it's true the King James Bible is a Protestant translation, that's a general category, not a specific name. The "Authorised Version" highlights the unique and official endorsement that set this particular translation apart.
