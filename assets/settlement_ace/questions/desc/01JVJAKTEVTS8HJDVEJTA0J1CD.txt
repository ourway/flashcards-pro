The Battle of Agincourt, fought in 1415, is really a landmark event in English history, primarily because it's the most famous battle of the Hundred Years War. This war was a long and complex conflict between England and France that actually stretched on for over a century, from 1337 to 1453. Agincourt stands out because the English army, led by King Henry V, achieved a stunning victory against a much larger French force. The English, though heavily outnumbered, used their longbows to devastating effect, turning the muddy battlefield into a graveyard for French knights. While other battles occurred during the Hundred Years War, Agincourt captured the imagination of the public and became a symbol of English military prowess. It wasn't a battle against the Scottish or Romans, and it predates the Wars of the Roses, making it uniquely tied to the Hundred Years War in popular memory.
