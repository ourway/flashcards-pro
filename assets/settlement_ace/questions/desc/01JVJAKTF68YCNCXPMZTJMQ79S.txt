The House of Lords plays a crucial role in the UK Parliament, acting as a revising chamber for laws passed by the House of Commons. However, unlike the House of Commons, whose members are elected by the public in general elections, the composition of the House of Lords is quite different. It's made up of Lords Spiritual, who are senior bishops of the Church of England, and Lords Temporal, who are mostly appointed life peers. Historically, hereditary peers inherited their seats, but reforms have significantly reduced their number. Life peers are appointed based on their distinguished service and contributions to various fields, such as science, arts, or public service. So, while they bring valuable expertise and experience to the legislative process, they aren't chosen through a public vote. This non-elected nature is a key distinction between the two houses of Parliament. It's easy to confuse the Lords with the Commons, but remembering that Lords are appointed or inherit their positions, not elected, is essential for the test.
