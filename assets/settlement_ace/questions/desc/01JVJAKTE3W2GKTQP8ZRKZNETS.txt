The Union Flag, often called the Union Jack, is a powerful symbol of the United Kingdom, and its design tells a story of unification. It's not just a random arrangement of colors; each cross represents a patron saint of the nations that make up the UK. We all know the red cross of St. George represents England. The other two crosses represent Scotland and Ireland. The white diagonal cross is St. Andrew's Cross, the patron saint of Scotland. St. Andrew was one of Jesus's apostles, and tradition says he was crucified on an X-shaped cross. The red diagonal cross is St. Patrick's Cross, representing Ireland. St. Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland and is credited with bringing Christianity to the country. It's interesting to note that Wales isn't directly represented in the Union Flag, which is a common point of discussion. St. David is the patron saint of Wales, but his cross isn't included. St Piran is the patron saint of Cornwall. So, the Union Flag combines the crosses of St. George, St. Andrew, and St. Patrick to symbolize the union of England, Scotland, and Ireland.
