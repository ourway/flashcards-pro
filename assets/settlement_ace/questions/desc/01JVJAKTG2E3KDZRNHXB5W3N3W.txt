Alright, let's unravel the story of William the Conqueror's England. After William's victory at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, he needed to understand and control his new kingdom. That's where the Domesday Book comes in. Commissioned in 1085, it was a comprehensive survey of England, detailing who owned what land, how many people lived there, and what resources were available. Think of it as William's way of taking stock and figuring out how to tax everyone! Then there's the Bayeux Tapestry. This isn't exactly a book, but it's a fantastic visual record. It's a huge embroidered cloth, nearly 70 meters long, depicting the events leading up to the Norman Conquest and the Battle of Hastings itself. It's a propaganda piece, of course, showing William as the rightful heir to the English throne. So, both the Domesday Book and the Bayeux Tapestry offer unique insights into England during William I's reign â€“ one through detailed data, the other through a compelling visual narrative. The Magna Carta came much later, in 1215, and The Canterbury Tales are fictional stories written by Geoffrey Chaucer in the late 14th century, long after William's time.
