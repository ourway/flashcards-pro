The 19th century in Britain was a period of significant social and political change, driven by the Industrial Revolution and a growing awareness of social inequalities. The Chartists emerged as a powerful movement advocating for parliamentary reform. Their name comes from the People's Charter, a document outlining six key demands: universal male suffrage (the right to vote for all men), secret ballots, equal electoral districts, abolition of property qualifications for MPs, payment for MPs, and annual parliamentary elections. These demands aimed to make the political system fairer and more representative of the working class. The movement gained momentum in the 1830s and 1840s, holding large rallies and presenting petitions to Parliament. While the Chartists didn't achieve all their aims immediately, their campaign played a crucial role in paving the way for later reforms that expanded voting rights and made the political system more democratic. So, the statement about the Chartists campaigning for voting reform in the 1830s and 1840s is indeed true.
