After the execution of King Charles I in 1649, England entered a unique period in its history. Instead of immediately crowning a new monarch, Parliament decided to abolish the monarchy altogether. This led to the establishment of a republic known as the Commonwealth of England. Oliver Cromwell, a key figure in the Parliamentary victory during the Civil War, rose to prominence. However, he never became king. Instead, in 1653, he assumed the title of Lord Protector, essentially becoming the head of state but under a different name. This title was an attempt to avoid the connotations of absolute power associated with the monarchy. While Cromwell wielded significant authority, he always maintained that he was serving at the behest of Parliament. So, although he was a powerful leader, the idea that he became king is incorrect; England was a republic, and he was the Lord Protector. It's a common misconception because he held a position of similar power, but the title and the political system were fundamentally different.
