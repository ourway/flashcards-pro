Okay, let's talk about the Queen and Parliament. The opening of a new parliamentary session is a really important event steeped in tradition. Think of it as the official start of the government's working year. The Queen plays a central role, and it's not just ceremonial. She delivers a speech, often referred to as the Queen's Speech, but here's the key thing: she doesn't write it herself. The speech is actually written by the government of the day, outlining their policies and proposed laws for the coming session. So, when the Queen reads the speech, she's essentially presenting the government's agenda to Parliament. It's a symbolic act, demonstrating the link between the Crown, the government, and the people. The Queen's presence and delivery of the speech are fundamental to the formal opening of Parliament, setting the stage for the debates and legislation that will follow. Therefore, the statement is true.
