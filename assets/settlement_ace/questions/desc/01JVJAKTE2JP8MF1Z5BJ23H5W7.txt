England's economy during the Middle Ages, roughly from the 11th to the 15th centuries, was heavily reliant on agriculture, and one particular agricultural product dominated: wool. The country had ideal conditions for raising sheep, and the demand for English wool across Europe was incredibly high. Think of the Low Countries, like Flanders, which were famous for their cloth production but needed a constant supply of raw materials. English wool became the backbone of their industry. This trade was so important that it influenced English politics and foreign policy. The Lord Chancellor even traditionally sat on the 'woolsack' in the House of Lords, a cushion stuffed with wool, symbolizing the importance of the wool trade to the nation's wealth. While potatoes are now a staple, they weren't introduced to Europe until after the Columbian Exchange much later. Glass production existed, but wasn't a major export. And while stone was quarried and used for building, it wasn't a widely traded commodity like wool.
