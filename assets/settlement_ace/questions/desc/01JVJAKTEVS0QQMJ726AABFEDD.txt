The Speaker of the House of Commons is essentially the referee in Parliament, ensuring debates run smoothly and fairly. Because of this impartial role, the Speaker can't be chosen by just one person like the Prime Minister or the Monarch. Instead, it's a decision made by the entire group of Members of Parliament, or MPs. After a general election, or when a Speaker retires, MPs hold a secret ballot to elect someone from among themselves. This ensures the Speaker has the confidence of the House as a whole and can act impartially. The Queen or King plays a role in formally approving the appointment, but the real decision lies with the elected representatives. The Home Secretary has no role in this process. Think of it like this: the MPs are choosing their own leader and voice within Parliament.
