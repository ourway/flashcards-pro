Think of the UK as a team, and the devolved administrations – Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland – as key players. Each player has specific roles, but the overall strategy is still managed centrally. Devolution, which started in 1999, granted these regions greater control over local issues like education, healthcare, and some aspects of law and order. However, certain powers are reserved for the UK Parliament in Westminster to ensure consistency and unity across the country. These reserved powers include things like immigration, which affects the entire UK's borders and population; foreign affairs, as the UK speaks with one voice on the global stage; and taxation, which is crucial for managing the national economy. Giving these powers to individual regions could create conflicting policies and economic instability. So, while devolved administrations have significant authority, these high-level matters remain with the central government.
