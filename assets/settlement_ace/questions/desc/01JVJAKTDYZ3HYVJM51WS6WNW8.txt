In British politics, a general election determines which party will form the government. Usually, the party that wins the majority of seats in the House of Commons gets to form a government led by their leader as Prime Minister. However, the 2010 general election was different. No single party secured an outright majority. This situation is called a "hung parliament." The Conservative Party won the most seats, but not enough to govern alone. After days of intense negotiations, the Conservatives, led by David Cameron, and the Liberal Democrats, led by Nick Clegg, agreed to form a coalition government. This was a significant event because coalition governments are relatively rare in modern British history. So, while the Conservatives won the most seats, the election's outcome was unique because it resulted in a power-sharing agreement between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. The other parties, like Labour, didn't have enough seats to form a government.
