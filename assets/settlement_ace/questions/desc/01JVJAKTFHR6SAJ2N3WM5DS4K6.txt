Christmas in Britain is steeped in tradition, and the Christmas dinner is a central part of that. The tradition of eating turkey at Christmas became popular in England in the 16th century, with King Henry VIII being one of the first to enjoy it. Before that, goose, peacock, or even a boar's head were common festive meals. Turkey became more widely accessible and affordable in the 19th and 20th centuries, solidifying its place as the centerpiece of the Christmas feast. Christmas pudding, a rich, dark, steamed pudding packed with dried fruit and spices, is another essential element. It's often prepared weeks in advance and doused in brandy before being set alight at the table for a dramatic flourish. The "rich steamed pudding" is a more general term that can encompass variations of Christmas pudding or other similar desserts, ensuring there's a sweet and satisfying end to the meal. While other dishes like lamb curry or fish and chips are popular in Britain, they aren't traditionally associated with the specific customs of a Christmas dinner.
