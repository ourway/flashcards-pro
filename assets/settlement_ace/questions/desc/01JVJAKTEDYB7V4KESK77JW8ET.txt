The UK National Anthem, "God Save the Queen" (or "King," depending on the monarch), is a patriotic song with roots stretching back centuries. While the exact origins are debated, a version was popular as far back as 1745, during a time of Jacobite rebellions. The words and melody became standardized over time, evolving into the version we know today. The anthem is a prayer for the monarch's well-being and a declaration of loyalty to the crown. Many people mistakenly think the opening lines include words like "Royal" or "Majesty" because these words are often associated with royalty. However, the actual opening lines are "God save our gracious Queen, long live our noble Queen." So, "Gracious" and "Noble" are the two words that appear right at the beginning, reflecting the qualities people hope for in their head of state. It's a good idea to memorize the first verse, as it's a key part of British culture and identity.
