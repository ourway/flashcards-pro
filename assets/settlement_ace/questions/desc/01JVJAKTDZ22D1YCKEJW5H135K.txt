The First World War, a brutal conflict from 1914 to 1918, profoundly impacted British society, and its horrors found expression in the works of a generation of poets. Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon are particularly remembered for their unflinching portrayals of trench warfare. Both men served in the war and their poetry reflects their direct experiences of the conflict's physical and psychological toll. Owen's poems, like "Dulce et Decorum Est," vividly depict the gas attacks and the senseless waste of life. Sassoon, initially a patriotic soldier, became increasingly disillusioned with the war, and his poems often satirized the incompetence of military leaders and the romanticized view of war held by those at home. Their work stands as a powerful testament to the realities faced by soldiers on the Western Front. While other authors explored themes of war, Owen and Sassoon are specifically known for writing directly about their own experiences *in* the First World War, making them the correct pair.
