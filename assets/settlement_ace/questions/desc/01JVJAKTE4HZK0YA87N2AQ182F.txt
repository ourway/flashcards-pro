King Henry VIII, who reigned from 1509 to 1547, is a pivotal figure in British history, primarily remembered for two major things. First, he initiated the English Reformation, breaking away from the authority of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church in the 1530s. This seismic shift was driven by his desire to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, something the Pope wouldn't allow. Henry wanted a male heir to secure the Tudor dynasty, and Catherine had only produced a daughter, Mary. So, he declared himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England, granting himself the power to divorce. Secondly, Henry VIII is notorious for his six marriages. He famously went through wives in his quest for a male heir. While he was a patron of the arts and a powerful ruler, these two aspects – the religious upheaval and his marital history – are what truly define his legacy and are most frequently tested on. Other achievements are overshadowed by these defining actions.
