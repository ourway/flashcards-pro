The British Isles is a complex collection of territories, and it's easy to get confused about the different statuses of places like England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and the Channel Islands. England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland make up the United Kingdom itself. But the Channel Islands, located off the coast of France, are a Crown dependency. This means they aren't part of the UK, but they are self-governing and the British monarch is their Head of State. This relationship dates back to the Norman Conquest in 1066, when the Duke of Normandy (who became William the Conqueror) also ruled these islands. While the UK Parliament legislates for the islands in some areas, like defence and foreign affairs, the Channel Islands have their own legislative assemblies, legal systems, and courts. They are neither part of the UK nor the European Union, adding to their unique position. So, when you see "Crown dependency," think of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man â€“ they have a special relationship with the UK, but aren't actually *in* it.
