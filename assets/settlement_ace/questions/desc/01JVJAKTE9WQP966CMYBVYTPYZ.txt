The European Convention on Human Rights, adopted in 1950 and enforced by the European Court of Human Rights, is all about protecting fundamental rights and freedoms. Think of it as a cornerstone of human rights protection in Europe. It covers a range of essential rights, including the right to a fair trial, freedom of thought, and freedom from torture. The most fundamental of all these rights is the right to life. Without the right to life, none of the other rights matter. The other options listed are either incorrect interpretations or direct contradictions of the Convention. For example, the Convention protects freedom of expression, not its prohibition, and it certainly doesn't grant a "right to fight." It also prohibits slavery and forced labour, not the other way around. While the right to wear any clothes might seem like a freedom, it's not specifically enshrined in the Convention as a standalone right.
