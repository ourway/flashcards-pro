The UK Parliament, the legislative body of the United Kingdom, operates with a bicameral system, meaning it's composed of two chambers. Think of it like a two-layered cake! These two chambers are the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The House of Commons is where elected Members of Parliament (MPs) represent their constituencies, the general public. They are directly accountable to the people through elections, making it the primary chamber for making laws. The House of Lords, on the other hand, is made up of appointed members, including life peers, hereditary peers, and bishops of the Church of England. Historically, the Lords represented the aristocracy and the Church, providing a check on the power of the Commons. While its power has been reduced over time, it still plays a crucial role in scrutinizing legislation passed by the Commons. So, the UK Parliament is structured with these two distinct houses, each with its own composition and functions, working together to create the laws of the land. The House of Representatives is part of the US Congress, and the House of Fraser is a department store!
