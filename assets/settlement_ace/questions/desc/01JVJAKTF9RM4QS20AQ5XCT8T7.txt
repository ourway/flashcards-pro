Father's Day in the UK, like in the United States, is celebrated on the third Sunday of June. This tradition of celebrating fathers originated in the US in the early 20th century. Sonora Smart Dodd, from Spokane, Washington, is credited with initiating the holiday to honor her father, a Civil War veteran who raised her and her siblings as a single parent. While the first Father's Day celebrations were local, the idea gained traction over the years. By the mid-20th century, it became a nationally recognized holiday in the US, and the UK followed suit. The specific date was chosen to provide enough time after Mother's Day in May, allowing families to celebrate both parents without the holidays being too close together. So, remembering that Father's Day falls on the third Sunday of June helps you recall the timing and its place within the calendar of family celebrations. The first, second, and fourth Sundays are simply incorrect options, as the third Sunday has become the established date for this celebration.
