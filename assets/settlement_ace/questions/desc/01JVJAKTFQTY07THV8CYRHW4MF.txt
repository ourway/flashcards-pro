The British national anthem, "God Save the Queen" (or "King," depending on the monarch), is more than just a song; it's a symbol of national identity and loyalty to the Crown. Its origins are a bit murky, but it gained popularity in the mid-18th century, particularly during the Jacobite rebellions when displays of patriotism were crucial. The words themselves are a prayer for the monarch's well-being and a declaration of support for the nation. The opening lines are particularly important as they set the tone for the entire anthem. "God Save the Queen" begins by directly addressing God, asking for the monarch's salvation and continued reign. The next two words are "Gracious" and "Noble," which are used to describe the Queen. These words were specifically chosen to reflect the perceived virtues and qualities of the monarch, emphasizing her kindness and high moral standing. While words like "Royal" and "Majesty" are certainly associated with the monarchy, they don't appear in those crucial opening lines, making "Gracious" and "Noble" the correct answer.
