Queen Victoria reigned for over 63 years, from 1837 until her death in 1901. Her reign is known as the Victorian era, a period of great social and industrial change in Britain. Think of inventions like the telephone and the expansion of the British Empire â€“ all happening under Victoria! Before 2015, she held the record as the longest-reigning British monarch. Now, while Elizabeth I was a very important monarch in the 16th century, and Elizabeth II has now surpassed Victoria, it was Victoria who held the record for the longest reign *until* September 9, 2015. Mary, while a significant queen, simply did not reign for a comparable length of time. So, when you think of a long and impactful reign before our current Queen, Victoria is the name to remember.
