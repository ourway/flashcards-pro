The 'Divine Right of Kings' was a political and religious doctrine asserting that a monarch's authority to rule came directly from God, not from any earthly authority, including the people, the aristocracy, or even the Church. This idea gained prominence in England, particularly during the reigns of the Stuart monarchs in the 17th century. Kings like James I and Charles I strongly believed in this divine mandate, using it to justify their absolute power and resist challenges from Parliament. The belief was that because God had chosen them, they were accountable only to God, and any attempt to limit their power was seen as defying God's will. So, when you see "The King was appointed by God," that's the core of the Divine Right of Kings â€“ the idea that their legitimacy stemmed from a higher power, giving them supreme authority. While some might think it reduced the power of nobles or increased Parliament's power, the Divine Right actually aimed to concentrate power solely in the hands of the monarch, appointed by God.
