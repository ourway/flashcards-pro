The Spanish Armada refers to a massive fleet of ships sent by Spain to invade England in 1588. Think of it as Spain's ambitious attempt to conquer England and restore Catholicism. Back in the 16th century, Spain was a major European power, and England, under Queen Elizabeth I, was a rising Protestant nation. Tensions were high! The Spanish Armada, a huge collection of warships, set sail with the aim of landing troops and overthrowing Elizabeth. While the term "armada" can sometimes be used more generally to describe a large military force, in this historical context, it specifically refers to this naval fleet. The Armada's defeat was a turning point in history, marking the decline of Spanish power and the rise of England as a major naval force. So, while an army is made up of people, the Spanish Armada was all about the ships!
