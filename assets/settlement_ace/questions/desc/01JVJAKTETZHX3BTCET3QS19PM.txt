The Battle of Waterloo in 1815 was a pivotal moment in European history, marking the final defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte. After a period of exile, Napoleon had returned to power in France, threatening the established order. European powers, including Britain, formed a coalition to confront him. The battle itself took place near Waterloo, in present-day Belgium. While several forces were involved in the victory, including Prussian troops, the overall command of the allied forces rested with Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington. He was a seasoned military leader, famous for his campaigns in the Peninsular War against Napoleon in Spain and Portugal. Wellington's strategic brilliance and the steadfastness of his troops were crucial in holding the line against Napoleon's attacks until the Prussian army arrived to reinforce them. While Nelson was a celebrated naval hero, he died at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, long before Waterloo. Henry VII was an important Tudor monarch, but he lived centuries before Napoleon. Louis XIV was a French king, not involved in fighting Napoleon. So, the Duke of Wellington is the correct answer because he was the commander who led the allied forces to victory at Waterloo.
