The term "The Restoration" is often misunderstood, but it's crucial to remember what was actually being "restored." This period, which began in 1660, refers specifically to the restoration of the English monarchy after a period of republican rule under Oliver Cromwell. After Cromwell's death, there was a power vacuum, and ultimately, Charles II was invited back from exile to take the throne. So, "The Restoration" signifies the return of the king, the royal court, and the traditional system of government. While the Church of England was also re-established during this time, the term itself doesn't primarily denote a revival of Catholicism. In fact, Charles II, though suspected of Catholic sympathies, maintained the Anglican Church as the official church. The idea that it refers to a 15th-century revival of Catholicism is incorrect because the Restoration happened much later, in the 17th century, and focused on the monarchy, not a Catholic resurgence.
