Diwali, often called the Festival of Lights, is a major religious festival originating in India with deep roots in both Hinduism and Sikhism. The festival symbolizes the spiritual victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. For Hindus, Diwali is associated with the return of deities Rama and Sita to Ayodhya after a 14-year exile, celebrated by lighting lamps to guide their way. Sikhs celebrate Diwali as Bandi Chhor Divas, commemorating the release of Guru Hargobind, the sixth Sikh Guru, from imprisonment in the 17th century. The Guru was released from Gwalior Fort along with 52 other princes whom he had arranged to be freed. The Golden Temple in Amritsar is specially illuminated on this day. While Buddhism shares some cultural overlap with Hinduism, and Islam is a distinct religion with its own festivals, Diwali is specifically a celebration observed by those of the Sikh and Hindu faiths, making that the correct answer.
