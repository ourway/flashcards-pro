The Canterbury Tales, a cornerstone of English literature, paints a vivid picture of medieval society through the stories of pilgrims journeying to Canterbury Cathedral. Now, what makes this work so distinct is its structure. Instead of being a straightforward prose narrative like a novel, Geoffrey Chaucer chose to tell these tales primarily through poetry. Think of it like this: each pilgrim tells their story in verse, using rhythm and rhyme. While there are some prose sections, the vast majority of the work is written in poetic form, specifically Middle English verse. This was a common form for storytelling at the time, adding a layer of artistry and memorability to the tales. So, while the pilgrims might crack jokes or tell stories that resemble fables, the overarching form of the Canterbury Tales is undeniably poems, making it a collection of verse narratives rather than a novel or a series of jokes.
