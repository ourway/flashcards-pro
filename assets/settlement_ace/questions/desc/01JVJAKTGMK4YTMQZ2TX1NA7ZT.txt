The Scottish Parliament, located in Edinburgh, is designed to be accessible and open to the public. Since its establishment in 1999, after a referendum in 1997 where the Scottish people voted for devolution, the Parliament has aimed to be transparent and engaging. A key part of this is allowing visitors to witness the democratic process firsthand. You can indeed book tickets for debates, committee meetings, and arrange tours through their visitor services. These tours offer insights into the building's architecture, the history of Scottish devolution, and the workings of the parliamentary system. So, the statement is true because the Scottish Parliament actively encourages public engagement through scheduled visits and tours, making it easy for anyone interested to learn more about Scottish governance. It's a deliberate effort to connect the public with their elected representatives.
