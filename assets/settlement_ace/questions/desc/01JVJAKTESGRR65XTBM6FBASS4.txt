The UN Security Council is a really important part of the United Nations, which was formed after World War II in 1945 to try and prevent future global conflicts. Think of it as the UN's main tool for maintaining international peace and security. Now, the Security Council has 15 member states in total. Five of these are permanent members: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These five have a special power called the "veto," which means they can block any Security Council resolution. The other 10 members are elected by the UN General Assembly for two-year terms. So, while the UN itself has many more member countries, the Security Council, the body responsible for addressing immediate threats to world peace, is specifically composed of 15 nations. It's easy to get confused with the total number of UN member states, but remember the Security Council has a focused role and a smaller, more manageable size for quick decision-making.
