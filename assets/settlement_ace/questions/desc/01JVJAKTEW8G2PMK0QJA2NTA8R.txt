The United Nations, or UN, was established in 1945 in the aftermath of World War II, a conflict that brought unimaginable devastation to the world. The primary motivation for creating the UN was to prevent such a global catastrophe from ever happening again. Think of it as a global club where countries come together to talk things out instead of resorting to violence. So, the fundamental goal is all about maintaining peace and security on an international scale. The UN works to achieve this through diplomacy, peacekeeping operations, and promoting cooperation on various global issues. While the UN does address trade and other issues, its core mission, born from the ashes of war, is to prevent conflict and foster a more peaceful world. The other options simply don't align with this central purpose; the UN has no authority over the EU's decisions, nor does it promote dictatorship, which is the antithesis of its values.
