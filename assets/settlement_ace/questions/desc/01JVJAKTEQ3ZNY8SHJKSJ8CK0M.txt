The Magna Carta, sealed in 1215, is a cornerstone of British legal history and a vital step towards the parliamentary democracy you'll experience in the UK today. Think of it as a really old agreement, forced upon King John by a group of rebellious barons. Before the Magna Carta, the king was pretty much seen as above the law, able to do as he pleased. The barons, tired of his arbitrary rule and heavy taxes, demanded a written guarantee of their rights. The key thing the Magna Carta did was establish the principle that everyone, even the monarch, is subject to the law. It limited the king's power, preventing him from, say, imprisoning people without a trial or seizing their property without justification. While it primarily protected the rights of the barons, its principles were gradually extended to all free men. So, the idea that the king was *not* above the law is precisely what the Magna Carta was all about, making the statement that it established this principle absolutely true. It's a foundational document for the concept of the rule of law, which is still central to the British legal system.
