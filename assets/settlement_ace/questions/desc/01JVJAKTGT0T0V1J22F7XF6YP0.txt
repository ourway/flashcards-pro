Mother's Day in the UK has an interesting history, quite different from the American version celebrated in May. It evolved from a religious tradition called "Mothering Sunday," where people would return to their 'mother' church â€“ the main church or cathedral of the area, or the church where they were baptized. Servants, who often lived far from their families, were given the day off to visit their mothers and their home church. Over time, this religious observance blended with secular customs, becoming a day to honour all mothers. Because Easter is a movable feast, determined by the lunar calendar, Mothering Sunday also moves. It's specifically set as the fourth Sunday in Lent, which is always three weeks before Easter Sunday. So, while it might be tempting to think of it as being closer to Easter, the historical roots in Lent and the fixed timing relative to Easter Sunday make three weeks before the correct answer. This ensures it falls within the Lenten period of reflection and preparation before the Easter celebrations.
