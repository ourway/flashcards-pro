The establishment of the Northern Ireland Parliament in 1922 is deeply rooted in the complex history of Irish nationalism and British rule. For centuries, Ireland was under British control, leading to growing demands for independence. By the early 20th century, this movement gained significant momentum. However, the predominantly Protestant population in the north-east of Ireland, largely concentrated in Ulster, desired to remain part of the United Kingdom. This clash of aspirations led to the Government of Ireland Act in 1920, which proposed dividing Ireland into two self-governing entities: Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. While Southern Ireland eventually became the independent Irish Free State, later the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland chose to remain within the UK. The Northern Ireland Parliament was then officially set up in 1922 to govern the six counties that comprised Northern Ireland, marking a pivotal moment in Irish history and solidifying the partition of the island. The other dates are incorrect because they fall outside the period when the partition of Ireland was actively being legislated and implemented.
