The Commonwealth is all about countries working together, and at its heart are some really important principles. Think of it as a club where everyone agrees to play by the same rules. Two of the biggest rules are democracy and the rule of law. Democracy means that the people get to choose their leaders, usually through elections, and everyone has a voice. The rule of law means that everyone, from the Prime Minister to the person on the street, is subject to and equal before the law. No one is above it! This ensures fairness and prevents those in power from abusing their position. The Commonwealth grew out of the British Empire, and these values were seen as a way to build a better, more equitable relationship between member states. While other values are important, democracy and the rule of law are specifically highlighted as core principles that guide the Commonwealth's work and are essential for maintaining a fair and just society within its member nations.
