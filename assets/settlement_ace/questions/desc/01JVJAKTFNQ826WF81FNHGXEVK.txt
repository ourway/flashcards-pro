Queen Elizabeth I, who reigned from 1558 to 1603, inherited a religiously divided England. Her father, Henry VIII, had broken with the Catholic Church to establish the Church of England, and her half-sister, Mary I, was a staunch Catholic who persecuted Protestants. Elizabeth, a Protestant, sought a middle ground, a "via media," to bring stability to the country. She re-established the Church of England but with a more moderate approach than some radical Protestants desired. Her religious settlement, outlined in the Act of Supremacy and the Act of Uniformity, aimed to create a church that both Catholics and Protestants could accept. While Catholics weren't entirely happy, and some plots against her were hatched, she didn't actively persecute them on a large scale simply for their beliefs, especially if they outwardly conformed. This balancing act was crucial for maintaining peace and preventing further religious conflict during her long and influential reign. So, while she was Protestant, her policy was about finding a compromise rather than outright persecution.
