The Bill of Rights, passed in 1689, is a cornerstone of British constitutional history. Think of it as a reaction to decades of tension between the monarchy and Parliament, particularly during the reigns of the Stuart kings. Before the Bill of Rights, monarchs often tried to rule without consulting Parliament or respecting its decisions. This led to conflict and ultimately, the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which saw James II deposed. The Bill of Rights was essentially the terms and conditions Parliament set for William and Mary to take the throne. It confirmed that the monarch couldn't suspend laws, raise taxes, or maintain a standing army in peacetime without Parliament's consent. It also guaranteed free elections, freedom of speech within Parliament, and the right to petition the monarch. So, the statement is true because the Bill of Rights fundamentally shifted the balance of power, establishing parliamentary supremacy and setting clear limits on what the king or queen could do. It's a key document in understanding how the UK's democratic system evolved.
