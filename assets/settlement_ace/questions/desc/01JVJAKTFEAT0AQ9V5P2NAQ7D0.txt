The year 1815 was a pivotal moment in European history, marking the end of Napoleon Bonaparte's ambition to dominate the continent. After a period of exile, Napoleon returned to power in France, sparking renewed conflict. The climactic battle that sealed his fate was the Battle of Waterloo. Now, while Admiral Nelson is a celebrated British naval hero, famous for his victory at the Battle of Trafalgar, he died in 1805, a decade before Waterloo. The Duke of Cornwall is a title, not a military leader. The commander who led the Allied forces to victory against Napoleon at Waterloo was Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington. Wellington's strategic brilliance and the resilience of his troops, combined with Prussian support, resulted in Napoleon's final defeat. This victory cemented Wellington's place as one of Britain's greatest military figures. So, when you think of the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, remember the Duke of Wellington as the key leader who brought about that historic outcome.
