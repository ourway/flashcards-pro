Okay, let's talk about the electoral register. This is basically the list of everyone who's registered to vote in the UK. Now, think about how much people's lives change in a year. People move houses, turn 18 and become eligible to vote, or sadly, pass away. That's why it's so important to keep the register up-to-date. In the UK, local councils are responsible for maintaining the electoral register, and they conduct an annual canvass, usually around September and October. They send out forms to every household to check who is eligible to vote and living at that address. This ensures that the register is as accurate as possible before it's published. So, while elections themselves might not happen every year, the process of updating the electoral register *does* happen annually, specifically in September and October, to reflect those changes in residency and eligibility. The other options, like every two, four, or five years, would simply be too infrequent to maintain an accurate record of eligible voters.
