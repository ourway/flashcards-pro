The UK legal system is built upon the principles of human rights and individual freedom, which means certain practices, even if they are part of a cultural tradition elsewhere, are illegal here. Female Genital Mutilation, or FGM, is a deeply harmful practice that violates a woman's bodily autonomy and right to health. It has been illegal in the UK since 1985, with laws strengthened in 2003 to increase penalties for those involved. Similarly, forced marriage, where someone is married without their free and full consent, is also against the law. The UK government takes a strong stance against forced marriage, offering support and protection to victims, and prosecuting perpetrators. Both FGM and forced marriage are considered serious human rights abuses, and the UK's commitment to protecting individual freedoms means they are unequivocally illegal. It's important to remember that while cultural traditions are valued, they cannot override fundamental human rights as protected by UK law.
