Imagine a time long before modern medicine, when a mysterious and terrifying illness swept across Europe. That was the Black Death, a devastating plague that peaked in Britain around 1348. It wasn't just a bad flu; it was caused by a bacterium called Yersinia pestis, spread by fleas living on rodents. The conditions in medieval towns and cities – cramped housing, poor sanitation – were perfect for the disease to spread like wildfire. The name "Black Death" comes from the dark blotches that appeared on the skin of the infected. It's estimated that it killed between 30% and 60% of Europe's population, and Britain was hit hard. So, when we talk about a plague in 1348 that wiped out a huge chunk of the population in England, Wales, and Scotland, we're talking about the infamous Black Death. The other colour options are simply incorrect and have no historical basis in describing this pandemic.
