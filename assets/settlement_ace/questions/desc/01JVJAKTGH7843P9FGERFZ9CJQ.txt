The National Assembly for Wales, now known as the Welsh Parliament or Senedd, plays a crucial role in Welsh governance. It's responsible for making laws on devolved matters, meaning areas where power has been transferred from the UK Parliament in Westminster to Wales. Think of things like education, health, and the environment. To effectively represent the people of Wales and make informed decisions on these important issues, the Assembly needs a sufficient number of elected members. That number is 60. These Assembly Members, or AMs, are elected to represent different constituencies and regions across Wales. While other numbers might seem plausible, 60 is the specific number established to ensure proper representation and effective functioning of the Welsh Parliament. It's a number set to balance local representation with the overall size and efficiency of the legislative body.
