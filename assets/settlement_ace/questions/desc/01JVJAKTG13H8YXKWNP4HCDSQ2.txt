Okay, let's talk about what you need when you get a new car in the UK. Think about it – the government wants to make sure everyone on the road is safe and paying their fair share. That's why car insurance and road tax, now often called Vehicle Excise Duty, are absolutely essential from day one. You can't legally drive a car without them. Seat belts are also a must-have; they're a fundamental safety feature, and it's illegal for manufacturers to sell cars without them. Now, the MOT test is different. It's a yearly safety check for vehicles over a certain age – currently, that age is three years. The purpose of the MOT is to ensure that older vehicles are still roadworthy and meet minimum safety and environmental standards. So, a brand-new car is exempt from needing an MOT for its first three years, making it the odd one out in this list.
