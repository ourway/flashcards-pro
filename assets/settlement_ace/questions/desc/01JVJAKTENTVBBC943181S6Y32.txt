'Prime Minister's Questions,' often called PMQs, is a key part of the UK's parliamentary process. It's a weekly opportunity for Members of Parliament, or MPs, to directly question the Prime Minister on any topic. This tradition developed over time, evolving from earlier forms of parliamentary questioning. The modern format, as we know it, really took shape in the 1960s. It's held every Wednesday when Parliament is in session. This weekly frequency is important because it ensures regular accountability and allows for scrutiny of the government's actions and policies. While it might seem like the Prime Minister is constantly answering questions, it's not a daily event. Daily questioning would be impractical and wouldn't allow for considered responses. Similarly, longer intervals like every two weeks or once a month wouldn't provide the necessary level of regular oversight. So, the weekly occurrence of PMQs strikes a balance, making it a consistent and crucial element of British political life.
