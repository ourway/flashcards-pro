The English Civil War, a tumultuous period in the 17th century, saw England divided between those who supported the monarchy and those who favored Parliament. King Charles I believed in the divine right of kings, leading to clashes with Parliament over power and taxation. Those who remained loyal to Charles I and the monarchy were known as Cavaliers. The term "Cavalier" originally had a derogatory meaning, implying they were unruly and arrogant, but the Royalists embraced it. Their image was one of flamboyant gentlemen, often depicted with long hair and elaborate clothing. On the other side were the Parliamentarians, nicknamed "Roundheads" because they typically had shorter hair, a sign of their more austere Puritan beliefs. So, while Roundheads were the opposition, Cavaliers were specifically those who fought for the King during this intense period of British history. Rotten Boroughs were a later phenomenon related to parliamentary representation, and Suffragettes were part of the much later movement for women's voting rights.
