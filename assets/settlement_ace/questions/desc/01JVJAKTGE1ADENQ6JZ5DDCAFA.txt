Okay, let's talk about pensions and taxes in the UK. The UK operates on a system where income is generally subject to taxation, and that includes pension income. Think of it this way: during your working life, you often receive tax relief on the money you contribute to your pension. This is designed to encourage saving for retirement. However, because you received tax relief on the way in, the government taxes the pension income when you start drawing it out during retirement. Most people can take 25% of their pension tax-free, but the remaining 75% is treated as taxable income, just like your salary would be. This means it's subject to income tax, and the amount you pay depends on your total income and tax bands. So, while it might seem unfair to pay tax on money you've already saved, it's part of the overall system of tax relief and income taxation in the UK.
