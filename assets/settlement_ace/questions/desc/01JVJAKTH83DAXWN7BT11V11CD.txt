Okay, so the House of Commons and the House of Lords are the two parts of the UK Parliament. Think of the House of Commons as the primary decision-making body. These are the elected representatives, the people you vote for in a general election. The House of Lords, on the other hand, is made up of appointed members, including life peers, some hereditary peers, and bishops of the Church of England. Historically, the Lords had more power, but over time, especially with the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949, the power shifted towards the Commons. These acts significantly limited the Lords' ability to block legislation passed by the Commons. While the Lords can debate, suggest amendments, and delay bills, the Commons can ultimately overrule them if they insist on passing a law. It doesn't happen often because there's usually a lot of negotiation and compromise between the two houses. The other options are incorrect because Peers are members of the House of Lords, the Queen has a ceremonial role, and the Prime Minister leads the government but isn't a legislative body.
