The Tower of London has served many purposes throughout its long history, from a royal palace to a prison. But today, it's most famous for being the home of the Crown Jewels. These aren't just any old jewels; they are the symbols of the British monarchy, used in coronations and other important state occasions. Think of the St. Edward's Crown, used to crown monarchs since 1661, or the Sovereign's Orb and Sceptre. Because of their immense historical and symbolic value, as well as their monetary worth, they need to be kept extremely safe. The Tower, with its thick walls, Beefeater guards, and state-of-the-art security systems, provides that security. It's been their protected home since the 17th century, after a period of being held in Westminster Abbey. So, while it might seem like something out of a movie, it's absolutely true that these priceless treasures are securely housed within the Tower of London.
