The Grand National is synonymous with horse racing, and it's one of the most famous steeplechase events in the world. Steeplechase means the horses have to jump over obstacles. This particular race has a long and storied history, dating back to 1839, and takes place annually at Aintree Racecourse near Liverpool. It's a grueling test of endurance for both horse and rider, covering a distance of over four miles and featuring challenging fences like Becher's Brook and The Chair, which are notorious for causing upsets. The Grand National is a huge event in British culture, attracting a massive television audience and significant betting activity. While football, golf, and cricket are all popular sports in the UK, they have no connection to the Grand National. It's all about the horses!
