Okay, let's explore the Stone Age inhabitants of Britain. Imagine Britain thousands of years ago, long before cities, villages, or even farms. This was the Stone Age, a vast period stretching from around 800,000 BC to 2300 BC. During this time, people didn't cultivate crops or domesticate animals for food. Instead, they relied entirely on what nature provided. These early Britons were nomadic, meaning they moved from place to place, following herds of animals like deer and wild boar, and gathering edible plants, berries, and nuts. Their survival depended on their skills in hunting with primitive tools made of stone and bone, and their knowledge of the natural environment. So, the initial inhabitants of Britain during the Stone Age were hunter-gatherers. While later periods saw the development of farming, that wasn't the case at the very beginning. Pirates are a much later phenomenon, and peasants are associated with settled agricultural societies, which didn't exist in the early Stone Age.
