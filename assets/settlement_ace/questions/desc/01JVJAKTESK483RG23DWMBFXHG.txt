Diwali, a significant festival originating in India, is celebrated by Hindus, Sikhs, and Jains across the world. The name "Diwali" itself comes from the Sanskrit word "Deepavali," which literally translates to "row of lights." The festival marks the victory of good over evil, light over darkness, and knowledge over ignorance. This triumph is symbolized by the lighting of diyas (oil lamps) and candles in homes and streets. The glow represents dispelling the darkness of ignorance and embracing enlightenment. While Diwali is undoubtedly a joyous occasion filled with happiness and celebrated around the autumn equinox, it's the visual and symbolic prominence of light that gives it the widely recognized name "Festival of Lights." The other options, while perhaps reflecting aspects of the celebration, don't capture the core, defining characteristic of Diwali, which is the illumination and symbolic representation of light overcoming darkness.
