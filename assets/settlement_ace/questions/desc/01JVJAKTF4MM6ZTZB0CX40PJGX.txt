The term "The Restoration" in British history refers to the period that began in 1660 when the monarchy was brought back to England with Charles II becoming king. Before this, England had been a republic under Oliver Cromwell following the English Civil War. People were tired of the strict Puritan rule, so there was a lot of support for bringing back the monarchy. Charles II, who had been in exile, was invited to return and take the throne. While religion was certainly a factor during this time, with Charles II himself having Catholic sympathies, the primary focus of the Restoration was the restoration of the English monarchy, along with the traditional social and political structures that had been disrupted during the republican period. So, while religious tensions existed, the term "The Restoration" specifically describes the return of the king, not a resurgence of Roman Catholicism.
