Okay, let's talk about smoking in public places in the UK. For a long time, smoking was a very common sight everywhere, from pubs to offices. But as scientific evidence grew about the dangers of secondhand smoke, attitudes began to change. The key turning point was the introduction of smoke-free legislation. England was actually one of the last parts of the UK to bring in a comprehensive ban. Scotland led the way in 2006, followed by Wales and Northern Ireland in 2007. Finally, England followed suit in July 2007. This legislation made it against the law to smoke in virtually all enclosed public places and workplaces. This includes pubs, restaurants, offices, and public transport. The aim was to protect workers and the public from the harmful effects of passive smoking. So, while you might remember seeing people light up indoors in older movies or TV shows, those days are long gone. It's now firmly against the law.
