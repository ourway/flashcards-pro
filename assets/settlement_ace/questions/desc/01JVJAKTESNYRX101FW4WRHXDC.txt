The Union Flag, often called the Union Jack, is a powerful symbol representing the United Kingdom's history and unity. It's not just a random design; it's a combination of the flags of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The flag of England features the red cross of St. George, their patron saint, who famously slew a dragon. Scotland's flag displays the white saltire, or diagonal cross, of St. Andrew, who is said to have been crucified on a cross of that shape. The final piece is the red saltire of St. Patrick, representing Ireland. While Wales is part of the UK, its patron saint, St. David, and his symbol are not represented on the Union Flag. So, the Union Flag is a visual representation of the union of these three nations under one flag, making St. Patrick, St. George, and St. Andrew the saints whose crosses make up its design.
