Okay, let's talk about those early raiders of Britain! While the Romans, Anglo-Saxons, and Normans all played significant roles in shaping Britain, they came as conquerors and settlers, not just raiders. Think of the Vikings as the original "hit-and-run" experts of the sea. They began their raids around AD 789, targeting coastal monasteries and settlements. These weren't full-scale invasions like the Romans or Normans; instead, they were quick, brutal attacks to seize valuables like silver and slaves. The Anglo-Saxons had already settled in Britain for centuries by this point, and the Norman Conquest was still a few hundred years away in 1066. The Vikings' longships allowed them to navigate rivers and strike inland, making them a constant threat. These raids marked the beginning of a long period of Viking influence in Britain, eventually leading to Viking settlements and even kings. So, when you think of early raiders, remember the Vikings and their swift, sea-based attacks.
