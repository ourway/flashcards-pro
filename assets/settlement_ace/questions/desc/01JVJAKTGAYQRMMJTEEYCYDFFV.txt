Okay, let's talk about the UK's constitution. Unlike the United States, which has a single, codified document, the UK operates without a single written constitution. Instead, the British constitution is more of a collection of statutes, court judgments, conventions, and historical documents. Think of it as a living, breathing set of principles that has evolved over centuries. Landmark documents like Magna Carta from 1215, which limited the power of the monarch, and the Bill of Rights of 1689, which established parliamentary supremacy, are key parts of this unwritten constitution. So, while there are many written laws and documents that contribute to how the UK is governed, there's no single document called "The Constitution." This is why the statement that the UK has a written constitution is false. It's a common misconception because many countries do have a single, written document, but the UK's system is unique in its reliance on tradition and precedent.
