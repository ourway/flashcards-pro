The National Lottery is a hugely popular form of gambling in the UK, established in 1994. It's run by a private company, Camelot, but is licensed and regulated by the government. The age at which people can participate in activities like gambling is always a balance between personal freedom and protecting vulnerable individuals. For many years, the legal age to buy lottery tickets or scratchcards was 16. This was in line with other activities like buying certain types of fireworks or entering into some types of employment. However, in 2021, the government raised the minimum age to play the National Lottery to 18. This change was made to align the lottery with other forms of gambling, like casinos and online betting, where the minimum age was already 18. So, while historically the answer was 16, it's now 18. It's important to stay updated on these changes as laws can evolve!
