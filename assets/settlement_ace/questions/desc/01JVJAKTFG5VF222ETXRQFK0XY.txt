Okay, let's break down the local government structure of London. When we talk about London, it's easy to think of it as one giant entity, but it's actually made up of many smaller administrative areas. These are called local authorities, and they're responsible for things like schools, social services, libraries, and collecting council tax. Think of them as mini-governments within the larger city. Now, the key thing to remember is that London is divided into 32 London boroughs, plus the City of London itself, which is a separate entity with its own unique governance. So, when you add them all up, that gives you a total of 33 local authorities. It's a common mistake to underestimate the number because people often only think of the most famous boroughs, but each one plays a vital role in managing its local area.
