Jane Austen is one of England's most beloved novelists, famous for her witty social commentary and insightful portrayals of English middle-class life during the Regency period, roughly from 1811 to 1820. Her novels often explore themes of love, marriage, and social status. "Sense and Sensibility," published in 1811, perfectly encapsulates these themes. The novel tells the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, who represent the contrasting qualities of reason ("sense") and emotion ("sensibility"). The title itself is a direct reflection of the core themes explored in the book, making it a memorable and easily identifiable work by Austen. While "Oliver Twist" was written by Charles Dickens, and "Far from the Madding Crowd" by Thomas Hardy, and "Our Man in Havana" by Graham Greene, "Sense and Sensibility" is the only option penned by Jane Austen.
