Life peers are members of the House of Lords who are appointed for their lifetime, based on their individual merit and contributions to society. The key thing to remember is that the UK strives to be inclusive and representative of its diverse population. Historically, the House of Lords was dominated by hereditary peers and members of the Church of England, but reforms have gradually opened it up. Today, life peerages are awarded to individuals from all walks of life, regardless of their religious beliefs. While some life peers may be Christian, there's absolutely no requirement or obligation for them to be so. People of other faiths, or no faith at all, can and do become life peers. The idea that only Christians are allowed is simply untrue and goes against the modern principles of equality and diversity that underpin the UK's parliamentary system.
