Okay, let's talk about pilgrimages and poetry! The correct answer here is "The Canterbury Tales" because it's a collection of stories framed around a group of pilgrims traveling together. Geoffrey Chaucer, often called the father of English literature, wrote it in the late 14th century. Now, a pilgrimage is a journey to a sacred place, and in this case, the destination is Canterbury Cathedral, a very important religious site in England. The pilgrims are going to visit the shrine of Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was murdered there in 1170. What makes "The Canterbury Tales" so special is that Chaucer uses this pilgrimage as a way to bring together a diverse group of characters from all walks of medieval life â€“ knights, millers, nuns, pardoners, you name it! Each character tells their own story along the way, giving us a fascinating glimpse into medieval society. The other options are famous works, but they don't involve a pilgrimage. "All the world's a stage" is from Shakespeare's play "As You Like It," "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is another Shakespearean play, and "Great Expectations" is a novel by Charles Dickens. So, while they're all great literature, they don't feature a group of people on a religious journey like "The Canterbury Tales" does.
