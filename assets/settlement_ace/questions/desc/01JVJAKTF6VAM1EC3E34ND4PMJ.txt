Lobbying and pressure groups are a really interesting part of how democracy works in the UK. These groups represent all sorts of interests, from environmental charities to business organizations, and they try to influence politicians and government policy. Now, it's important to understand that the relationship is a two-way street. While these groups definitely try to influence the government, the government doesn't actively try to influence *them*. The government needs to remain impartial and listen to all sides of an argument, not try to steer the opinions of these independent groups. It's more about the government listening to and considering the views of these groups, rather than trying to control them. So, while pressure groups are all about influencing the government, the government's role is to listen and make decisions based on a wide range of inputs, not to manipulate the groups themselves.
