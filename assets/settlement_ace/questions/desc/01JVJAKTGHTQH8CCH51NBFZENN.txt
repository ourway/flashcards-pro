Saint Patrick's Day, celebrated annually on March 17th, commemorates the patron saint of Ireland and the arrival of Christianity in Ireland. Patrick, believed to have lived in the fifth century, was a Romano-British Christian missionary who was captured and brought to Ireland as a slave. He later escaped and returned to Britain, but had a vision calling him back to Ireland. He's credited with converting much of Ireland to Christianity. The date, March 17th, is traditionally believed to be the date of his death. While St. Patrick's Day started as a religious feast day, it has evolved into a global celebration of Irish culture, marked by parades, traditional music, dancing, and of course, wearing green. So, while other dates might be significant for other reasons – like St. David's Day on March 1st or St. Andrew's Day on November 30th – March 17th is specifically and universally recognized as St. Patrick's Day.
