Okay, let's break down why Sir Robert Walpole is considered the first Prime Minister. In the early 18th century, the British political landscape was shifting. The monarch still held significant power, but Parliament was gaining influence. Walpole, a Whig politician, became the First Lord of the Treasury, effectively managing the government's finances, in 1721. Now, here's the key: while the *title* "Prime Minister" wasn't officially created, Walpole wielded the power and influence we associate with the role today. He was the king's chief advisor, he led the House of Commons, and he controlled government policy. Because he held this position for over 20 years, and because he was so influential, people started referring to him as the "Prime Minister," even though it wasn't an official title. So, while it wasn't a formal appointment, Walpole's long tenure and dominance in government led to him being widely regarded, both then and now, as Britain's first Prime Minister. It's a bit of a historical quirk, but it's why the statement is considered true.
