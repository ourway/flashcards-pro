Serving on a jury is a really important civic duty in the UK, and the system is designed to be as fair and impartial as possible. That's why jurors are chosen randomly. Think about it: if local authorities nominated people, there could be bias or favouritism. Asking nicely wouldn't work because jury service is compulsory if selected, unless you have a very good reason to be excused. And selecting by birth date would be completely arbitrary and unfair! Instead, the electoral register, which lists all eligible voters, is used as a pool. Names are then drawn at random, ensuring a cross-section of society is represented in the courtroom. This random selection helps to prevent any one group or individual from dominating the jury and ensures a more balanced and just outcome. Interestingly, until 1972, only property owners were eligible for jury service, but now it's open to almost everyone on the electoral register between 18 and 70.
