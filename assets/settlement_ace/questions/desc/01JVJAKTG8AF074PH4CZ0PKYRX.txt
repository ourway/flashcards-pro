The BBC, or British Broadcasting Corporation, is a unique institution in the UK, and a key part of its identity is its funding model. Unlike many commercial television stations around the world, the BBC doesn't rely on advertising revenue to keep running. Instead, it's primarily funded by what's called a television licence fee. This is a fee that almost every household in the UK has to pay if they watch or record live television programmes. This system was established early in the BBC's history, back in the 1920s, to ensure its independence from commercial pressures and political influence. The idea was that by being funded directly by the public, the BBC could focus on providing high-quality, informative, and entertaining programming without having to worry about attracting advertisers. So, the statement that the BBC finances its operations by selling advertising space during television programmes is false. While you might see BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the BBC, selling advertising space on its international channels, the core BBC channels in the UK remain ad-free, thanks to the licence fee.
