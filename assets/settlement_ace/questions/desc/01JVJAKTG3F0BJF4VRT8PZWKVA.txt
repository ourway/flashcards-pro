Okay, let's talk about British art! Britain has a rich artistic heritage, and knowing some key figures is important. When we think about prominent British artists, we're looking for individuals who've made significant contributions to visual arts like painting and sculpture. David Hockney is a fantastic example. He's a painter, draughtsman, printmaker, stage designer, and photographer, known for his vibrant colours and depictions of modern life, particularly in California and Yorkshire. He's been a major figure since the 1960s. Then there's Henry Moore, one of the most important sculptors of the 20th century. He's famous for his large-scale, abstract bronze sculptures, often depicting reclining human figures. His work can be found all over the world. While Andy Murray is a British sporting hero, a famous tennis player, and Sir Edward Elgar is a renowned composer of classical music, they both fall outside the realm of visual arts. So, Hockney and Moore are the correct choices because they are both highly influential and recognised visual artists from Britain.
