Alright, let's talk about Britain's earliest inhabitants. Way back in the Stone Age, which lasted for thousands of years, people didn't have farms or shops like we do today. Instead, they lived as hunter-gatherers. This means they moved around following herds of animals like deer and wild boar, which they hunted for food. They also gathered wild plants, berries, and nuts to supplement their diet. Think about it: no supermarkets existed! These early humans were completely reliant on what they could find in nature. They made tools from stone, hence the name "Stone Age," to help them hunt, build shelters, and prepare food. So, when we think about the very first people in Britain, it's accurate to picture them as hunter-gatherers, skillfully surviving in a wild and untamed landscape. It's easy to forget how long ago this was, but their way of life shaped the very beginnings of human history on the British Isles.
