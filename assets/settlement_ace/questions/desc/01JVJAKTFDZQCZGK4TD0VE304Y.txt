Okay, let's talk about the Welsh Assembly's law-making powers. Understanding this requires knowing a bit about devolution in the UK. Devolution is basically the transfer of power from the central government in Westminster to regional assemblies or parliaments. Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland all have devolved powers, but the extent of those powers varies. Initially, the Welsh Assembly, established in 1999, had less power than the Scottish Parliament. However, over time, its powers have increased significantly. The key thing to remember is that the Assembly doesn't have complete control over all areas of law. Instead, it has specific areas where it can make its own laws, tailored to the needs of Wales. Currently, the Welsh Assembly has the power to make laws in 20 specific areas. These areas cover a broad range of issues, including things like education, health, environment, economic development, and transport. So, while 5, 10, or 15 might sound plausible, the correct number reflecting the current scope of the Assembly's authority is 20.
