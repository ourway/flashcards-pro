The Industrial Revolution was a period of huge technological advancements that transformed Britain from a largely rural, agricultural society into an urban, industrial one. This didn't happen overnight, but the most significant changes really took off during the 18th and 19th centuries. Think about inventions like the steam engine, which was improved by James Watt in the late 1700s, and the rise of factories and mass production. These developments led to massive social and economic changes, including population growth in cities and new forms of transportation like railways. While there were earlier innovations, the 18th and 19th centuries were when these changes became widespread and truly revolutionized British life. The other options are too early; the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries were more associated with exploration, the Renaissance, and the early stages of scientific discovery, not the large-scale industrial transformation that defines the Industrial Revolution.
