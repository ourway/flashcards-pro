In the 19th century, Irish nationalism was on the rise, fueled by a desire for self-governance and an end to British rule. Several groups emerged advocating for varying degrees of independence. The Fenians, officially known as the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), were a particularly significant movement founded in 1858. Unlike some other groups who sought reform within the existing system, the Fenians were committed to achieving complete independence from the United Kingdom, even if it meant using armed rebellion. Their name comes from "fianna," legendary warriors of Irish mythology, symbolizing their militant approach. While other groups like the Quakers were known for their pacifism and social reform, and the Highlanders are associated with Scottish culture, the Fenians specifically aimed to establish an independent Irish republic through revolutionary means. The Suffragettes, on the other hand, were primarily focused on women's right to vote in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a different cause altogether. So, when you think of 19th-century Irish groups seeking full independence, the Fenians are the key historical actors to remember.
