Okay, here's an explanation of why it's false that Members of Parliament can only be reached by mail. In a modern democracy like the UK, effective communication between citizens and their elected representatives is absolutely vital. Think about it â€“ how can an MP truly represent their constituents if they're only getting information through letters? While traditional mail remains an option, limiting contact to just that would be incredibly inefficient and frankly, undemocratic in today's world. MPs need to be accessible to a wide range of people, and that means using all available channels. So, in addition to postal mail, you can contact your MP through email, phone calls to their office, in person at constituency surgeries (scheduled meetings), and even via social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook. The idea is to make it as easy as possible for people to voice their concerns and for MPs to stay informed about the issues affecting their communities. Relying solely on mail would be like going back to the 19th century!
