EU law, before Brexit, operated on a few different levels, each with its own specific function. Regulations are directly applicable in all member states the moment they come into force, meaning they don't need to be implemented by national governments. Think of them as instantly becoming part of UK law. Directives, on the other hand, set out a goal that all EU countries must achieve, but it's up to each country to decide how to achieve it through their own national laws. So, a directive might say "reduce pollution," and the UK would then create its own laws to make that happen. Framework Decisions were primarily used in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. They were similar to directives in that they required member states to take action, but they were specifically focused on criminal justice issues. Because all three – regulations, directives, and framework decisions – were distinct types of laws made by the EU, "all of these" is the correct answer. It's easy to get confused because they all work differently, but they were all part of the EU's legal toolkit.
