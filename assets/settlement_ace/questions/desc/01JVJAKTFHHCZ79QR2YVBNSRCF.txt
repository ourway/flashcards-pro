The Commonwealth is all about cooperation among countries that were mostly once part of the British Empire. Think of it as a club where everyone shares some common values and works together. While promoting peace and free trade are definitely good things, and the Commonwealth might be involved in those indirectly, its *main* focus is on helping member countries strengthen their democratic institutions and improve their citizens' lives. This includes things like fair elections, a strong legal system, and economic development. It's not about visa-free travel, which is more of a European Union thing. The Commonwealth provides assistance, shares best practices, and supports its members in achieving these goals. So, when you think of the Commonwealth, picture a group of nations collaborating to build stronger democracies and better living standards for their people.
