Okay, let's break down why Emily Watson is the actress who hasn't won an Oscar from that list. The Academy Awards, or Oscars, are given out annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to recognize excellence in cinematic achievements. Now, Tilda Swinton won Best Supporting Actress for her role in "Michael Clayton" in 2008. Dame Judi Dench, a titan of British theatre and film, secured her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in "Shakespeare in Love" back in 1999. Kate Winslet finally won Best Actress for "The Reader" in 2009 after several nominations. Emily Watson, while a highly respected and talented actress known for films like "Breaking the Waves" and "Hilary and Jackie," has received two Oscar nominations but hasn't yet taken home the award. It's easy to get confused because all of these actresses are incredibly accomplished, but only Swinton, Dench, and Winslet have that golden statue on their shelves.
