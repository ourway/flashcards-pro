The Bronze Age, spanning roughly from 2500 BC to 800 BC in Britain, gets its name because it was the period when people learned how to make bronze. This alloy, a mixture of copper and tin, was revolutionary. It allowed for stronger and more durable tools and weapons than the stone implements used before. Think about the iconic bronze axes, swords, and shields you might see in museums. These were the cutting-edge technology of the time! Now, while Bronze Age people were incredibly skilled metalworkers, mastering the techniques of smelting and casting bronze, glassmaking was a much later development. Glass production on a significant scale didn't really take off until the Roman period, centuries after the Bronze Age had ended. So, while it might be tempting to think of advanced civilizations mastering all sorts of crafts, glasswork simply wasn't a key skill or technology during the Bronze Age. Their expertise was firmly rooted in metal.
