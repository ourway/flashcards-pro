Okay, let's break down why disability and marital status are legally protected characteristics in the UK. The foundation for this protection lies in the Equality Act 2010. This act consolidates and strengthens previous anti-discrimination laws, aiming to create a fairer and more equal society. It identifies nine protected characteristics, meaning it's against the law to discriminate against someone because of them. Disability is included because everyone deserves equal opportunities, and the law ensures reasonable adjustments are made to accommodate people with disabilities in employment, education, and accessing services. Marital status is also protected because people shouldn't face prejudice or disadvantage based on whether they are married, single, divorced, or in a civil partnership. This prevents unfair treatment in areas like housing, employment benefits, and financial services. Now, things like eye colour or choice of car, while personal, aren't considered fundamental aspects of identity that have historically led to systemic discrimination, so they aren't covered by the Equality Act.
