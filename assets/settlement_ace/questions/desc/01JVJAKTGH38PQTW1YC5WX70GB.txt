HMS Victory is a really important piece of British naval history, and it's closely linked to Admiral Horatio Nelson, one of Britain's most celebrated military figures. Nelson commanded the ship during the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, where the British decisively defeated the French and Spanish fleets. This victory secured British naval supremacy for much of the 19th century, but sadly, Nelson was fatally wounded during the battle. Now, while Nelson is remembered all over the UK, HMS Victory is permanently docked in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. It's been carefully preserved as a museum ship, allowing visitors to step back in time and explore the decks where Nelson planned his strategies. So, while you might find memorials to Nelson in other places, Portsmouth is the only place you can actually visit his flagship, HMS Victory.
