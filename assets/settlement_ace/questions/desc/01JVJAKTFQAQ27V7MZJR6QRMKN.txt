The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a really important international treaty. It was created in the aftermath of World War II, when there was a strong desire to prevent similar atrocities from happening again. Think about the devastation and human rights abuses that occurred during the war â€“ countries wanted to establish a set of fundamental rights that everyone should have. The Council of Europe drafted the ECHR, and it was signed in Rome in 1950. The UK was one of the original signatories in 1950, showing its commitment to these core principles right from the start. While the UK formally adopted it in 1950, it didn't become part of UK law until the Human Rights Act of 1998. So, while the other dates might sound plausible, 1950 is the year the UK initially signed up to the Convention itself.
