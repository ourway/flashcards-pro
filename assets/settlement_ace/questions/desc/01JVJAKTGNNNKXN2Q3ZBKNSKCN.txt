The UK operates under a democratic system, and a cornerstone of any democracy is the principle of free and fair elections. This means that every eligible citizen has the right to vote according to their own conscience and preferences, without coercion or undue influence. Historically, the struggle for voting rights was a long and hard-fought battle, with movements like the Suffragettes fighting for women's suffrage in the early 20th century. These struggles emphasized the importance of individual autonomy in the voting process. Therefore, the idea that a party candidate or anyone else could force you to vote a certain way is completely antithetical to the democratic values that underpin the UK's political system. Your vote is your private decision, and no one has the right to dictate it. While political parties and candidates will try to persuade you to vote for them, ultimately, the choice rests solely with you.
