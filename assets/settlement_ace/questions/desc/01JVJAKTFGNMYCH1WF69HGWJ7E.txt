Lent is a significant period in the Christian calendar, observed by many denominations, including Catholics, Anglicans, and some Protestants. It's a time of reflection, repentance, and fasting, lasting for approximately six weeks leading up to Easter. The start of Lent is marked by Ash Wednesday. This day gets its name from the practice of placing ashes on the foreheads of worshippers as a symbol of mourning for their sins and mortality. The ashes are often made from the burning of palm branches used in the previous year's Palm Sunday celebrations. So, Ash Wednesday signifies the beginning of this period of spiritual preparation for Easter. Shrove Tuesday, sometimes known as Pancake Day, is actually the day *before* Lent begins, a day for feasting and using up rich foods before the fasting period. Good Friday, on the other hand, is the Friday *before* Easter, commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus.
