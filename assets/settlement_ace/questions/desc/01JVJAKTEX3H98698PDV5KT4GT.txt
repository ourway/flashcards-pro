The War of the Roses, a series of bloody civil wars for the throne of England, is a key event in British history. Think of it as a family feud on a grand scale! It pitted the House of Lancaster, symbolized by a red rose, against the House of York, symbolized by a white rose. Now, while the tension had been brewing for a while, the actual fighting kicked off in 1455. This is when the First Battle of St Albans took place, marking the official start of the conflict. The war was about who would control the English throne, with both houses claiming descent from Edward III. It was a turbulent period of shifting allegiances, battles, and ultimately, the rise of the Tudor dynasty. So, while the other dates might sound plausible, 1455 is the year that marks the beginning of this dramatic chapter in English history. Remember those roses blooming amidst the chaos of the mid-1400s!
