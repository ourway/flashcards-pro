Life peers are appointed to the House of Lords for their lifetime, and this is a key distinction. The House of Lords has evolved over centuries, and traditionally, many members inherited their titles, like Dukes or Earls. These are hereditary peers, and their titles pass down through their family line. However, life peerages were introduced in 1958 to bring expertise and experience into the Lords without creating hereditary rights. Think of it as a reward for exceptional service in a particular field. Because the whole point of a life peerage is to recognize an individual's contributions, the title is personal to them. It makes sense, then, that the title cannot be inherited. It ends with their death, ensuring that only those specifically chosen for their merit hold a seat in the Lords. A common misconception is that all titles are hereditary, but life peerages are a modern way to balance tradition with individual achievement.
