In the UK's parliamentary system, the goal of a general election is for one political party to win a majority of seats in the House of Commons. This means they have more Members of Parliament (MPs) than all other parties combined, allowing them to form a government and pass laws relatively easily. However, it's not uncommon for no single party to achieve this majority. This is called a hung parliament. When this happens, parties often negotiate to form a coalition. A coalition is essentially an agreement where two or more parties join together to have enough MPs to form a government. They usually agree on a shared policy platform and divide ministerial positions. This allows for stable governance even when no single party has overall control. Historically, we've seen examples like the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government from 2010 to 2015. So, the statement is true because forming a coalition is a standard and accepted way to create a functioning government when no single party wins a majority.
