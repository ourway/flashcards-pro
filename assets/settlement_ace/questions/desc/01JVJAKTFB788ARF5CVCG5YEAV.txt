Okay, let's talk about St. Augustine and the spread of Christianity in Britain. So, after the Romans left in the 5th century, different groups like the Anglo-Saxons came over and established their own kingdoms. Many of these Anglo-Saxon kingdoms initially followed their own pagan beliefs. Now, fast forward to 597 AD. Pope Gregory the Great sent Augustine, along with a group of missionaries, to England with the specific mission of converting the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. They landed in Kent, which is in the south of England. King Ã†thelberht of Kent was married to a Christian princess, Bertha, which made him more open to the new religion. Augustine established his base in Canterbury, which became the most important religious centre in England. From there, Christianity gradually spread to other parts of the country. So, while Christianity eventually reached all corners of Britain, the initial and crucial work of St. Augustine and his missionaries was concentrated in the south, specifically in Kent.
