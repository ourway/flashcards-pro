The Crimean War, fought from 1854 to 1856, is considered the first conflict to be extensively covered by the media. Before this, war reporting was limited and often heavily censored. However, during the Crimean War, journalists like William Howard Russell of *The Times* were on the ground, sending back vivid and often critical reports of the conditions faced by British soldiers. His reporting highlighted the logistical failures and appalling medical care, leading to public outcry and eventually reforms. This was made possible by advancements in technology like the telegraph, which allowed for faster transmission of news. While the Boer War also saw some media coverage, it was the Crimean War that truly established the role of the press in shaping public opinion about war. The World Wars were even more heavily covered, but the Crimean War was the groundbreaking moment that paved the way for that level of reporting.
