Okay, let's talk about the plague that ravaged Britain in the mid-14th century. This wasn't just any illness; it was a catastrophe that dramatically reshaped society. The correct name is the Black Death, and it arrived in Britain in 1348. The term "Black Death" likely comes from the dark blotches that appeared on the skin of the infected. It was a particularly virulent strain of bubonic plague, carried by fleas on rodents. Now, while terms like "Great Mortality," "Great Pestilence," and "Great Plague" might sound plausible, "Black Death" is the specific historical term used to refer to this outbreak. It's important to remember that the plague returned several times over the centuries, but the 1348 outbreak was particularly devastating, wiping out perhaps a third to half of the population. The impact was huge, leading to labor shortages, social upheaval, and even influencing the course of English history. So, while other plagues occurred, the one in 1348 is specifically known as the Black Death.
