Youth Courts in the UK deal with cases involving young people aged 10 to 17 who are accused of committing crimes. These courts operate with a focus on rehabilitation and the best interests of the child. Because of the sensitive nature of these cases and the need to protect the privacy and well-being of the young people involved, the public is generally not allowed to attend Youth Court hearings. This restriction helps to avoid stigmatizing the young person and allows them to focus on addressing their behaviour without the added pressure of public scrutiny. There are exceptions, such as for accredited members of the press, but even then, strict reporting restrictions are in place to prevent the identification of the young person. So, while open justice is a principle of the UK legal system, it's balanced with the need to safeguard vulnerable individuals, which is why the public isn't permitted in Youth Courts.
