Okay, let's talk about those beautiful stained-glass windows you see in places like York Minster! Think back to medieval times. Most people couldn't read or write, so how did they learn about the Bible and Christian teachings? That's where these windows came in. They were like giant, colourful comic books, visually telling stories from the Bible â€“ think Noah's Ark, the life of Jesus, or tales from the Old Testament. They also depicted the lives of Christian saints, showcasing their good deeds and miracles. These saints were important figures in the Christian faith, and their stories served as examples of how people should live. The vibrant colours and light shining through the glass made these stories even more captivating and memorable for the largely illiterate population. So, while the Vikings and Romans certainly left their mark on Britain, their stories weren't the ones being told through the stained glass of cathedrals; those windows were all about sharing Christian teachings.
