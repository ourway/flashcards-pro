William Shakespeare, often hailed as the greatest writer in the English language, lived during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Think of the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras â€“ that's his time! He's most famous for two main types of literary works: poems and plays. While he did write sonnets and longer narrative poems, it's his plays that truly cemented his place in history. Think of tragedies like *Hamlet* and *Macbeth*, comedies like *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, and histories like *Richard III*. These plays weren't just read; they were performed on stage, bringing his stories and characters to life. While TV dramas and newspaper articles are modern forms of media, Shakespeare predates them by centuries. His genius lies in his poetic language and dramatic storytelling, primarily expressed through poems and plays that continue to be studied and performed worldwide.
