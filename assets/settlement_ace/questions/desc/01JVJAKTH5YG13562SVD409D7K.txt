London's theatrical heart beats strongest in the West End. Think of it as London's equivalent to Broadway in New York City. This area, located in central London, has been a hub for entertainment and theatre since the 17th century. Over the years, numerous theatres sprung up, hosting everything from Shakespearean plays to modern musicals. The concentration of these venues, along with their rich history and the sheer number of performances happening nightly, makes the West End synonymous with theatre in London. The East End, while historically significant for other reasons like immigration and industry, doesn't have the same density or reputation for theatre. "The City" is London's financial district, and the term "South End" isn't generally used to refer to a specific area known for theatre. So, when you think of London and theatre, the West End is the place that immediately comes to mind.
