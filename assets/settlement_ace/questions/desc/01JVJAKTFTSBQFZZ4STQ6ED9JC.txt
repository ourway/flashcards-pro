Okay, let's talk about St. Paul's Cathedral. The original St. Paul's was actually destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, a devastating event that reshaped the city. After the fire, a massive rebuilding effort was needed, and that's where Sir Christopher Wren comes in. Wren was a brilliant architect, scientist, and mathematician, and he was appointed to oversee the rebuilding of not just St. Paul's, but also many other churches in London. He spent years designing and supervising the construction of the new St. Paul's, which is the iconic building we know today with its massive dome. So, while Gertrude Jekyll was a famous garden designer, Robert Adam a neoclassical architect, and Sir Edwin Lutyens designed many war memorials, none of them were involved in the rebuilding of St. Paul's. It was Wren's vision and expertise that brought this architectural masterpiece to life.
