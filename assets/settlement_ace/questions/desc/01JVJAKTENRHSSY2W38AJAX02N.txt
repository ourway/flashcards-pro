The Union Jack, officially known as the Union Flag, is the national flag of the United Kingdom. Its design is a combination of three older flags representing different parts of the UK. You've got the red cross of St. George, which represents England; the white saltire of St. Andrew, representing Scotland; and the red saltire of St. Patrick, representing Ireland. The flag was created in stages, starting with the union of England and Scotland in 1606, and then updated in 1801 when Ireland joined. So, while the UK has a national football team, and many national museums, the Union Jack is specifically the official flag that symbolizes the union of these nations. It's a visual representation of the UK's history and its constituent parts.
