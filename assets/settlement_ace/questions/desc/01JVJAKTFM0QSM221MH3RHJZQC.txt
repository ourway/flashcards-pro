The Enlightenment, primarily spanning the 18th century, was a truly transformative era in European history, and its influence spread far beyond. Think of it as a revolution of thought. Before this time, many aspects of life were dictated by tradition, religious dogma, or the authority of monarchs. The Enlightenment challenged these established norms. Philosophers and scientists began to emphasize reason, logic, and individual rights. Thinkers like John Locke, with his ideas about natural rights, and Isaac Newton, with his groundbreaking work in physics, were central figures. This period saw the rise of new political theories, advocating for things like democracy and separation of powers, and major scientific advancements based on empirical observation. So, when we talk about the Enlightenment, we're talking about a period where new ideas about politics, philosophy, and science emerged, fundamentally reshaping how people viewed the world and their place in it. The other options just don't fit the bill; it wasn't a time of complete peace, England's imperial rise was a longer process, and it definitely wasn't after WWII.
