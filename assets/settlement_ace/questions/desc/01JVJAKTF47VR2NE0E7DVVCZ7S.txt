The Tower of London is a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. It has played a prominent role in English history, serving variously as a royal palace, a prison, an armoury, and a treasury. It's most famously known for housing the Crown Jewels. Now, the Yeomen Warders, also known as "Beefeaters," are ceremonial guardians of the Tower of London. They're easily recognizable by their distinctive Tudor-style uniforms. The Beefeaters have a long history dating back to the 15th century, and they traditionally guarded prisoners and the Crown Jewels. Today, they primarily serve as tour guides, entertaining visitors with stories about the Tower's history, its famous prisoners, and even its resident ravens! So, when you think of Beefeaters and their captivating tales, the Tower of London is the place that immediately comes to mind. While Edinburgh Castle is a magnificent Scottish landmark and Big Ben is a famous clock tower, neither are associated with the Beefeaters.
