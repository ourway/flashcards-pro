William Shakespeare, arguably the most famous writer in the English language, penned numerous plays and sonnets filled with memorable lines that have become ingrained in popular culture. When we think of Shakespeare, certain phrases immediately spring to mind because they encapsulate universal themes and are beautifully written. 'All the world's a stage' from *As You Like It* is a powerful metaphor comparing life to a theatrical performance, with people playing different roles. Similarly, 'A rose by any other name would smell as sweet' from *Romeo and Juliet* explores the idea that names are arbitrary and don't change the essence of something. These verses are instantly recognizable and frequently quoted, demonstrating Shakespeare's lasting impact. The other options, while they might sound wise or poetic, are not actually lines from Shakespeare's plays. They lack the specific rhythm, imagery, and historical context that characterize his writing.
