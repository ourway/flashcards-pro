County Courts in the UK primarily deal with civil matters, meaning disputes between individuals or organisations rather than criminal offences against the state. Think of it as where you'd go to sort out disagreements over money, property, or family matters. Divorce proceedings fall squarely into this category, as they involve the legal dissolution of a marriage and often involve dividing assets and making arrangements for children. Similarly, breaches of contract – when one party fails to fulfil the terms of an agreement – are classic examples of civil disputes handled in County Courts. On the other hand, serious crimes like murder are heard in the Crown Court, which handles more severe criminal cases. Minor criminal offences, while dealt with in the court system, are typically heard in Magistrates' Courts. So, while all options involve the legal system, County Courts are specifically designed to resolve these kinds of personal and business disagreements, making divorce and breaches of contract the right fit.
