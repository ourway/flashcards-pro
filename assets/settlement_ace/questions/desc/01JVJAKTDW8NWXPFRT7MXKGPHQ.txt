Okay, so Britain and France have definitely tangled in a few wars throughout history! The idea that they've never been at war is simply not true. Think back to the Middle Ages and the Hundred Years' War, which actually lasted for 116 years, from 1337 to 1453. This was a series of conflicts between the English and French royal houses for control of the French throne. Key battles like Cr√©cy and Agincourt, where English archers famously dominated, are iconic moments from this period. Even after that, there were numerous other conflicts, including wars fought over colonial territories in the 17th and 18th centuries, and of course, the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century. While Britain and France have also been allies at times, particularly in the 20th and 21st centuries, their relationship has certainly not been without conflict. So, while it might be tempting to think of them as always being friendly neighbours, history tells a different story.
