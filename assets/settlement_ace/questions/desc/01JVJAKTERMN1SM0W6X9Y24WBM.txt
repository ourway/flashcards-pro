Life peers play a crucial role in the House of Lords, the upper chamber of the UK Parliament. Unlike hereditary peers who inherit their titles, life peers are appointed for their lifetime service and expertise in various fields, such as science, arts, business, or public service. Now, while the Prime Minister recommends individuals to become life peers, the actual authority to grant these peerages rests with the Monarch. Think of it like this: the Prime Minister suggests worthy candidates, but it's the Monarch who officially bestows the title. This is because the Monarch is the Head of State and the fount of honour in the UK. This power is exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister, but the formal act of creation is the Monarch's. So, while the Prime Minister is heavily involved in the process, the final decision and the act of appointment are carried out by the Monarch. It's a symbolic but important distinction reflecting the UK's constitutional monarchy.
