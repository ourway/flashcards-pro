The British parliamentary system has evolved over centuries, with a gradual shift in power from the monarchy and the aristocracy to the elected representatives of the people. The House of Lords, traditionally composed of hereditary peers and appointed life peers, once held significant power. However, reforms, particularly in the 20th century, have cemented the House of Commons as the dominant chamber. The Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 significantly limited the Lords' power to block legislation passed by the Commons. These acts were pivotal in establishing the principle of parliamentary supremacy, ensuring that the will of the elected representatives ultimately prevails. While the House of Lords can scrutinize, amend, and delay legislation, it cannot permanently block bills that have been passed by the House of Commons. This ensures that the government, which is accountable to the Commons, can implement its policies. So, the House of Commons always having the final say reflects the democratic principle of elected representatives holding ultimate authority.
