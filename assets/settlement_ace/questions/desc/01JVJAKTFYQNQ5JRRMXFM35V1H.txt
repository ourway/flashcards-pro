Henry Purcell, born in London around 1659, is considered one of the greatest English composers of all time. Think of him as the rock star of the late 17th century music scene in England! He lived during a fascinating period, the Restoration, when the monarchy was back after a period of being a republic, and the arts were flourishing. Purcell held several important musical positions throughout his life, including organist at Westminster Abbey and the Chapel Royal. He wrote a huge amount of music, from sacred choral works to instrumental pieces and, most famously, operas. His most famous work is probably the opera "Dido and Aeneas," a tragic love story set to beautiful music. So, given his prolific output of operas, anthems, and instrumental works, it's clear that Purcell's primary occupation was as a musician. While he might have appreciated a good garden or a well-written poem, his true passion and profession lay in creating music.
