Robert the Bruce is a towering figure in Scottish history, best known for leading Scotland during its war of independence against England in the early 14th century. Think of him as a Scottish national hero! He became King of Scotland in 1306, a time when the English monarchy was trying to assert control over Scotland. The struggle for independence was a long and bloody one, marked by famous battles like Bannockburn in 1314, where Bruce's forces decisively defeated the English army. This victory was a major turning point, eventually leading to Scotland's independence being formally recognised. So, while Wales, England, and Ireland all have their own rich histories and national heroes, Robert the Bruce is specifically linked to Scotland because he fought to establish Scotland as an independent nation. He's a key figure in Scottish identity and a symbol of their historical resistance to English rule.
