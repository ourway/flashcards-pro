Golf's roots are firmly planted in 15th-century Scotland. While the exact origins are debated, most historians agree that the modern game evolved from a pastime played on the eastern coast of Scotland, near the town of St Andrews. Imagine shepherds using their crooks to hit stones into rabbit holes â€“ that's the kind of activity that likely led to golf. By the mid-15th century, golf had become so popular that King James II actually banned it temporarily because it was distracting men from archery practice, which was crucial for national defense! This ban highlights just how ingrained golf already was in Scottish society. St Andrews Links, established in the early 15th century, is considered the "home of golf" and remains one of the oldest and most revered golf courses in the world. So, when you think of a sport originating in 15th-century Scotland, golf is the clear winner. The other options are much more recent inventions; surfing has ancient Polynesian roots but became popular much later, while Formula 1 and motorbike racing are 20th-century sports.
