Okay, let's delve into the medieval House of Lords. Think of the Middle Ages, roughly from the 11th to the 15th centuries, as a time dominated by land ownership and inherited titles. Power was very concentrated. The House of Lords wasn't an elected body like the House of Commons. Instead, it was made up of those who held their positions by birthright or through appointment due to their status. The nobility, like dukes, earls, and barons, were automatically members. These were the families with titles passed down through generations. Also included were the great landowners â€“ individuals who controlled vast swathes of land and wielded significant economic and social influence. Their land meant power, and that power translated into a seat in the House of Lords. So, the nobility and great landowners held seats because the House of Lords was designed to represent the interests of the most powerful and influential people in the kingdom at that time. While other people may have been wealthy or owned land, it was the scale of land ownership and noble status that granted access to the House of Lords.
