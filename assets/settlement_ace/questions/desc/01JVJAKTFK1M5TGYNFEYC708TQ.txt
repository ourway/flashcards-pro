National Insurance is essentially a system of contributions you make while you're working, which then helps fund various state benefits. Think of it like a collective pot of money that everyone pays into. The biggest things that National Insurance directly supports are the state retirement pension and the National Health Service, or NHS. The state pension provides a regular income for people once they reach retirement age, ensuring they have some financial security. The NHS, of course, provides free healthcare to everyone who needs it. While job allowances and child benefits are important forms of government support, they're actually funded through general taxation â€“ that is, the money the government collects from income tax, VAT, and other sources. So, while the government uses tax revenue for a wide range of things, National Insurance is specifically earmarked for things like pensions and healthcare.
