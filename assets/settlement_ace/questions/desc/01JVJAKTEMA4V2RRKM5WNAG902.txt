The rules of succession to the British throne are pretty straightforward, based on primogeniture, which generally means the eldest child inherits the throne. Think of it like a family tree, with the crown passing down through the generations. Currently, Queen Elizabeth II is the monarch. The next in line is her eldest son, Prince Charles. He's been the Prince of Wales for a very long time, preparing for his eventual role as king. While Prince William is also a prominent member of the Royal Family, and will eventually be king, he comes after his father, Charles, in the line of succession. Prince Harry, being William's younger brother, is further down the line. Prince Philip, the Queen's late husband, was never in line for the throne himself, as he was a consort, not a direct descendant of the royal line. So, because Charles is the Queen's eldest son, he is the heir apparent and next in line to become king.
