Alright, let's talk about the Roman occupation of Britain. The Romans were a major force in Europe, and their influence stretched far and wide. They first invaded Britain in 55 BC under Julius Caesar, but this was more of a reconnaissance mission than a full-scale occupation. The real Roman conquest began in 43 AD under Emperor Claudius. From that point, they established a firm grip on the island, building roads, towns, and forts, and integrating Britain into their empire. Now, here's the key: Roman rule lasted until around 410 AD, when the Roman legions were withdrawn to defend other parts of the empire that were under threat. So, if you do the math, from 43 AD to 410 AD, that's roughly 400 years. While some might think it was a longer or shorter period, 400 years is the generally accepted duration of Roman presence and control in Britain. It's a significant chunk of British history, and their impact is still visible today!
