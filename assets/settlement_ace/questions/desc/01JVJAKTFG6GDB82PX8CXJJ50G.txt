The tradition of eating turkey at Christmas is a relatively recent one, becoming truly popular in Britain during the Victorian era. Before that, wealthier families might have feasted on goose, peacock, or even a boar's head! But as turkey farming became more widespread and affordable, it gradually replaced these other options. The turkey's large size makes it ideal for feeding a large family gathering, and its relatively mild flavour pairs well with a variety of traditional Christmas side dishes. While duck and chicken are certainly eaten in Britain, they're not specifically associated with Christmas dinner in the same way. An ostrich, while a bird, is definitely not a common Christmas meal choice in the UK! So, the turkey has become the quintessential centrepiece of the British Christmas feast due to its size, availability, and relatively recent adoption as the festive bird of choice.
