Okay, so the statement about constituencies with scarce voters being called "Pocket Boroughs" is false. To understand why, let's delve into a bit of British political history. Before reforms in the 19th century, the electoral system was, shall we say, *interesting*. There were these things called "rotten boroughs" and "pocket boroughs," and they weren't quite the same. A "rotten borough" was a constituency that had very few voters, sometimes almost none, often because the population had declined over time, like a deserted town. Now, a "pocket borough" was a constituency controlled by a single person or family, usually a wealthy landowner. They could essentially "nominate" the MP, as the voters were under their influence or control. Think of it as a political playground for the rich. So, while both types of boroughs were problematic due to their lack of genuine representation, the key difference is that "pocket boroughs" were defined by *control*, not just a small number of voters. You might think a small number of voters automatically means it's a pocket borough, but that's not necessarily true; it's the element of control that defines it.
