The idea of Father Christmas arriving at midnight is deeply rooted in Christmas Eve traditions and the anticipation surrounding the holiday. Midnight holds a special significance as it marks the transition from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day, the moment when the celebrations truly begin. Think about it: children are often told to be asleep before midnight so Father Christmas can come and deliver presents. The magic of Christmas is often associated with the quiet, dark hours of the night, adding to the mystique of Father Christmas's arrival. While some might think of him arriving early in the morning, that's usually when children wake up to discover the gifts, not when he's actively delivering them. Noon simply doesn't fit the traditional narrative of a secretive, nighttime visit. The midnight arrival reinforces the idea of a magical, almost clandestine event, fitting perfectly with the folklore surrounding Father Christmas and his Christmas Eve journey.
