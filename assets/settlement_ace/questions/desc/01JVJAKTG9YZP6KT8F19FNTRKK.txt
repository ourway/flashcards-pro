Maiden Castle is one of the largest and most complex Iron Age hillforts in Europe, and it's a truly impressive sight to behold. These hillforts were essentially fortified settlements, and Maiden Castle's origins date back over 6,000 years to the Neolithic period. It really came into its own during the Iron Age, becoming a major tribal centre. Now, to find this historical giant, you need to head to the south of England, specifically to Dorset. Dorset is known for its beautiful coastline, rolling hills, and, of course, Maiden Castle. So, while Wiltshire also boasts its share of ancient sites like Stonehenge, and Cheshire and Lancashire are further north with their own distinct histories, Maiden Castle is firmly rooted in Dorset's landscape. It's a key part of Dorset's rich archaeological heritage, making Dorset the only correct answer.
