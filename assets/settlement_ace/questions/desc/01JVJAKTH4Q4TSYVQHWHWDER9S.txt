Wallace and Gromit are British icons, and their films are a perfect example of stop-motion animation, specifically clay animation, often called "claymation." This technique involves manipulating clay figures frame by frame and photographing each tiny movement. When these photos are played in sequence, it creates the illusion of movement, bringing Wallace, Gromit, and their world to life. Nick Park, the creator, is a master of this art form. While Wallace and Gromit's adventures might contain elements of adventure or even a bit of detective work, the defining characteristic of these films is their visual style and the animation technique used to create them. So, while they might go on adventures, calling them simply "adventure films" misses the core element of *how* they're made. The charm and humor of Wallace and Gromit are intrinsically linked to the painstaking process of animation that makes them so unique and beloved.
