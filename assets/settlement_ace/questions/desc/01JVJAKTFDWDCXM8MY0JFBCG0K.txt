The First World War, a truly devastating conflict, didn't actually begin on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918. That specific time and date marks the *end* of the war, the moment the armistice was signed between the Allies and Germany. Think of it like this: the phrase "the eleventh hour" often means the last possible moment before something happens. In this case, it was the last possible moment before the guns fell silent after four long years of fighting. The war itself started back in 1914, triggered by a complex web of alliances and the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. So, while that November date is hugely significant, it's for the cessation of hostilities, not the commencement. It's a day of remembrance, marking the end of a terrible period in world history, not its beginning.
