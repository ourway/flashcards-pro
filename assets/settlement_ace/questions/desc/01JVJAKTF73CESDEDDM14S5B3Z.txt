The fight for women's suffrage in Britain was a long and arduous one, really gaining momentum in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. While many individuals and groups contributed, the Women's Social and Political Union, or WSPU, played a particularly prominent role. Founded in 1903, the WSPU adopted more direct and militant tactics to campaign for women's right to vote. This included things like demonstrations, civil disobedience, and even acts of vandalism. Emmeline Pankhurst was the driving force behind the WSPU. She believed in "deeds, not words," and her leadership was crucial in shaping the movement's strategy and galvanizing support. While other women were involved, Pankhurst's role as founder and leader makes her the key figure associated with the WSPU's establishment. It's easy to remember her because she was a real firebrand, determined to get women the vote, and the WSPU was her main vehicle for achieving that goal.
