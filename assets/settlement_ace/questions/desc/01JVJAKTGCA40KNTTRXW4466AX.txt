Cloning mammals is a relatively recent scientific achievement, and the UK played a pivotal role. The key thing to remember is Dolly the sheep. In 1996, scientists at the Roslin Institute in Scotland successfully cloned her, making her the first mammal ever to be cloned from an adult somatic cell. This was a huge breakthrough, demonstrating that it was possible to create a genetic copy of an adult animal. The idea that it was a rabbit is incorrect. While rabbits have been involved in cloning research, they weren't the first successful case. Dolly's success was widely publicized and marked a significant moment in scientific history, so remembering her name and species will help you answer this type of question correctly. It's easy to get confused with other animal experiments, but Dolly is the landmark case.
