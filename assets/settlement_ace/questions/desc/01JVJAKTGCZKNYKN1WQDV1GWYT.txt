The National Trust is all about preserving Britain's heritage. Think of it as a guardian of the UK's most treasured places. It was founded way back in 1895 by Octavia Hill, Sir Robert Hunter, and Hardwicke Rawnsley, who were concerned about the impact of industrialisation and urbanisation on the countryside and historic buildings. They wanted to ensure that everyone could access and enjoy these special places for generations to come. So, the National Trust owns and manages a huge portfolio of properties, including historic houses, gardens, coastlines, forests, and nature reserves. They rely on membership fees, donations, and legacies to fund their conservation work. While Shelter focuses on housing and homelessness, Age UK supports older people, and Crisis works to end homelessness, the National Trust is specifically dedicated to protecting physical landmarks and natural beauty spots. That's why it's the charity tasked with maintaining significant constructions, shorelines, and landscapes.
