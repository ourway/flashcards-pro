The Victorian era, spanning from 1837 to 1901, was a time of significant economic and social change in Britain. A key aspect of this period was the move towards free trade. Before this, Britain had many protectionist policies, like tariffs and duties, designed to protect domestic industries. However, these policies were increasingly seen as hindering economic growth and making goods more expensive for consumers. The government, influenced by thinkers like Adam Smith, gradually began to dismantle these barriers. A major step was the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, which had imposed high tariffs on imported grain. By abolishing a number of taxes on imported goods, the government allowed cheaper products to enter the country, fostering competition and stimulating trade. This policy benefited both consumers, who had access to cheaper goods, and industries that relied on imported raw materials. While the Victorians did create large companies, these were not public trading companies. They also didn't import expensive raw materials as a policy. While the abolition of slavery was a significant achievement, it was not directly related to the implementation of free trade policies.
