Local authorities, or councils, are responsible for providing essential services in your area, like schools, social care, waste collection, and road maintenance. To pay for all this, they need a reliable source of income. The two main sources are funding from central government and local taxes. Think of it like this: the central government, which gets its money from national taxes, allocates a portion of that to local councils. This helps ensure that all areas of the UK can provide a basic level of service, regardless of how wealthy they are. Then, local councils also raise money through local taxes, primarily Council Tax, which is paid by residents. This allows them to supplement the central government funding and tailor services to the specific needs of their community. While councils might get some income from other sources, like fees for services or renting out property, these are relatively small compared to the big contributions from central government and local taxes. TV licenses go to the BBC, advertising revenue goes to media companies, and water rates pay for water and sewage services, so none of those directly fund local councils.
