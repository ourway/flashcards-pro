The jury system in the UK is designed to ensure a fair trial, and that fairness hinges on having impartial jurors. Think about it: the legal system needs people who can assess evidence and make decisions without bias. Now, someone with a criminal conviction might have experiences that could influence their judgment, consciously or unconsciously. They might harbor resentment towards the system, or perhaps be more sympathetic to someone accused of a crime. To maintain impartiality, individuals with a criminal record are usually disqualified from jury service. While police officers and judges are also often excluded, this is more due to their professional roles within the legal system, which could also introduce bias. Religious belief has absolutely no bearing on jury service eligibility â€“ the UK is a multi-faith society, and excluding people based on religion would be discriminatory and undermine the principles of justice. So, while police and judges might not be on a jury, a criminal conviction is a direct conflict with the impartiality required.
