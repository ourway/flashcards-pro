Okay, let's talk about buildings from the Middle Ages. When we think of the Middle Ages, which roughly spans from the 5th to the 15th century, we're talking about a period of castles, cathedrals, and significant shifts in power. Edinburgh Castle, perched atop an extinct volcano, has roots stretching way back, but it was during the medieval period that it became a major royal stronghold and a key defensive structure in Scotland. Think of knights and sieges! Similarly, Lincoln Cathedral, with its impressive Gothic architecture, was one of the tallest buildings in the world for over 200 years during the Middle Ages, a testament to the wealth and religious devotion of the time. Now, New St Paul's Cathedral, while magnificent, was actually built much later, in the 17th century, after the Great Fire of London. And the current Houses of Parliament, with its iconic clock tower, was largely constructed in the 19th century. So, while those are important landmarks, they simply don't fit within the timeframe of the Middle Ages.
