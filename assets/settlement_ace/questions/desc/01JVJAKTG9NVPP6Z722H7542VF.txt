Okay, so the UK is made up of four countries, and each one has a special patron saint. Think of it like this: each country has a symbolic protector. England's patron saint is St. George, famous for slaying a dragon â€“ his feast day is celebrated on April 23rd. Scotland has St. Andrew, whose feast day is November 30th; he's represented on the Scottish flag, the Saltire. Wales has St. David, celebrated on March 1st; he was a 6th-century monk who founded many monasteries. Now, Northern Ireland is a little different because it's part of the UK but doesn't have an official patron saint in the same way. However, St. Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland, is widely associated with Northern Ireland, and St. Patrick's Day on March 17th is a public holiday there. So, while the connection is slightly different for Northern Ireland, the statement that each of the four countries has a patron saint is generally considered true due to the strong association of St. Patrick.
