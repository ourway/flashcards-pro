The story of Boudicca is one of fierce resistance against Roman rule in Britain. In AD 60 or 61, while her husband Prasutagus ruled the Iceni tribe in what is now Norfolk, he died. The Romans, disregarding his will, annexed his kingdom and treated Boudicca and her daughters brutally. This sparked a major uprising. Boudicca led the Iceni and other tribes in a revolt, successfully destroying Colchester (then Camulodunum), London (Londinium), and Verulamium (modern-day St Albans). Although the rebellion was eventually crushed by the Roman army, Boudicca became a symbol of British resistance and courage. Her name, meaning "victory," reflects her spirit. The statue on Westminster Bridge, near the Houses of Parliament, commemorates her as a powerful and iconic figure in British history. It's a reminder of the early struggles for freedom and independence on the island. While other historical figures like Ethelfleda were important rulers, Boudicca's rebellion against the Roman Empire is what makes her the most famously remembered queen with a statue in such a prominent location.
