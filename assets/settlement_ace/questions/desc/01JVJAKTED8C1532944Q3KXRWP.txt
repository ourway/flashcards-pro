St. Patrick is widely recognised as the patron saint of Ireland, including Northern Ireland, even though he wasn't actually Irish! He was likely born in Roman Britain in the late 4th century and was kidnapped and brought to Ireland as a slave. After escaping and becoming a priest, he returned to Ireland as a missionary. He's credited with bringing Christianity to Ireland, and legends abound about his life, including the famous story of him driving all the snakes out of Ireland â€“ though, geologically speaking, Ireland never had snakes! St. Patrick's Day, celebrated on March 17th, is a huge cultural event, not just in Ireland and Northern Ireland, but around the world, with parades and festivities. While St. George is the patron saint of England, St. Andrew of Scotland, and St. David of Wales, it's St. Patrick who holds this special place in the hearts of many in Northern Ireland, connecting them to a shared Irish heritage.
