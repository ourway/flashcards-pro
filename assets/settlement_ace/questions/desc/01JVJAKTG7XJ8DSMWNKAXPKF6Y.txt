Prime Minister's Questions, often called PMQs, is a key feature of the British political system, designed to hold the Prime Minister accountable. It's a weekly session where Members of Parliament, or MPs, get to directly question the Prime Minister on any topic they choose. This tradition developed over time, evolving from earlier forms of parliamentary questioning. The goal is to ensure transparency and allow for scrutiny of the government's policies and actions. Holding it more frequently, like every day or twice a week, would be impractical and take up too much parliamentary time. A monthly session wouldn't provide enough opportunity for timely accountability. So, the weekly format strikes a balance, providing regular opportunities for MPs to challenge the Prime Minister and for the public to stay informed about important issues. It's a lively and often combative exchange, considered a cornerstone of British democracy.
