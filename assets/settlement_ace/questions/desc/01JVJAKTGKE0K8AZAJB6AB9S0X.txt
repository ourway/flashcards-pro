England winning the World Cup in 1966 is a massive moment in the nation's sporting history, and it's something you'll definitely want to remember for the Life in the UK test. The final was played at Wembley Stadium, and England beat West Germany 4-2 after extra time. The captain of that winning team was Bobby Moore. He was a legendary defender, known for his skill, leadership, and sportsmanship. It was Moore who lifted the Jules Rimet trophy, the original World Cup trophy, making him an iconic figure in English football. While Andy Murray is a famous tennis player, Jackie Stewart a Formula One legend, and Sir Chris Hoy a champion cyclist, they're all associated with different sports and came to prominence much later than 1966. So, when you think of the 1966 World Cup victory, remember Bobby Moore as the captain who led England to glory.
