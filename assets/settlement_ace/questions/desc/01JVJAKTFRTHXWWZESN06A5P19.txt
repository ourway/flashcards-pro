Okay, so the reason why it's true that dogs in public places must wear a collar displaying the owner's name and address comes down to responsible pet ownership and public safety. Think about it: if a dog gets lost or wanders off, that collar is the quickest way to reunite them with their owner. This requirement isn't just some arbitrary rule; it's actually enshrined in law, specifically the Control of Dogs Order 1992. This legislation aims to ensure that lost or stray dogs can be easily identified and returned home, preventing them from becoming a nuisance or, worse, a danger to themselves or others. While microchipping is also a common practice and legally required, a collar provides immediate, visible information. It's much faster to read a tag than to have a dog scanned for a microchip. So, while you might think it's enough to just have your dog microchipped, the law requires that visible identification on a collar as well.
