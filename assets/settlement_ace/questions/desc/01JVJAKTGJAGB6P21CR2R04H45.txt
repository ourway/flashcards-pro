The period of the English Civil War in the mid-17th century was a tumultuous time in British history, marked by conflict between the monarchy and Parliament. Charles I, not Charles II, was the monarch who clashed with Parliament, leading to his execution in 1649. Following Charles I's execution, England became a republic under Oliver Cromwell. However, after Cromwell's death, the monarchy was restored. It was Charles II, the son of the executed Charles I, who then became king. After his father's execution, Charles II attempted to regain the throne but was defeated. Famously, he hid in an oak tree – the Royal Oak – to evade capture by Parliamentary forces after the Battle of Worcester in 1651. He eventually fled to Europe and lived in exile until the monarchy was restored in 1660, and he was invited back to become king. Therefore, while his father was overthrown, it was Charles II who experienced the daring escape and exile.
