Ramadan is a really important month in the Islamic calendar, a time of fasting, prayer, and reflection for Muslims worldwide. Think of it as a spiritual reset. At the end of Ramadan, there's a huge celebration to mark the end of the fasting period. This celebration is called Eid al-Fitr. The key to remembering this is the word "Fitr" itself, which can be associated with the idea of "breaking the fast" or "after." So, Eid al-Fitr is literally the festival that comes *after* the fasting of Ramadan. Eid ul Adha, on the other hand, is a different festival that commemorates Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son and is celebrated later in the year. Vaisakhi is a Sikh festival celebrating the founding of the Khalsa, and Hannukah is a Jewish festival of lights. So, while all are important religious festivals, only Eid al-Fitr directly marks the end of Ramadan.
