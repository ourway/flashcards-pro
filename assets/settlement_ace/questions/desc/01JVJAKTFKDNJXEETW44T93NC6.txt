Okay, so when it comes to who gets to vote in UK general elections, it's all about citizenship and residency. The right to vote in these national elections is generally reserved for British citizens, along with qualifying Commonwealth citizens and citizens of the Republic of Ireland who are resident in the UK. This stems from the fundamental principle that electing a country's parliament is a core right tied to national identity and allegiance. While EU citizens living in the UK can participate in local elections, and were able to vote in EU elections when the UK was a member, national parliamentary elections are different. Think of it like this: electing Members of Parliament is about deciding who governs the UK, and that's a decision reserved for those who hold UK citizenship (or have very specific historical ties, like some Commonwealth citizens). It might be tempting to think that long-term residents should be able to vote, but the law specifically restricts this to maintain the link between citizenship and national governance.
