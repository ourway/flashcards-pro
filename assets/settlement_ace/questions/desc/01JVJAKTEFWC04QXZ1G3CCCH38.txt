Anne of Cleves wasn't a Spanish princess; she actually came from the Duchy of Cleves, which is part of modern-day Germany. Henry VIII's marital history is quite notorious, and Anne of Cleves was his fourth wife. The marriage was a political alliance, intended to strengthen England's position against potential Catholic enemies like France and Spain. Henry was initially impressed by a portrait of Anne, but upon meeting her in person, he was reportedly very disappointed. The marriage was quickly annulled after only six months. While Henry did marry Spanish royalty – Catherine of Aragon was his first wife and a Spanish princess – Anne of Cleves was definitely not. So, if you thought she was Spanish, you might be confusing her with Catherine of Aragon or perhaps just associating all European royalty together, but Cleves is the key to remembering her origin.
