The Gunpowder Plot is a significant event in British history, rooted in religious tensions of the early 17th century. At the time, England was ruled by King James I, a Protestant monarch. A group of Catholics, feeling persecuted and marginalized, conspired to assassinate the King and blow up the Houses of Parliament during the State Opening. Their plan was to replace him with a Catholic monarch. Guy Fawkes was the individual tasked with guarding the explosives. However, the plot was discovered thanks to an anonymous letter, and on the night of November 4th, 1605, Fawkes was found in the cellars beneath Parliament with the gunpowder. He was arrested, and the plot was foiled. The date of this discovery, and therefore the failure of the Gunpowder Plot, was November 5th, 1605. This is why, every year on November 5th, bonfires are lit, and fireworks are set off to celebrate the foiling of the plot and the safety of the King and Parliament. The other dates are incorrect because the Gunpowder Plot is a specific historical event that happened in 1605.
