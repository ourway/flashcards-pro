The Troubles in Northern Ireland were a complex period of ethno-nationalist conflict that really took hold in 1969. To understand why, think about the historical context. For decades, tensions had been simmering between the largely Protestant unionist community, who wanted Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and the largely Catholic nationalist community, who desired a united Ireland. By the late 1960s, these tensions erupted into widespread civil unrest, fueled by issues of discrimination in housing, employment, and policing. The year 1969 saw a significant escalation of violence, including the Battle of the Bogside in Derry/Londonderry, which is widely considered the start of the Troubles. While earlier events certainly contributed to the conflict, 1969 marks the point when it became a sustained and widespread period of violence. The other dates are significant in Irish history – 1921 and 1922 relate to the partition of Ireland – but they don't pinpoint the start of the Troubles themselves.
