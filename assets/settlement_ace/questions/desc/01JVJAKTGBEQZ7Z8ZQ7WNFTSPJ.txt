Okay, let's explore the story behind mapping Australia's coastline. While figures like Admiral Nelson and Sir Francis Drake are renowned British naval heroes, their fame rests on victories in European waters and battles against the Spanish Armada. They weren't involved in exploring the Pacific. Now, James Cook, a captain in the Royal Navy, is famous for his three voyages to the Pacific Ocean. During these voyages, particularly his first, which began in 1768, he meticulously charted the coast of New Zealand and, crucially, the eastern coastline of Australia in 1770. He claimed this land for Britain, naming it New South Wales. Although other explorers had sighted Australia before, Cook's detailed mapping was the first comprehensive survey, opening the way for British settlement. So, while others sailed the seas, it was James Cook who created the detailed maps of Australia's coast that we still rely on today.
