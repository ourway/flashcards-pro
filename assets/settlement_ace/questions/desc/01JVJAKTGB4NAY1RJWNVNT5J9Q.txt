Okay, here's an explanation about the British constitution:

The UK's system of government is unique because it doesn't rely on a single, codified document like the US Constitution. Instead, it operates on an *unwritten* constitution. This means the rules and principles that govern the UK are drawn from various sources. These sources include Acts of Parliament, like the Human Rights Act, common law established through court rulings over centuries, and conventions, which are long-established traditions and practices. Think of it as a living, breathing set of guidelines that has evolved over time. For example, the idea that the Prime Minister must be a member of the House of Commons is a convention, not something written down in a single document. While certain documents like Magna Carta (1215) are hugely important, they are just *parts* of the overall constitutional framework. So, because there's no single, written constitution, the answer is no. Other countries often have a specific document that lays out the fundamental laws, but the UK's approach is much more flexible and based on historical precedent.
