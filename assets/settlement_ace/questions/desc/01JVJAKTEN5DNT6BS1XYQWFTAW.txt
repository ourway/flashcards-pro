The Book of Common Prayer is a cornerstone of the Church of England, and its creation is closely tied to the English Reformation. Think back to the 16th century when religious changes were sweeping the country. Henry VIII had broken with the Roman Catholic Church, but it was during his son Edward VI's reign that the English Reformation really took hold. Edward, a devout Protestant, wanted to standardise church services and make them accessible to everyone in English, not Latin. So, he commissioned the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, to create a prayer book in English. This became the Book of Common Prayer, first published in 1549. It outlined the order of services and prayers to be used in all Church of England churches. While Henry VIII initiated the break from Rome, he didn't commission this specific book. Queen Mary, a Catholic, actually tried to suppress the Book of Common Prayer. So, Edward VI is the correct answer because he actively championed and commanded its writing to further the Protestant Reformation in England.
