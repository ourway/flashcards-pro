The British police force operates on the fundamental principle of universal protection. Think of it like this: the police aren't just there for some people, they're there for everyone within the UK's borders. This stems from the core idea of the rule of law, a cornerstone of British society, which dictates that everyone is equal under the law and entitled to its protection. This includes not only British citizens, but also residents, visitors, and even those who might be in the country illegally. The police's duty is to maintain order, prevent crime, and protect all individuals from harm, regardless of their nationality, background, or where they live. Focusing solely on British citizens would create a two-tiered system of justice, undermining the very principles the police force is meant to uphold. So, while it might seem intuitive to think of the police protecting citizens first, their mandate is much broader, encompassing everyone within the UK.
