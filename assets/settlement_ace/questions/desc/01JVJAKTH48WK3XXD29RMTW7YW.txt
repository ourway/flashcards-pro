Isaac Newton, a towering figure in scientific history, conducted groundbreaking experiments with light in the late 17th century. Before Newton, the prevailing belief was that prisms somehow *created* colors when light passed through them. Newton challenged this idea. In a darkened room, he passed a beam of sunlight through a prism and observed the familiar spectrum of colors – red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet – projected onto a wall. Crucially, he then passed a single color from that spectrum through another prism and found it couldn't be further divided. This led him to conclude that white light isn't colorless but is actually composed of all the colors of the rainbow, which the prism separates. It's a fundamental discovery about the nature of light and color, and it's why the statement is true. While it might seem counterintuitive that white light contains all colors, Newton's experiments definitively proved it.
