The role of a mayor in the UK has deep historical roots, evolving from medieval times when mayors were originally appointed by the Crown to oversee local affairs and represent royal interests. Over centuries, their role shifted to become more representative of the local population, often elected from among the local councillors. While a mayor doesn't typically wield significant executive power like a prime minister, they are the figurehead of the local council. Their duties are largely ceremonial, involving chairing council meetings, representing the council at civic events, and acting as a point of contact between the council and the community. They embody the council's identity and provide a sense of continuity and tradition. While a local business leader or celebrity might be well-known in the area, they don't hold any formal position within the local government structure. A member of the Royal Family might visit, but they wouldn't be involved in the day-to-day running or ceremonial leadership of a local council.
