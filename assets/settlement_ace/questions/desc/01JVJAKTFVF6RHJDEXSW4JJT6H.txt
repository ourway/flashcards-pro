During the Anglo-Saxon period, which spanned roughly from the 5th to the 11th centuries, Britain was undergoing significant religious and cultural shifts. Initially, the Anglo-Saxons followed pagan beliefs brought over from continental Europe. However, Christianity gradually spread, largely due to the efforts of missionaries. St. Augustine, sent by Pope Gregory the Great in 597 AD, is particularly important. He established a base in Canterbury and began converting King Ethelbert of Kent, a pivotal moment in the Christianization of England. Simultaneously, but independently, St. Columba and his followers, originating from Ireland, were spreading Christianity in the north, particularly in Scotland and Northumbria. So, while farming techniques are important, and there were certainly uprisings and warriors during this time, the defining role of both Augustine and Columba was to introduce and establish Christianity, making them early Christian missionaries.
