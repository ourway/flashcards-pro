Okay, let's break down why the Reformation is the right answer here. Back in the 16th century, King Henry VIII wanted to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, but the Pope wouldn't allow it. This was a big deal because Henry wanted a male heir to secure the Tudor dynasty. So, in a nutshell, Henry decided to take matters into his own hands. He initiated a series of actions that led to the separation of the Church of England from the authority of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. This wasn't just about a divorce; it was about power, wealth, and control. He declared himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England in 1534 through the Act of Supremacy. This whole process of reforming the church, challenging its doctrines, and establishing a new religious order is known as the Reformation. The other options are incorrect because the Holy Wars refer to the Crusades, which happened much earlier. The Glorious Revolution was a later event focused on political power, and the Rebellion of the Clans refers to Scottish history.
