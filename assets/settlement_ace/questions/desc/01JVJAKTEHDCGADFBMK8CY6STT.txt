Cardiff became the capital of Wales in 1955, although it had already grown into a significant port city during the Industrial Revolution. Its growth was fueled by the booming coal industry in South Wales, making it a vital hub for exporting coal across the world. Before being officially named the capital, there was actually quite a bit of debate about which city should hold the title! While Swansea is a larger city and has a longer history, Cardiff was chosen because of its economic importance and its role as a center for Welsh administration. Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland, and Belfast is the capital of Northern Ireland, so they're both definitely in the wrong country. So, Cardiff is the correct answer because it's the city officially recognized as the capital of Wales.
