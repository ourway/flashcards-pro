Okay, let's break down the emergence of Protestantism. To understand it, we need to go back to the 16th century and the Reformation. Before this time, the dominant Christian church in Western Europe was the Roman Catholic Church. However, there was growing dissatisfaction with some of its practices, like the sale of indulgences (essentially, pardons for sins). Key figures like Martin Luther in Germany and John Calvin in Switzerland began to challenge these practices and doctrines.

Luther famously posted his "Ninety-Five Theses" in 1517, which sparked widespread debate. These reformers believed that the Bible should be the ultimate authority, not the Pope, and that salvation was achieved through faith alone, not through good works or sacraments. Because they were "protesting" against the Catholic Church, their movement became known as Protestantism. Different Protestant denominations emerged, such as Lutherans, Calvinists, and Anglicans. So, Protestantism is the correct answer because it directly resulted from the Reformation's challenge to the established Catholic Church. While Catholicism predates the Reformation, and Methodism is a later Protestant denomination, only Protestantism emerged directly from the Reformation itself. Hinduism, of course, is a completely separate religion originating in India.
