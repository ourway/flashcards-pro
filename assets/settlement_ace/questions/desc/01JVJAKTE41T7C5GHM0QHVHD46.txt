The Youth Court is where cases involving young people aged 10 to 17 are usually heard in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. This court is designed to be less formal than adult courts, recognizing that young people may not fully understand the legal system. The focus is often on rehabilitation and preventing re-offending, rather than simply punishment. Interestingly, Scotland has a different system; cases there are usually heard by the Children's Hearing system, which takes a welfare-based approach. You might have been tempted by "Children's Court" or "Child Court," but these aren't actually used in the UK legal system. The term "youth" specifically denotes this age group in legal contexts, hence the Youth Court. Remember, the age of criminal responsibility in the UK is 10, which is relatively low compared to some other countries, making the Youth Court a crucial part of the justice system.
