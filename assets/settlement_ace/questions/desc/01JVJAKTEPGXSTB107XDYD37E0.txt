Civil law is all about resolving disputes between individuals or organizations. Think of it as the legal framework that governs our everyday interactions. It covers a wide range of issues, from contracts and property to family matters and personal injury. The key thing to remember is that civil law cases are usually brought by one individual or organization against another, seeking compensation or some other form of remedy. So, when we talk about disputes between landlords and tenants, or discrimination in the workplace, these are classic examples of civil law in action. A tenant might sue a landlord for failing to maintain the property, or an employee might sue an employer for discrimination. These are private disputes that fall under the umbrella of civil law. On the other hand, carrying a weapon or selling tobacco illegally are criminal offences. These are actions against the state, and the state prosecutes them. The aim here is to punish the offender and deter others from committing similar crimes, which is a key difference from civil law's focus on resolving private disputes.
