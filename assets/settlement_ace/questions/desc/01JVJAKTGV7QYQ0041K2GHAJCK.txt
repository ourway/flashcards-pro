Alright, so the period we're talking about, stretching from the Norman Conquest in 1066 to around 1485, is known as the Middle Ages, or the Medieval period. The Norman Conquest, when William the Conqueror invaded England, is a really clear starting point because it brought huge changes in language, law, and culture. Think about the impact of French on the English language, for example! Now, why does it end around 1485? Well, that's roughly when the Wars of the Roses ended and the Tudor dynasty began with Henry VII. This marked a real shift away from the feudal system and towards a more modern state. The Middle Ages is often associated with knights, castles, and the feudal system. The Age of Discovery came later, the Renaissance was happening in Europe but its full impact on Britain was later, and Late Antiquity is even earlier, referring to the decline of the Roman Empire. So, the Middle Ages perfectly captures that era of castles, knights, and significant societal change in Britain.
