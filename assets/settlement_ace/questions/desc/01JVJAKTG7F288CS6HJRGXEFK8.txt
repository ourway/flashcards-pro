The English Civil War in 1642 was a pivotal moment in British history, a clash between those who believed in the absolute power of the monarchy and those who sought greater parliamentary control. This conflict wasn't just a political squabble; it was a battle over the very nature of governance. On one side were the Cavaliers, also known as Royalists, who supported King Charles I. They were often wealthy landowners and members of the aristocracy, known for their flamboyant style and loyalty to the crown. On the other side were the Roundheads, supporters of Parliament. The name "Roundheads" came from their typically short haircuts, a stark contrast to the long, flowing locks of the Cavaliers. This group included many merchants, members of the middle class, and those who favoured a more Puritan lifestyle. So, the correct answer is the Roundheads and the Cavaliers because these were the two main factions that emerged and fought against each other during the English Civil War. The other options refer to different historical periods or aspects of British society that weren't directly involved in this specific conflict.
