The UK Parliament is made up of two houses: the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The House of Commons is where elected Members of Parliament (MPs) represent their constituencies, making it the primary chamber for democratic decision-making. The House of Lords, on the other hand, is largely appointed and serves as a revising chamber. Historically, the House of Lords held more power, but reforms, particularly the Parliament Act of 1911 and later acts, significantly reduced its authority. These acts were pivotal in establishing the primacy of the House of Commons. While the Lords can debate, suggest amendments, and delay legislation, they cannot ultimately block bills passed by the Commons. This ensures that the will of the elected representatives, and therefore the people, prevails. The hint is a good way to remember it - the 'Commons' representing the 'common people's choice' takes precedence.
