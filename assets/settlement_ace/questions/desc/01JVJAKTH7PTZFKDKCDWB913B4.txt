The suffragettes were a pivotal force in British history, emerging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries during a time when women were largely excluded from political life. The right to vote, known as suffrage, was almost exclusively reserved for men. Frustration with the slow progress of peaceful campaigns led to the formation of more militant groups, most notably the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) led by Emmeline Pankhurst. The suffragettes, members of the WSPU, adopted tactics like protests, civil disobedience, and even acts of vandalism to draw attention to their cause. Their actions, though controversial, kept the issue of women's suffrage in the public eye and ultimately contributed to the Representation of the People Act in 1918, which granted some women the right to vote. It's important to remember that while some women did choose to live abroad, stay single, or raise families, these choices weren't specifically linked to the suffragette movement, which was solely focused on achieving voting rights for women.
