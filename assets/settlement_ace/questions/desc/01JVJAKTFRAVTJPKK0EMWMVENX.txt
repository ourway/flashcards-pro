The Victorian era, spanning from 1837 to 1901 during Queen Victoria's reign, was indeed a period of immense expansion for the British Empire. Think of it as Britain's global footprint getting significantly larger. India became a crown jewel, directly ruled by the British after the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857, transforming the existing East India Company's control into formal colonial administration. Australia, initially a penal colony, saw massive growth due to gold rushes and agricultural opportunities, solidifying British dominance. In Africa, the "Scramble for Africa" saw Britain acquire vast territories, including parts of South Africa, Egypt, and Nigeria, driven by economic interests and strategic positioning. While the Empire had existed before Victoria, her reign marked a peak in its power and geographical reach, making it accurate to say it expanded to include all of India, Australia, and significant portions of Africa during this time. It's easy to underestimate the scale, but visualizing a map of the world with British territories highlighted during this era really brings home the extent of their influence.
