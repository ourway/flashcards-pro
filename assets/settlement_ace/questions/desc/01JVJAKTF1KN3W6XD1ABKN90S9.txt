The Huguenots were French Protestants who faced severe persecution in France, particularly during the 17th and 18th centuries. The Edict of Nantes in 1598 had granted them some religious freedom, but this was revoked in 1685 by Louis XIV with the Edict of Fontainebleau. This revocation led to a mass exodus of Huguenots from France. Fearing for their lives and religious freedom, they sought refuge in various countries, including England, where they were welcomed for their skills and industry. Many were skilled artisans, weavers, and merchants, and their arrival significantly boosted the English economy. So, while Germany, Pakistan and India all have their own histories of migration and refugees, the Huguenots specifically originated from France due to religious persecution. The period between 1680 and 1720 saw the largest wave of Huguenot refugees arriving in Britain, making France the correct answer.
