The Proms, short for Promenade Concerts, are a classical music festival held every summer in London. Their history is deeply intertwined with the BBC. Back in 1927, the BBC took over the sponsorship and organisation of the Proms, ensuring their survival and accessibility to a wider audience. This was a significant move, as it cemented the BBC's role in promoting culture and the arts within the UK. The Proms are famous for their informal atmosphere, where audience members can stand or "promenade" in the arena, making classical music more approachable. While the Aldeburgh Festival focuses on classical music too, and Glastonbury is a massive contemporary music festival, neither has the long-standing BBC connection that defines the Proms. The Eisteddfod is a celebration of Welsh culture, primarily through music and poetry, but it's not organised or sponsored by the BBC. So, when you think of the BBC and classical music concerts, the Proms are the perfect match.
