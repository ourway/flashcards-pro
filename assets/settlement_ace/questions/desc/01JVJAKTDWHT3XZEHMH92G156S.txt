The idea of the 'Divine Right of Kings' was a big deal in British history, particularly during the reigns of monarchs like James I and Charles I in the 17th century. It essentially meant that a monarch's authority to rule came directly from God, not from the people or any earthly power. Think of it as a direct appointment from above! This belief gave kings immense power because challenging them was seen as challenging God himself. This concept was used to justify absolute monarchy, where the king had supreme authority without needing the consent of Parliament or anyone else. The idea that the king was appointed by God is the core of this concept. Other options, like the English king ruling France, relate to different historical claims and conflicts, such as the Hundred Years' War, but have nothing to do with the fundamental justification of a monarch's power based on divine authority.
