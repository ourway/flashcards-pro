Okay, let's break down why the statement about the 1921 treaty and Irish independence is true. For centuries, Ireland was under British rule, and there was a long struggle for independence. This struggle really intensified in the early 20th century. The key event here is the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. This treaty was signed between representatives of the British government and Irish leaders. What it did was establish the Irish Free State, which comprised the southern part of Ireland. Now, it's important to note that this wasn't *complete* independence in the way we might think of it today. The Irish Free State was initially a dominion within the British Empire, meaning it still had some ties to the British Crown. However, it was a massive step forward. It granted Ireland self-governance and the ability to create its own laws and institutions. So, while the road to full independence continued, the 1921 treaty was a pivotal moment, effectively granting independence to the southern part of Ireland, making the statement accurate. It's a cornerstone of Irish history and a crucial point to remember.
