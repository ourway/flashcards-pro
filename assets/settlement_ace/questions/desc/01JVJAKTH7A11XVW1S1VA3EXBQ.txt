The Union Flag, often called the Union Jack, is a powerful symbol of the United Kingdom, and its design is a fascinating piece of history. It's not just a random pattern; it's actually a combination of three different national flags. First, there's the red cross of St. George, the patron saint of England. Then, there's the white diagonal cross of St. Andrew, who is the patron saint of Scotland. Finally, there's the red diagonal cross of St. Patrick, representing Northern Ireland. It's important to note that Wales isn't directly represented in the Union Flag because when the first version was created in 1606, Wales was already part of the Kingdom of England. So, when you look at the Union Flag, you're seeing these three crosses blended together, representing the union of these nations under one crown. That's why it contains three crosses.
