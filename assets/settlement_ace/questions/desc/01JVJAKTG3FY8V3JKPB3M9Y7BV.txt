When someone owes you money and refuses to pay, the legal system provides a way to reclaim it. Different courts handle different types of cases. The County Court is the primary court in England and Wales for dealing with civil disputes, including debt recovery. Think of it as the go-to place for resolving financial disagreements between individuals or businesses. It handles a wide range of claims, from small debts to more substantial amounts. The other courts have very different roles: Youth Courts deal with young offenders, Coroner's Courts investigate deaths, and Magistrates' Courts handle criminal cases and some civil matters, but not general debt recovery. So, if you're trying to get back money owed to you, the County Court is the correct avenue to pursue.
