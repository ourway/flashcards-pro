Criminal laws are those designed to protect society as a whole by prohibiting certain actions and setting out punishments for those who break these rules. Think of them as the bedrock of a safe and orderly society. They cover actions that directly harm individuals or disrupt the peace. Murder, of course, is the ultimate violation, taking a human life. Racial crimes, motivated by prejudice, target individuals based on their identity and undermine community cohesion. Theft deprives people of their property, while assault involves physical harm or the threat of it. Carrying weapons or drugs illegally poses a risk to public safety and often fuels other criminal activities. These are all clear-cut examples of actions that the state deems unacceptable and punishable under criminal law. The other options, like disputes between landlords and tenants or faulty consumer goods, fall under civil law, where individuals seek redress for wrongs done to them personally. Similarly, unfair dismissal or workplace discrimination are generally addressed through employment tribunals and are not typically considered criminal matters.
