The Northern Ireland Assembly, established as part of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, is a key institution in Northern Ireland's devolved government. Its primary role is to legislate on a range of issues, from health and education to the environment and social services, impacting the daily lives of people in Northern Ireland. The Assembly is designed to represent the diverse communities within Northern Ireland, and to ensure broad participation in the political process. To achieve this representation, the Assembly has 90 members, known as Members of the Legislative Assembly, or MLAs. The number was initially 108, with each of the 18 parliamentary constituencies electing 6 members. However, this was reduced to 90 in 2017, with each constituency electing 5 members. So, while 12 and 60 are numbers associated with other political bodies in the UK, and 108 was the original number of members, the current total number of members in the Northern Ireland Assembly is 90.
