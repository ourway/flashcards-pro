The British police force operates on a foundation of public trust and legitimacy. To maintain this trust, officers must be held to the highest standards of conduct. Think about it: how can someone enforce the law if they themselves are breaking it? The entire system of justice relies on the integrity of those who uphold it. While political neutrality is important for maintaining impartiality in policing, and rudeness or abuse are obviously unacceptable behaviors, the *essential* requirement boils down to obeying the law. It's the bedrock principle. Using private information for personal gain is also illegal and unethical, but the core function of a police officer hinges on their own adherence to the legal framework they are sworn to uphold. Without that, the entire system crumbles. It's a bit like a doctor following medical ethics or a teacher following educational standards. The profession demands it.
