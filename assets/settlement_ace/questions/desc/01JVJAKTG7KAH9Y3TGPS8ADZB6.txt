Before 1918, women couldn't vote in the UK at all. The Representation of the People Act in 1918 granted some women the right to vote, but with restrictions. Only women over the age of 30 who met certain property qualifications could participate. This was a huge step, but it still left many women disenfranchised. The age disparity was based on the idea that younger women were less experienced and perhaps more easily influenced. However, this created a significant inequality. It wasn't until the Equal Franchise Act of 1928 that women finally achieved equal voting rights with men. This act lowered the voting age for women to 21, the same age as men. So, 1928 is significant because it marks the year when women finally had the same voting rights as men in the UK, a crucial milestone in the fight for gender equality. It's easy to get confused with the 1918 act, but remember 1928 is when full equality was achieved.
