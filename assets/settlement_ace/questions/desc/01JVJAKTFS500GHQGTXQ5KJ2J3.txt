Okay, let's talk about royal residences and political power in the UK. The UK has a fascinating system where the monarch, currently King Charles III, and the Prime Minister have distinct roles and separate official residences. Buckingham Palace in London has served as the official London residence and administrative headquarters of the monarch since Queen Victoria's reign in 1837. It's where you'll find the Changing of the Guard ceremony and where many state events are held. 10 Downing Street, on the other hand, is the official residence and workplace of the British Prime Minister. It's been the Prime Minister's official home since 1735. So, while both buildings are incredibly important and located in London, they represent different arms of the British government. It's easy to get them mixed up because they are both iconic buildings, but remembering that the monarch lives and works at Buckingham Palace, and the Prime Minister lives and works at 10 Downing Street, will help you keep them straight.
