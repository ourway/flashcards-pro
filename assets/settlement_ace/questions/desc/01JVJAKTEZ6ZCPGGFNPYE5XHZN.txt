In the UK, the law protects the right of individuals to choose their partners freely. Arranged marriages, which are different from forced marriages, are perfectly acceptable as long as both individuals genuinely consent to the union. The key distinction lies in the element of choice. In an arranged marriage, families may play a significant role in introducing potential partners, but the final decision rests entirely with the individuals involved. Forced marriage, on the other hand, is illegal and a serious crime in the UK, as it involves coercion, threats, or any form of pressure that prevents someone from freely consenting to marry. The UK government actively works to prevent forced marriages and provides support to victims. So, while some might mistakenly believe that any form of arranged marriage is unacceptable due to cultural differences, it's crucial to remember that consent is paramount under UK law, making arranged marriages, with full consent, perfectly legal and acceptable.
