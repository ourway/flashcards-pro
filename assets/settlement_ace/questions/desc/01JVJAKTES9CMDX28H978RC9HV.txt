The Union Flag, often called the Union Jack, is a combination of three crosses representing different patron saints of the United Kingdom. The flag incorporates the St. George's Cross, a red cross on a white background, which represents England. Then there's the St. Andrew's Cross, a white diagonal cross on a blue background, symbolizing Scotland. Finally, the St. Patrick's Cross, a red diagonal cross on a white background, represents Northern Ireland. Now, here's the key: Wales isn't represented in the Union Flag. This is because when the first version of the Union Flag was created in 1606, Wales was already united with England. St. David is the patron saint of Wales, but his cross isn't included. So, while it might seem like all the countries of the UK are represented through their patron saints, that's not quite the case. It's a common misconception, but remembering that Wales was already part of England when the flag was designed helps clarify why the Welsh dragon isn't flying on the Union Jack.
