Okay, let's talk about the Scottish Parliament. For centuries, Scotland had its own parliament, but it was dissolved in 1707 when the Acts of Union created the United Kingdom. For nearly 300 years, Scotland was governed directly by the UK Parliament in London. However, the desire for greater Scottish control over Scottish affairs never really went away. Throughout the 20th century, there were various attempts to establish some form of Scottish assembly. Finally, in 1997, a referendum was held in Scotland, and the Scottish people voted overwhelmingly in favour of creating a new Scottish Parliament with devolved powers. So, after all that history and campaigning, the new Scottish Parliament was officially established in 1999, marking a significant moment in Scottish and British history, giving Scotland more autonomy over areas like education, health, and some aspects of law. The other dates are incorrect because they don't align with this timeline of devolution in Scotland.
