Bronze is a really important alloy in human history, marking a significant technological leap forward. The Bronze Age, which gets its name from this metal, started around 4,000 years ago. Before bronze, people primarily used stone tools, hence the Stone Age. But stone tools are, well, stone! They're brittle and not as effective for many tasks. Bronze, made by combining copper and tin, is much stronger and more durable. This allowed for better tools, weapons, and even art. The discovery of bronze smelting and casting revolutionized societies, leading to advancements in agriculture, warfare, and trade. While humans were developing and using tools long before that, the ability to create bronze specifically emerged around 2000 BC, or 4,000 years ago from our current time. So, while humans have been around for much longer, the Bronze Age and the creation of bronze itself is a relatively more recent development in the grand scheme of things.
