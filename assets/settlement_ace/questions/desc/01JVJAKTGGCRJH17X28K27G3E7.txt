April Fool's Day, celebrated on the 1st of April, is a tradition with origins that are a bit murky, but it's been observed in Britain for centuries. One theory links it to the shift from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century. Some people were slow to adopt the new calendar, and those who still celebrated the New Year at the end of March were mocked as "April fools." Over time, this evolved into a day of lighthearted pranks and hoaxes. The key thing to remember for the test is that the tradition dictates a specific time limit for these pranks. The custom in the UK is that April Fool's jokes are only played until midday. After noon, the joke's on the prankster! If you try to play a prank in the afternoon, you're considered the fool. This half-day limit is a long-standing part of the tradition, distinguishing it from other prank-filled days. So, while the temptation to prank all day might be strong, sticking to the morning is the British way.
