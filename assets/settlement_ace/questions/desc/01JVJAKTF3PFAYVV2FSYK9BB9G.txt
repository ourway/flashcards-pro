The Butler Act, officially the Education Act of 1944, was a landmark piece of legislation in British history, fundamentally reshaping the education system after the Second World War. Before the Act, access to secondary education was often determined by a child's ability to pay, creating significant inequalities. The Act aimed to address this by establishing a tripartite system of grammar, technical, and secondary modern schools, all offering free secondary education to all children, regardless of their background. This was a huge step towards a more meritocratic society, providing opportunities for social mobility. While primary education was already largely free before 1944, and university education remained fee-based, the Butler Act's focus was specifically on making secondary education accessible to everyone. It's interesting to note that the Act also introduced the concept of the 11-plus exam, used to allocate students to different types of secondary schools, a system that has since been largely phased out but remains a significant part of British educational history.
