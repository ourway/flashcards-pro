The Norman Conquest in 1066 brought massive changes to England, and William the Conqueror wanted to know exactly what he had gained. To achieve this, he commissioned a comprehensive survey of England in 1086. This survey, known as the Domesday Book, meticulously recorded land ownership, resources, and the people living in each area. Think of it as a detailed snapshot of England at that time. It listed who owned what, how many animals they had, the value of the land, and even the number of free men and slaves. This information allowed William to establish taxes and understand the wealth of his new kingdom. The other options are important historical documents, but they came later and served different purposes. The Book of Common Prayer is a religious text from the 16th century, The Canterbury Tales is a collection of stories from the late 14th century, and the Magna Carta is a charter of rights from 1215. So, the Domesday Book stands alone as the resource providing a detailed picture of life in England shortly after the Norman Conquest.
