The Good Friday Agreement, also known as the Belfast Agreement, was a pivotal moment in Northern Ireland's history, aiming to bring an end to decades of conflict known as "The Troubles." This agreement, signed in 1998, involved the British and Irish governments, as well as most of the political parties in Northern Ireland. The core of the agreement was establishing a new form of devolved government in Northern Ireland, one that would share power between the unionist and nationalist communities. This led directly to the creation of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Assembly is a democratically elected body responsible for making laws on a wide range of issues, from health and education to the environment and social services. It's a key institution designed to ensure that both sides of the community have a voice in how Northern Ireland is governed. While devolution of powers also occurred in Wales and Scotland, these were separate processes and not a direct result of the Good Friday Agreement. The agreement was specifically about Northern Ireland and its unique political situation.
