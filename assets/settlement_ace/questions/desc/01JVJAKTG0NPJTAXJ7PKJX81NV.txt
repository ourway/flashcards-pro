The fight for women's suffrage in Britain really gained momentum in the early 20th century. Before then, women had very limited rights, especially when it came to voting. Several groups campaigned peacefully for change, but a more radical movement emerged, believing direct action was needed. This is where Emmeline Pankhurst comes in. In 1903, frustrated with the lack of progress, she co-founded the Women's Social and Political Union, or WSPU. This group, whose members were known as suffragettes, adopted more confrontational tactics like protests, civil disobedience, and even hunger strikes to draw attention to their cause. While other individuals were involved in social and political movements of the time, such as Rudyard Kipling as a writer, Clement Attlee and William Beveridge as politicians and social reformers, Emmeline Pankhurst is the one directly associated with leading the suffragette movement and establishing the WSPU. Her dedication and the WSPU's actions played a crucial role in eventually securing voting rights for women in Britain.
