The Northern Ireland Assembly is a really important part of how Northern Ireland is governed, especially considering its history. After a long period of conflict and direct rule from London, the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 paved the way for a power-sharing government. The Assembly is where elected representatives from different political parties come together to make laws and decisions for Northern Ireland. Now, here's the key: the Assembly is made up of 108 members, known as Members of the Legislative Assembly, or MLAs. This number was actually reduced from 128 in 2017 as part of an effort to streamline the political process. So, while you might see higher numbers floating around, 108 is the current correct figure. It's a good number to remember because it represents the people who are directly elected to represent their communities and shape the future of Northern Ireland.
