For centuries after the Norman conquest in 1066, French was the language of the English aristocracy, law, and government. Think about it: William the Conqueror and his successors were from Normandy, so French naturally dominated the upper echelons of society. Latin was also widely used, especially in official documents and the Church. It wasn't until the 14th century that English began to regain prominence. Several factors contributed to this shift, including the Hundred Years' War with France, which fostered a sense of English national identity, and the rise of a new middle class who spoke English. By the 1400s, English had indeed become the language of Parliament and the royal court, with official documents increasingly being written in English. So, while it's tempting to think English took over earlier, by 1600, it was already well-established as the primary language, having made its comeback a couple of centuries before.
