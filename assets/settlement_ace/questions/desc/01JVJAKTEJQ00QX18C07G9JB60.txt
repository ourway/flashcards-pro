School governors and school boards are essentially the strategic leaders of a school. Think of them as a school's board of directors. Their role isn't about the day-to-day operations like grading homework or planning lessons. Instead, they focus on the bigger picture. They're responsible for setting the school's overall aims and values, ensuring the school is performing well, and holding the headteacher to account. This includes making decisions about the school's budget, staffing, and long-term goals. So, while governors might visit classrooms or attend school events, their primary responsibility is to set the strategic direction, ensuring the school is providing the best possible education for its students. It's easy to see how someone might think they help with lesson plans, but that's really the job of the experienced teachers and the headteacher. Governors are there to provide oversight and guidance, not to micromanage the teaching staff.
