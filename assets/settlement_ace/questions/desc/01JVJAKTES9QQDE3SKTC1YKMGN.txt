The Elizabethan era, named after Queen Elizabeth I who reigned from 1558 to 1603, was a period of significant exploration and expansion for England. While England had dabbled in exploration before, it was during Elizabeth's reign that serious attempts at colonization began. The focus was on the eastern coast of North America because other European powers, like Spain and France, had already laid claim to territories further south and inland. England wanted a piece of the "New World," and the eastern coast, with its promise of resources and new trade routes, seemed like the most accessible option. Think of figures like Sir Walter Raleigh, who attempted to establish colonies like Roanoke (though unsuccessfully at first). This was the beginning of England's long and complex relationship with North America, eventually leading to the establishment of the thirteen colonies. While England certainly had interests in other parts of the world later on, like India, those large-scale colonial efforts came much later, primarily in the 17th and 18th centuries.
