The role of the monarch in the UK is often misunderstood, so let's clarify. The UK operates under a constitutional monarchy, which means the King or Queen reigns, but doesn't rule. Think of it this way: their power is largely symbolic. Historically, monarchs held significant political power, but over centuries, particularly after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, power shifted towards Parliament. Now, after a general election, the monarch invites the leader of the party who can command the confidence of the House of Commons – usually the party with the majority of seats – to become Prime Minister and form a government. So, while the King or Queen formally appoints the government, they're acting on the democratic will of the people as expressed through the election results. They don't get to choose who they *want*; they appoint who *has* been chosen by the electorate. This ensures the government is accountable to the people, not the monarch.
