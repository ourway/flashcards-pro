William of Orange's story is central to understanding British history, particularly the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Before becoming King William III of England, Scotland, and Ireland, he was the Stadtholder (chief magistrate) of the Netherlands, a key figure in resisting French expansion under Louis XIV. He was a staunch Protestant, and his marriage to Mary, the Protestant daughter of King James II, made him a figurehead for those in England who feared James's Catholic leanings. When prominent English figures invited William to take the throne, he landed in England with an army, leading to James II's flight. This event, known as the Glorious Revolution, was largely bloodless and established a constitutional monarchy, limiting the power of the crown. So, William's prior role as a Protestant ruler in the Netherlands and his identity as William of Orange are both crucial pieces of his biography and explain his ascension to the British throne. He wasn't defeated by James II; rather, James fled. And while he was married to James II's daughter, that wasn't the primary reason he became king.
