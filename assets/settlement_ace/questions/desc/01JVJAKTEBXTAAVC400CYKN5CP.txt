Wales, with its distinct culture and language, is one of the four countries that make up the United Kingdom. Think of Wales and its Celtic roots, a history stretching back millennia, separate from England. The country is known for its stunning landscapes, from Snowdonia's mountains to the beautiful coastline. Swansea, a vibrant coastal city, is located in South Wales. It's the second-largest city in Wales, known for its maritime history, its connection to the poet Dylan Thomas, and its beautiful bay. So, while England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland are all part of the UK, Swansea is specifically situated within the borders of Wales, making that the only correct answer.
