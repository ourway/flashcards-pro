The Tower of London has a long and fascinating history, originally built by William the Conqueror after 1066. Over the centuries, it served many purposes: a royal palace, a prison, an armoury, and even a zoo! While it's famous for housing the Crown Jewels, it also has a darker side. The Tower was a place of imprisonment and execution for those who fell out of favour with the monarch. Anne Boleyn, one of Henry VIII's six wives, was famously beheaded there in 1536 after being accused of treason. Other notable figures, like Sir Thomas More, also met their end at the Tower. So, while the Houses of Parliament are where laws are made, Stonehenge is an ancient monument, and Whitehall is the centre of government, the Tower of London is the place most associated with high-profile executions, making it the correct answer in this case. It's a grim but important part of British history.
