Okay, let's talk about public holidays in the UK. You'll often hear them referred to as "Bank Holidays," and there's a specific reason for that name. Back in 1871, a banker and Liberal politician named Sir John Lubbock introduced the Bank Holidays Act. This act initially designated four holidays in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and five in Scotland. The key thing is that these were days when banks were legally closed. The idea was to give bank employees a break, but because banks were so central to commerce, it effectively became a holiday for many other people too. Even though the original act has been amended over time, the name "Bank Holiday" stuck. So, while "Workers Holidays," "Business Holidays," or "Summer Holidays" might sound plausible, they don't reflect the historical origin and official term for these public holidays in the UK. It's all about those banks taking a day off!
