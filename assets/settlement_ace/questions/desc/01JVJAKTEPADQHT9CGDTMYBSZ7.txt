The Puritans were a significant religious group in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly influential in both England and later, in the early American colonies. To understand their religious beliefs, it's crucial to know the context of the Reformation. This was a period of major upheaval in the Christian Church, starting in the early 1500s, which led to the emergence of Protestantism. Protestants, as the name suggests, were "protesting" against certain practices and doctrines of the Catholic Church. The Puritans were a specific group *within* Protestantism. They felt that the Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church, hadn't gone far enough in its reforms and still retained too many Catholic traditions. They wanted to "purify" the church, hence their name. So, while they had their own specific beliefs and practices, they were fundamentally part of the broader Protestant movement. That's why "Protestant" is the correct answer. The other options – Hindu, Catholic, and Sikh – represent entirely different religious traditions with no historical connection to the Puritans.
