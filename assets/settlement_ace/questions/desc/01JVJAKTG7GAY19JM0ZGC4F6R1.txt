Okay, so the question asks about the formation of the Scottish Parliament in 1998. While it's true that the late 1990s were a pivotal time for Scottish devolution, the actual date the Scottish Parliament was re-established was in 1999, specifically on July 1st. For nearly 300 years, Scotland didn't have its own parliament. It was dissolved in 1707 following the Acts of Union, which unified Scotland and England into Great Britain. The push for a Scottish Parliament grew stronger throughout the 20th century, culminating in a referendum in 1997 where the Scottish people voted overwhelmingly in favour of devolution. This paved the way for the Scotland Act of 1998, which created the framework for the new parliament. However, the first elections to the new Scottish Parliament weren't held until May 1999, and it officially convened in July of that year. So, while 1998 was the year the Act was passed, the Parliament itself didn't actually come into being until the following year.
