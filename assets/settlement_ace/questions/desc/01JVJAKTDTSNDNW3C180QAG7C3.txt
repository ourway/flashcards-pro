The Civil War, a pivotal moment in British history, happened in the 17th century, specifically from 1642 to 1651. It was a conflict between the Royalists, who supported King Charles I, and the Parliamentarians, who wanted more power for Parliament. Think of Oliver Cromwell and battles like Naseby – that’s the Civil War era. Now, the Chartists were a completely different movement, emerging much later in the 19th century, around the 1830s and 1840s. They were working-class reformers who campaigned for political rights and reforms outlined in their People's Charter, like universal male suffrage and secret ballots. So, while both periods involved political upheaval, they were separated by a couple of centuries and completely different issues. It's easy to get confused with so much history, but remembering the timeline helps. The Civil War was about the power of the monarchy versus Parliament, while the Chartists were focused on expanding voting rights for ordinary people.
