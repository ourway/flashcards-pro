The fight for women's suffrage in the UK was a long and hard-won battle. While 1918 is a significant year, it's important to remember that the Representation of the People Act of that year only granted voting rights to women over the age of 30 who met certain property qualifications. This was a huge step forward, acknowledging women's contributions during World War I, but it wasn't full equality. It wasn't until ten years later, in 1928, that the Equal Franchise Act was passed. This act lowered the voting age for women to 21, the same as men. So, while 1918 marked the beginning of women's suffrage, 1928 is the year when women finally achieved equal voting rights with men in the UK. Think of it this way: the "roaring twenties" weren't just about jazz and flappers; they were also a time of significant social and political change, including this landmark achievement for women's rights.
