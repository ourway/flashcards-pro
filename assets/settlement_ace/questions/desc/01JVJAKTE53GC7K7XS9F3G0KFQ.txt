The Great Plague was one of the worst outbreaks of bubonic plague in English history, and it's important to remember when it happened. Think of the 17th century, a time of immense change and hardship in Britain. The plague wasn't a one-off event; there were outbreaks throughout history, but the one that hit London in 1665 was particularly devastating. It killed an estimated 100,000 people, which was a huge proportion of London's population at the time. Now, it's easy to get this confused with other dates, but a helpful way to remember it is to associate it with another significant event: the Great Fire of London. The fire happened in 1666, just a year after the plague. The plague actually helped to set the stage for the fire, as the unsanitary conditions and overcrowding in London made it a breeding ground for disease. So, while 1465, 1565, and 1765 might sound plausible, 1665 is the year that the Great Plague truly ravaged London, right before the Great Fire changed the city forever.
