In the UK's political landscape, it's important to remember that no single party always holds all the power. Sometimes, to form a stable government, parties need to work together. This is what happened in 2010. After the general election that year, no single party had an overall majority of seats in the House of Commons. This situation, known as a hung parliament, meant that parties had to negotiate to form a coalition. The two parties that came together were the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives, traditionally a centre-right party, and the Liberal Democrats, who generally sit in the centre of the political spectrum, agreed to a power-sharing arrangement. This coalition lasted until 2015. While Labour is a major political party, they were not part of this particular coalition. The Communist Party has never held significant power in the UK. So, the correct answer is the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, who joined forces to govern the UK for five years.
