Okay, so selling tobacco to someone under 18 is indeed a criminal act in the UK, and here's why. The UK has strict laws to protect young people, and these laws extend to things like alcohol, cigarettes, and even lottery tickets. The rationale is that young people may not fully understand the risks associated with these products. The legal age for buying tobacco products, including cigarettes and vaping products, is 18. This law is in place to reduce smoking rates among young people and protect their health. It's been illegal to sell tobacco to under-18s since 2007, and shops that break this law can face hefty fines or even lose their license to sell tobacco. You might think that because some young people smoke, it's not a big deal, but the law is very clear on this. It's about preventing addiction and health problems in the long run. So, if you ever see someone selling tobacco to a minor, remember that they're committing a crime.
