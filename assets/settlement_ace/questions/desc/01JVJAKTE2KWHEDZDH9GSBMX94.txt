The Proms, short for the Promenade Concerts, is a classical music festival held every summer in London, primarily at the Royal Albert Hall. It's a celebrated event that runs for about eight weeks, featuring daily orchestral concerts and other musical performances. The BBC broadcasts many of these concerts, making classical music accessible to a wide audience. The Proms were founded in 1895 by Robert Newman and conductor Henry Wood, with the aim of bringing classical music to a broader public. Now, thinking about Easter, that's a Christian holiday that falls in the spring, marking the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The period leading up to Easter is called Lent, a time of fasting and reflection for Christians. So, while both The Proms and Easter are significant events, one is a summer music festival, and the other is a spring religious observance. They simply aren't related, which is why the statement is false.
