Okay, let's break down what you need to get a National Insurance number. Think of it as your personal tax ID in the UK. The government uses it to track your National Insurance contributions and taxes. Now, to get one, they need to verify two fundamental things: who you are and that you're allowed to work in the UK. That's why you need documents proving your identity, like a passport or birth certificate, and documents showing you have permission to work, such as a visa or work permit. A tenancy agreement, while useful for proving where you live, doesn't tell the government anything about your right to work. Similarly, a contract from your employer only shows you *have* a job, not that you're legally entitled to work in the UK. The National Insurance number is about your legal status and identity, not just your current employment or address.
