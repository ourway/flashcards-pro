General Elections in the UK are a cornerstone of the democratic process, determining who governs the country. The key thing to remember is that they don't happen every six years. Instead, they are held at least every five years. The reason it's 'at least' is because there are circumstances where an election might be called earlier, such as if the government loses a vote of no confidence or if the Prime Minister decides to call a snap election. This five-year cycle is enshrined in law through the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, although this act has been superseded, the five-year interval remains the norm. So, while a government *could* potentially serve a full five-year term, it's not guaranteed, and definitely not six. Thinking of the "five golden rings" in the song can be a handy way to remember this!
