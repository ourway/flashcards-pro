Henry VIII's marital life is one of the most talked-about aspects of Tudor history, and knowing the origins of his six wives is key to understanding the political landscape of the time. While Henry married women from various backgrounds, Anne of Cleves was not Spanish. She hailed from the Duchy of Cleves, a German-speaking territory. The marriage was arranged primarily for political reasons, to form an alliance against the Catholic Holy Roman Empire. Thomas Cromwell, Henry's chief minister at the time, promoted the match based on a portrait of Anne. Unfortunately, Henry found her unattractive upon arrival, and the marriage was quickly annulled. So, while Henry's wives included English nobles like Catherine Howard and Anne Boleyn, and even a Spanish princess in Catherine of Aragon, Anne of Cleves' German roots make the statement that she was Spanish false. It's easy to get the wives mixed up, but remembering Anne of Cleves' German origin helps keep the facts straight.
