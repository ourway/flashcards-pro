Halloween, celebrated on the 31st of October, has roots stretching back to ancient Celtic traditions. Specifically, it evolved from the Celtic festival of Samhain, which marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter â€“ a time of year often associated with death. The Celts believed that on the night of October 31st, the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead blurred. They would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off evil spirits. Over time, as Christianity spread, Samhain evolved into All Hallows' Eve, the night before All Saints' Day. The traditions of costumes, bonfires, and warding off spirits gradually transformed into the trick-or-treating and spooky celebrations we know today. So, while November 30th or 30th of October might seem like arbitrary dates, the 31st of October is specifically tied to this historical and cultural evolution from ancient Celtic beliefs to modern-day Halloween festivities.
