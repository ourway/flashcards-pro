The Scottish Grand National is a significant event in the horse racing calendar, steeped in history and Scottish sporting culture. Unlike its more famous English counterpart, the Grand National held at Aintree, the Scottish version has its own distinct identity and location. Ayr Racecourse, located in the town of Ayr on the west coast of Scotland, has been the home of the Scottish Grand National since 1966. Before that, it was held at Bogside Racecourse near Irvine. Ayr provides a fantastic setting for the race, drawing large crowds and contributing significantly to the local economy. While the Borders might evoke images of the Scottish countryside, and Berkshire is known for horse racing events like Royal Ascot, neither hosts this specific national race. Aintree is, of course, synonymous with the English Grand National, making Ayr the only correct answer for the Scottish version.
