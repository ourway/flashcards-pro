Okay, let's break down the Bill of Rights. Think of it as a really important rulebook created in 1689 after a bit of a shake-up in the monarchy. Basically, Parliament wasn't too happy with King James II, so they invited William of Orange and his wife Mary to take over, in what's known as the Glorious Revolution. But before they could become the new monarchs, Parliament made them agree to certain conditions outlined in the Bill of Rights. This document was a game-changer because it firmly established the rights of Parliament, like the freedom of speech within Parliament and the need for regular parliamentary elections. More importantly, it significantly limited the power of the monarch. For example, the King couldn't just suspend laws or impose taxes without Parliament's consent. So, the Bill of Rights was all about shifting the balance of power towards Parliament and ensuring the monarch couldn't act like an absolute ruler. That's why it's absolutely true that the Bill of Rights established the rights of Parliament and limited the King's power.
