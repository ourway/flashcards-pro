The Victoria Cross, Britain's highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy, has a fascinating origin story tied directly to the Crimean War. Before this conflict, which lasted from 1854 to 1856, bravery awards were typically reserved for officers. Ordinary soldiers rarely received recognition for their courage. Public sentiment, fueled by newspaper reports of incredible acts of valor during the Crimean War, pushed for a medal that all ranks could earn. Queen Victoria herself authorized the creation of the Victoria Cross in 1856, specifically to recognize the extraordinary heroism displayed during that war. It was designed to be a simple bronze cross, made from the metal of captured Russian cannons, emphasizing its connection to the Crimean War. While many other conflicts have seen Victoria Crosses awarded since, its inception is firmly rooted in the Crimean War, making that the only correct answer. The World Wars and Boer War all came later.
