Okay, so the idea of "Home Rule" for Ireland was a really big deal in the early 20th century. It essentially meant Ireland would have its own parliament to manage its own internal affairs, while still remaining part of the United Kingdom. The British government had actually promised this in 1913, but it never happened right away. The reason it was put on hold was because of the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Think about it: Britain was suddenly facing a massive global conflict, needing to mobilize its army, manage resources, and focus on international alliances. Domestic issues like Irish Home Rule, while important, had to take a back seat to the war effort. It was simply impossible to implement such a significant political change while the country was at war. Many Irishmen actually volunteered to fight for Britain in the war, partly in the hope that Home Rule would be granted after the war ended. Sadly, the issue became even more complicated after the war, eventually leading to the partition of Ireland.
