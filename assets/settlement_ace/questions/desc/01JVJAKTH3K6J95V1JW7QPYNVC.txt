Okay, let's talk about the Middle Ages. Following the Norman Conquest in 1066, England underwent a massive transformation. William the Conqueror and his Norman lords brought with them new systems of government, law, and land ownership, fundamentally changing the Anglo-Saxon way of life. This period, often called the medieval period or the Middle Ages, lasted for several centuries, right up until 1485. Think of the iconic imagery associated with this era: castles being built, knights in shining armor, the feudal system, and the rise of the Church's power. The Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, which marked the end of the Wars of the Roses, is generally considered the end of the Middle Ages in England and the start of the Tudor period. The Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages are all much, much earlier periods in British history, predating even the Romans, so they wouldn't be relevant to a period following the Norman Conquest.
