Okay, let's break down why Beowulf, "The Tyger," and "She Walks in Beauty" are all poems. Think about how literature developed over time. Beowulf, for example, is an Old English epic poem, dating back to around the 8th to 11th century. It's one of the most important works in Old English literature, originally passed down orally before being written down. Now, "The Tyger" is a famous poem by William Blake, written in 1794, and it's part of his "Songs of Experience" collection. It explores themes of creation and the nature of good and evil. Finally, "She Walks in Beauty" is a shorter, lyrical poem by Lord Byron, published in 1814, known for its romantic imagery and focus on inner and outer beauty. All three of these works use rhythm, rhyme, and figurative language to express ideas and emotions in a concentrated, artistic way. That's the core of what makes them poems, not plays which are meant to be acted out, films which are visual mediums, or novels which are longer, narrative prose works. The hint is a clue to help you connect the three literary works with the idea of poetry.
