Okay, let's talk about Hogmanay. In Scotland, Hogmanay, which is the celebration of New Year's Eve, holds a special place in many people's hearts, often taking precedence over Christmas. Historically, the celebration of Christmas was suppressed in Scotland following the Scottish Reformation in the 16th century, with the Church of Scotland discouraging its observance. This meant that for centuries, the focus shifted to the New Year celebrations, resulting in Hogmanay becoming a much more significant cultural event. Traditions associated with Hogmanay include first-footing, where the first person to cross the threshold of a home after midnight brings symbolic gifts like coal, shortbread, salt, or whisky to bring good fortune for the coming year. There are also fire festivals and street parties, making it a vibrant and communal celebration. While Halloween and Bonfire Night are also celebrated in the UK, and Boxing Day is a post-Christmas holiday, none hold the same cultural weight in Scotland as Hogmanay.
