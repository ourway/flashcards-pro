Okay, let's talk about Scotland's split from the Pope. To understand why 1560 is the key year, we need to remember the Reformation, a huge religious and political shakeup across Europe in the 16th century. People started questioning the authority of the Catholic Church, and new Protestant ideas spread rapidly. Scotland was no exception. The Scottish Reformation was driven by figures like John Knox, who preached against the Catholic Church. In 1560, the Scottish Parliament officially adopted the Protestant Confession of Faith and abolished papal authority. This was a monumental moment, essentially establishing Protestantism as the dominant religion in Scotland. So, while religious tensions and debates continued for many years afterward, 1560 marks the official legal break from the Pope's control. The other dates are incorrect because they don't align with this pivotal moment in Scottish religious history.
