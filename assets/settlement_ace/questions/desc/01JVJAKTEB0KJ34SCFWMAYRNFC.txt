Okay, let's delve into the history of Jewish settlement in England. For centuries, Jewish people were actually banned from living in England, all the way back in 1290, when they were expelled by King Edward I. This ban lasted for a really long time! It wasn't until the mid-17th century, specifically 1656, during the period of the English Commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell, that Jewish people were unofficially allowed to return and settle. Cromwell, influenced by economic and religious considerations, quietly permitted their resettlement, even though the ban was never officially lifted. So, 1656 marks a significant turning point, representing the first Jewish community to re-establish itself in London after a gap of over 350 years. This makes the statement true. It's important to remember that this resettlement was gradual and not without its challenges, but 1656 is the key date to remember.
