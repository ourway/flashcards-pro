The rules around gambling in the UK are designed to balance personal freedom with the need to protect vulnerable individuals. Historically, the age at which people could participate in various forms of gambling has shifted. For a long time, 18 was the standard age for most gambling activities. However, in 2021, the law changed specifically regarding the National Lottery and scratch cards. The government lowered the minimum age to purchase these items to 16. This decision was made after considering various factors, including the types of games involved and the potential for harm. So, while 18 remains the age for many other forms of gambling like casinos and betting shops, you can legally buy a lottery ticket or scratch card at 16. It's easy to get confused because 18 is such a common age for other legal milestones, but for the lottery, it's 16.
