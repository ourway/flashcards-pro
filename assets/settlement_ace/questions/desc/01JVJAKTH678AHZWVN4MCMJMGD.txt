Okay, let's break down National Insurance for self-employed individuals. National Insurance is essentially a contribution you make to the UK's social security system. It helps fund things like the NHS, state pensions, and unemployment benefits. Now, if you're employed by a company, your employer automatically deducts National Insurance contributions from your wages and pays it to the government on your behalf. However, when you're self-employed, you're essentially your own employer. This means you're responsible for calculating and paying your own National Insurance contributions. There are different classes of National Insurance, and self-employed people typically pay Class 2 and Class 4 contributions, depending on their profit levels. Class 2 is a flat weekly rate if your profits are above a certain threshold, and Class 4 is a percentage of your taxable profits. So, because you don't have an employer to handle this for you, the onus is on you to ensure these payments are made. It's a key part of being self-employed and understanding your financial obligations to the government.
