England's sole World Cup victory occurred in 1966, a moment etched in the nation's sporting memory. The tournament was hosted in England, adding to the pressure and excitement. The final was played at Wembley Stadium against West Germany and is remembered for its dramatic, nail-biting finish. The game went into extra time, and the score was tied. Geoff Hurst scored a controversial goal – whether the ball crossed the line is still debated today! – helping England secure a 4-2 victory. This win remains a significant cultural event, often referenced in British popular culture and representing a peak in English footballing history. While other years might seem plausible, especially if you're thinking of other successful footballing nations, 1966 is the only year England has ever won the World Cup.
