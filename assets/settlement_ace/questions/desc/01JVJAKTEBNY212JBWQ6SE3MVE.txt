Britain and France, despite being relatively close geographically, have a long and often turbulent history marked by numerous wars and conflicts. To say they've never been at war is simply untrue. Think back to major historical events like the Hundred Years' War, which actually lasted for 116 years from 1337 to 1453, involving English claims to the French throne. Then there were the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century, where Britain played a key role in defeating Napoleon. Even earlier, conflicts like the War of the Spanish Succession in the early 1700s saw Britain and France on opposing sides. While there have been periods of alliance and cooperation, particularly in more recent times, the historical record clearly demonstrates a recurring pattern of warfare between the two nations. So, the idea that they've never been at war is a significant oversimplification and ignores centuries of documented conflict.
