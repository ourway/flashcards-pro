Okay, let's dive into the world of Iron Age Britain and its coinage. Before the Romans rocked up, Britain was a patchwork of Iron Age tribes, each with their own territories and leaders. Coinage started appearing around 150 BC, influenced by contact with the continent. Now, these weren't like the coins we use today with standard national symbols. Instead, the very first coins were actually quite personal statements. They often featured the names of the Iron Age kings or chieftains who ruled the area where the coins were minted. This was a way for them to assert their authority and show their control over resources and trade. It's like a very early form of branding! While Iron Age people certainly had gods, revered nature, and animals, these weren't typically featured on the earliest coins. The focus was on the ruler himself, making his name the most prominent feature. So, when you think of the first British coins, think of them as mini-billboards declaring "King So-and-So was here!"
