The Magna Carta, sealed in 1215, is a cornerstone of British legal history and a symbol of liberty. Think of King John, not known for his popularity, being forced by rebellious barons to agree to a set of rules. Before the Magna Carta, the King was pretty much above the law, able to do as he pleased, which often meant heavy taxation and arbitrary justice. The barons, fed up with this, demanded limitations on his power. The key thing to remember is that the Magna Carta was all about limiting royal authority. It established the principle that everyone, including the King, was subject to the law. While it didn't create a modern democracy overnight, it set a crucial precedent. It ensured the King couldn't just imprison people or seize their property without due process. So, while it didn't directly focus on farmers' or women's rights in the way we understand them today, its core achievement was restricting the King's power, laying the groundwork for future legal and political reforms.
