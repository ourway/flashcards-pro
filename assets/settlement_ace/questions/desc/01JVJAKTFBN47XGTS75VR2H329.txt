The Vikings, those seafaring warriors and traders who left a significant mark on British history, hailed primarily from Scandinavia. Specifically, Denmark and Norway were major Viking homelands. Think of the long, narrow fjords of Norway, perfect for launching longships, and the coastal regions of Denmark, ideal for shipbuilding and seafaring. From around the 8th century to the 11th century, these Vikings raided, traded, and settled across Europe, including Britain. They established settlements, influenced language, and even ruled parts of England for a time. While other Scandinavian countries like Sweden also contributed to the Viking expansion, Denmark and Norway were central to the Viking presence in Britain. Germany, while geographically close, was not a primary origin point for Viking expeditions to the UK. Spain, much further south, was raided by Vikings but not a place they originated from. So, when you think of Vikings setting sail for Britain, picture those Danish and Norwegian coastlines as their starting point.
