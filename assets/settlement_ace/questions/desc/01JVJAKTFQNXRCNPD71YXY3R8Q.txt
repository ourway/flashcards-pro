Queen Elizabeth II reigned for over 70 years, making her the longest-reigning British monarch. Throughout her reign, a constant figure by her side was Prince Philip, her husband. Their marriage was a significant event in 1947, and he dedicated his life to supporting her in her royal duties. He was known for his strong personality and commitment to various causes, particularly those related to the environment and technology. While Prince Charles is her son and heir to the throne, and Princes William and Harry are her grandsons, none of them were her spouse. Prince Philip held the title of Duke of Edinburgh and played a crucial role in modernizing the monarchy. He passed away in 2021, leaving behind a legacy of service and devotion to the Queen and the United Kingdom. Remembering Prince Philip as the Queen's husband is a key part of understanding the modern British monarchy.
