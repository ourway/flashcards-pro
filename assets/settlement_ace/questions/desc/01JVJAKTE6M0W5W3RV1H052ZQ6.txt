Agriculture arrived in Britain relatively late compared to other parts of the world. The last Ice Age ended around 11,700 years ago, and for thousands of years after that, Britain was populated by hunter-gatherers. These early inhabitants lived off the land by hunting animals and foraging for wild plants. It wasn't until around 6,000 years ago, during the Neolithic period, that the first farmers arrived. These people migrated from mainland Europe, bringing with them domesticated animals like sheep and cattle, as well as crops such as wheat and barley. This marked a huge shift in how people lived, moving from a nomadic lifestyle to settled communities focused on agriculture. While there were people in Britain long before this, the introduction of farming fundamentally changed the landscape and the way of life. So, while 8,000 or 10,000 years ago might sound plausible for human habitation, it's 6,000 years ago that pinpoints the arrival of the first agricultural practices.
