The Wars of the Roses, a tumultuous period in English history during the 15th century, was essentially a power struggle for the English throne. Think of it as a massive family feud, but with crowns and armies involved! The two main families vying for control were the House of York and the House of Lancaster. These weren't just ordinary families; they were powerful royal houses, both descended from King Edward III. The House of York had a white rose as its emblem, while the House of Lancaster used a red rose, hence the name "Wars of the Roses." The conflict spanned several decades, from 1455 to 1487, and involved battles, betrayals, and shifting alliances. While the Irish and Scottish certainly had their own conflicts and interactions with England during this period, they weren't the central players in this particular dynastic struggle for the English throne. The Wars of the Roses ultimately ended with the victory of Henry Tudor, who became King Henry VII and united the two houses by marrying Elizabeth of York, symbolized by the Tudor rose, a combination of the red and white roses.
