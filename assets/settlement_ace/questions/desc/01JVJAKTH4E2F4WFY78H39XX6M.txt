Alright, let's talk about the Vikings and how England managed to push them back. The Viking age, roughly from the 8th to the 11th centuries, saw these Norse warriors raiding and settling in various parts of Britain. They controlled large areas, particularly in the north and east of England, known as the Danelaw. Now, several English kingdoms struggled against them, but it was the kingdom of Wessex, under King Alfred, that really turned the tide. Alfred, who reigned from 871 to 899, understood that unity was key. He reorganized the army, built fortified towns called burhs, and even created a navy to defend against Viking longships. His most famous victory was at the Battle of Edington in 878, which forced the Vikings to retreat and eventually led to a treaty that defined the boundaries of the Danelaw. So, while other kings certainly played roles in English history, it was King Alfred the Great who is remembered for uniting the English people and successfully resisting the Viking invasions, earning him the title "the Great." Henry I, Harold, and William came much later in English history, after the main Viking threat had subsided.
