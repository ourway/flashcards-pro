Charles I's reign in the 17th century was defined by his staunch belief in the 'Divine Right of Kings'. This wasn't just a personal quirk; it was a deeply held conviction that his authority to rule came directly from God, not from the people or Parliament. This idea clashed dramatically with the growing power of Parliament, which wanted a say in how the country was governed, especially when it came to raising taxes. Because Charles believed his power was divinely ordained, he felt he didn't need Parliament's approval. He repeatedly tried to bypass them, raising money through unpopular methods and making decisions without their consent. This ultimately led to a breakdown in relations, sparking the English Civil War. So, the outcome of Charles I's belief in the Divine Right of Kings was his attempt to rule without the Parliament, a decision that had huge consequences for British history. The other options are incorrect because they directly contradict Charles's actions and beliefs, which were all about asserting his absolute authority.
