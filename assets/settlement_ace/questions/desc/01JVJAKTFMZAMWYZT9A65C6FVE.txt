St. Andrew's Day, celebrated on November 30th, is Scotland's official national day and honors St. Andrew, the patron saint of Scotland. St. Andrew was one of Jesus's apostles, and interestingly, he's also the patron saint of Greece, Russia, and Barbados, among other places. The connection to Scotland is a bit murky, but legend has it that some of his relics were brought to Scotland in the 4th century. Over time, he became a symbol of Scottish identity and pride. While not as widely celebrated as Burns Night or Hogmanay (New Year's Eve), St. Andrew's Day is a public holiday in Scotland, marked by ceilidhs, feasts, and other celebrations of Scottish culture. So, remembering that St. Andrew's Day falls right before December helps you pinpoint the correct date: November 30th. The other dates listed are significant in other contexts – St. David's Day (Wales) is on March 1st, for example – but only November 30th is dedicated to Scotland's patron saint.
