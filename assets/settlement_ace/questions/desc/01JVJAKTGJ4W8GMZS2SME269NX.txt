The Battle of the Somme, a major battle of World War One, began on 1 July 1916. It was intended to achieve a decisive victory for the British and French against the German Empire. The first day of the Somme is infamous for being the bloodiest day in British military history. The British forces, many of whom were inexperienced volunteers, faced heavy German machine-gun fire as they advanced across open ground. The scale of the losses was staggering. While other battles had high casualty rates, the sheer number on this single day makes it particularly memorable. The British suffered approximately 60,000 casualties on that first day, including around 20,000 dead. While the other options represent significant losses, they don't reflect the truly devastating scale of that single day at the Somme.
