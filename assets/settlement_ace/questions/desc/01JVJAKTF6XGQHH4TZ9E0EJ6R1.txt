When you head to a polling station to cast your vote in the UK, the process is designed to be straightforward and secure. The officials there need to confirm that you are who you say you are and that you are registered to vote at that specific location. This is primarily done to prevent voter fraud and ensure the integrity of the election. So, the only information they'll ask for is your name and address. This allows them to check the electoral register and verify your eligibility to vote at that particular polling station. They don't need your age, phone number, or other contact details because the register already contains all the necessary information to confirm your identity and voting rights. It's all about verifying you against the official record for that address.
