Florence Nightingale, a prominent figure in the 19th century, is primarily celebrated for her groundbreaking contributions to nursing and healthcare reform, not children's education. During the Crimean War in the 1850s, she famously organized and improved sanitary conditions in British military hospitals, dramatically reducing death rates. Her work highlighted the importance of hygiene and patient care, leading to significant advancements in nursing practices. Nightingale established the Nightingale Training School for Nurses at St. Thomas' Hospital in London in 1860, setting a new standard for nurse education. While education was important in the 19th century, and many women contributed to it, Florence Nightingale's legacy is firmly rooted in her pioneering work in the medical field, making the statement about her fame relating to children's education incorrect.
