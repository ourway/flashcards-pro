Alright, let's talk about the Tower of London. This iconic structure wasn't just built on a whim; it was a strategic move by William the Conqueror following his successful invasion in 1066. Think of it as a very visible symbol of Norman power and control over London and England. William needed to establish authority quickly, and a formidable castle was the perfect way to do it. Construction began around 1078, initially as a wooden structure before being rebuilt in stone. Now, while later monarchs like Henry VIII certainly made their mark on the Tower – adding to its history with imprisonments and executions – they didn't build the original structure. The Henrys and Edward I came along centuries later. So, when you think of the Tower of London's origins, remember William the Conqueror's need to assert his dominance after the Norman Conquest.
