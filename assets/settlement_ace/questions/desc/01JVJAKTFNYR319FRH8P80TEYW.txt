Okay, so after Queen Anne died in 1714, the situation was a bit complicated because she didn't have any surviving children. The Act of Settlement in 1701 had already laid out the plan for who would succeed her, and it was pretty specific: the heir had to be a Protestant. This was crucial because there was a real fear of a Catholic monarch taking the throne again, which had caused a lot of turmoil in the past. So, the closest Protestant relative was George of Hanover, who was a German prince. He spoke very little English, and he was more familiar with German customs, but he became King George I of Great Britain. This marked the beginning of the Hanoverian dynasty, which included famous monarchs like George III, who was king during the American Revolution, and Queen Victoria, who was actually George III's granddaughter. So, yes, a German, George of Hanover, did indeed become the King of England after Queen Anne.
