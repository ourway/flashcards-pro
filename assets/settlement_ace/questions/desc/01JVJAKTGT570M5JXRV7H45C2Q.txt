Horse racing has a long and celebrated history in the UK, evolving from informal local races to highly organized national events. Royal Ascot, for example, has been a highlight of the British social calendar since 1711, founded by Queen Anne. It's not just about the racing; it's a spectacle of fashion and tradition, attracting huge crowds and media attention. The Scottish Grand National, first run in 1858, is another key event, known for its challenging course and the skill required to navigate it. It's a major event in Scotland, drawing enthusiastic crowds and showcasing the country's passion for horse racing. While the Six Nations Championship is a major rugby tournament and The Open Championship is a prestigious golf competition, neither are horse-racing events. Therefore, the Scottish Grand National and Royal Ascot are the prominent horse-racing events that draw large crowds in the UK.
