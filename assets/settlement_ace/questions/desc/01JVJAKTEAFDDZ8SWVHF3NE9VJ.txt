To understand why the electoral register is the key here, it's helpful to know how the jury system works in the UK. Serving on a jury is a really important civic duty, a way for ordinary people to participate directly in the justice system. Now, the courts need a way to select potential jurors, and they do this randomly from the electoral register. This register is basically a list of all the people who are registered to vote in elections. Because registering to vote is something most adult citizens do, it provides a broad and representative pool of people to choose from. So, if you want to be considered for jury service, making sure you're on the electoral register is essential. It's not something you sign up for directly with the courts or any other organization. While churches and the NHS are important institutions, they have nothing to do with jury selection. And the British Embassy is for diplomatic matters, not domestic legal processes.
