Okay, let's break down the monarch's role in Parliament. The British monarchy, while not involved in the day-to-day running of the government, still holds significant ceremonial duties. Think of the monarch as the symbolic head of state. One of the most important of these duties is the State Opening of Parliament, which usually happens every year. During this ceremony, the monarch reads the Queen's Speech (now the King's Speech, of course!). This speech is actually written by the government, and it outlines the government's plans for the coming year. The monarch's role is to deliver it, symbolizing the government's accountability to the Crown. The monarch also formally declares Parliament open and then, at the end of the parliamentary session, formally closes it. So, because these ceremonial duties of opening and closing Parliament and reading the Queen's Speech are indeed performed by the monarch, the statement is true. It's a key part of their symbolic role in the British political system.
