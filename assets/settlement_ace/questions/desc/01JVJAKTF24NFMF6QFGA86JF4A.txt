Mary Tudor, daughter of Henry VIII, reigned as Queen Mary I of England from 1553 to 1558. Her nickname, "Bloody Mary," stems from her zealous efforts to reverse the English Reformation and restore Catholicism as the state religion. England had become officially Protestant under her father, Henry VIII, and then further so under her half-brother, Edward VI. Mary, a devout Catholic, sought to undo these changes. During her relatively short reign, she ordered the execution of numerous Protestant leaders and dissenters, burning them at the stake for heresy. It's estimated that around 300 people were executed during her reign for their religious beliefs. This intense persecution, aimed at stamping out Protestantism, earned her the infamous moniker "Bloody Mary." While "Catholic Mary" is accurate, it doesn't reflect the specific reason for her notoriety. The other options are simply incorrect and have no historical basis.
