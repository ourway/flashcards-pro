Okay, let's break down why the UK is indeed a constitutional monarchy. Think back to British history â€“ for centuries, the monarch held real power. But over time, especially after events like the English Civil War in the 17th century, power gradually shifted towards Parliament. The key word here is "constitutional." This means the monarch's powers are defined and limited by laws and customs, the "constitution," even though the UK doesn't have a single written document called the Constitution. The monarch, currently King Charles III, is Head of State, but the elected government, led by the Prime Minister, runs the country. The monarch still has important symbolic roles, like opening Parliament and approving legislation, but they act on the advice of the government. So, while the UK has a monarch, their power is largely symbolic, making it a constitutional monarchy where the real political power resides with the elected representatives of the people.
