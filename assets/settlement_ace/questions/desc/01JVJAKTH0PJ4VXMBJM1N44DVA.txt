Female Genital Mutilation, or FGM, is a deeply harmful practice with no medical benefits. It involves intentionally altering or injuring female genitalia for non-medical reasons. Because of the severe physical and psychological harm it causes, FGM is considered a violation of human rights. The UK has specifically outlawed FGM to protect women and girls. The law doesn't just apply to acts committed within the UK; it also makes it a crime to take a woman or girl abroad for FGM, even if the procedure is legal in that other country. This is because the UK government recognizes its responsibility to safeguard its citizens from this harmful practice, regardless of where it occurs. So, the statement is true because UK law actively criminalizes both performing FGM within the country and taking someone abroad to undergo it.
