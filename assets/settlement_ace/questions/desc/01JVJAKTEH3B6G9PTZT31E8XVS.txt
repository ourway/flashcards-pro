Stonehenge, that iconic circle of massive stones, is located in Wiltshire, a county in southwest England. This prehistoric monument dates back thousands of years, with construction starting around 3000 BC. It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most famous landmarks in the UK, drawing visitors from all over the world. Wiltshire itself is largely a rural county, known for its rolling hills and picturesque villages, which makes it a fitting home for such an ancient and mysterious site. While Berkshire is a neighboring county, it doesn't house Stonehenge. Lancashire is way up north in the northwest of England, and Lothian is actually in Scotland, so neither of those are correct either. So, if you're ever planning a trip to see Stonehenge, you'll need to head to Wiltshire!
