The legal age for purchasing and consuming alcohol in the UK is 18. This law is pretty consistent across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. While some countries have exceptions allowing younger individuals to drink in specific circumstances, like with parental consent or during a meal, the UK doesn't have those exceptions. So, even if you're 16 or 17 and having a fancy dinner at a hotel or restaurant, it's still illegal for you to be served or consume alcohol. You might be thinking of other European countries where the rules are more relaxed, but in the UK, the law is clear: you have to be 18 to legally drink.
