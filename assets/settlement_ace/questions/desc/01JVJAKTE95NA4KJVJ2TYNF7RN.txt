British literature boasts a rich tapestry of talented authors, and Thomas Hardy and Graham Greene are two prominent figures woven into its fabric. Hardy, writing primarily in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, is renowned for his novels set in the fictional region of Wessex, a thinly veiled version of southwest England. His works, like "Tess of the d'Urbervilles" and "Far from the Madding Crowd," explore themes of social class, fate, and the challenges of rural life. Graham Greene, on the other hand, is a 20th-century author known for his thrillers and novels that often grapple with moral and political issues. His famous works include "Brighton Rock," "The Power and the Glory," and "The Quiet American." Both authors have left a lasting impact on English literature and are widely studied and admired. While Mary Quant was a hugely influential fashion designer who helped popularize the miniskirt in the 1960s, and Henry Moore was a celebrated sculptor known for his abstract bronze figures, neither are known for their literary contributions.
