The anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne, observed on 12th July, *is* indeed a public holiday in Northern Ireland. Often referred to as "The Twelfth," it commemorates the victory of Protestant King William of Orange over Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. This battle was a pivotal moment in the Williamite War in Ireland, solidifying Protestant dominance. The holiday is primarily celebrated by the Protestant community, particularly members of the Orange Order, who organize parades and demonstrations. These parades can be quite large and involve marching bands, banners, and displays of Orange Order symbolism. While it's a day of celebration for some, it's also a source of contention and sensitivity for others due to its historical and political associations. So, while it might seem like a simple historical event, its lasting impact makes it a significant and legally recognized public holiday in Northern Ireland.
