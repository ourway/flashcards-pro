The judiciary is a crucial part of the UK's system of government, acting as an independent body that interprets and applies the law. Think of it as the branch that makes sure laws are fairly understood and consistently applied. In the UK, laws are primarily created by Parliament â€“ that's the MPs who debate and vote on legislation. However, laws can sometimes be complex or unclear, and that's where the judiciary comes in. Judges, who make up the judiciary, are experts in law. Their job is to examine cases, interpret the relevant laws, and make rulings based on their understanding of those laws. They ensure that laws are applied correctly in specific situations, resolving disputes and upholding justice. So, while MPs create the laws, and other groups might try to influence them, it's the judges who are responsible for interpreting them. This separation of powers is fundamental to the UK's democratic system.
