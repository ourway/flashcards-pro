The Bayeux Tapestry is a massive, embroidered cloth nearly 70 metres long that vividly tells a story through pictures. Think of it like a medieval comic strip! It's a crucial historical source because it depicts the events leading up to, and including, the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. The central event illustrated is the Battle of Hastings, where William the Conqueror's Norman forces defeated the English army led by King Harold. This victory was a turning point in English history, leading to significant changes in language, law, and culture. While the Battle of Waterloo (1815) involved the Duke of Wellington defeating Napoleon, the Battle of Trafalgar (1805) saw Nelson defeat the French navy, and the Battle of Britain (1940) was a crucial air battle during World War II, none of these are depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry. The tapestry is specifically focused on the Norman Conquest and the Battle of Hastings, making it the only correct answer.
