Okay, let's talk about why Charles I is the monarch who famously stormed into the House of Commons. To understand this, we need to rewind to the 17th century, a time of intense power struggles between the monarchy and Parliament. Charles I believed in the Divine Right of Kings, the idea that he was appointed by God and therefore shouldn't be questioned. However, Parliament was increasingly asserting its authority, especially over matters of taxation and law. Tensions escalated as Charles repeatedly clashed with Parliament, dissolving it multiple times when they challenged his policies. In 1642, Charles, believing five leading members of Parliament were plotting against him, took the unprecedented step of entering the House of Commons with armed guards to arrest them. This brazen act was seen as a gross violation of parliamentary privilege and a direct attack on the rights of the people's representatives. It was a pivotal moment that ignited the English Civil War, pitting the Royalists against the Parliamentarians. So, while James I and James II were also significant monarchs, neither took such a dramatic and confrontational step. And Oliver Cromwell, though a powerful figure, was never a monarch. Charles I's actions were a key turning point in the struggle for power between the crown and Parliament.
