Okay, so the Church of England has a fascinating global presence, and its identity shifts a bit depending on where you are. When English settlers, many of whom were members of the Church of England, arrived in America, they eventually established their own version of the church. After the American Revolution, it was no longer appropriate to be part of the Church of England, which was headed by the British monarch. So, they formed an independent church, but one that still maintained the same traditions, doctrines, and structure. They chose the name "Episcopal Church." The word "episcopal" comes from the Greek word for "bishop," highlighting the importance of bishops in the church's governance. While the term "Anglican" is often used as a broader term to describe churches that are part of the worldwide Anglican Communion, which includes both the Church of England and the Episcopal Church, the specific name used in the United States is the Episcopal Church. It's a subtle but important distinction!
