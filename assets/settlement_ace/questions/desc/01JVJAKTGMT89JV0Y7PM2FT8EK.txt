Okay, let's delve into the history behind the nickname "The Tories" for the Conservative Party. The term "Tory" actually dates back to the 17th century, during a period of intense political and religious upheaval. Originally, it was used to describe people who supported the idea that the heir to the throne should be Catholic, specifically James, Duke of York (later King James II). Think of it as a label for those who favored the traditional line of succession and the established Church. Over time, the term evolved to represent those who generally supported the monarchy and the established social order.

Now, fast forward to the 19th century, and you see the emergence of the modern Conservative Party. They essentially inherited the mantle of the old Tory party, advocating for similar principles of tradition, property rights, and a strong national identity. So, while the official name is "Conservative Party," the nickname "Tories" stuck around as a shorthand, a way to connect the modern party with its historical roots. It's a bit like a family nickname that's been passed down through generations. The other options are incorrect because the Whigs were a rival political faction to the Tories in the 17th and 18th centuries, the Jacobites were supporters of the exiled Stuart monarchs, and the Peers refers to members of the House of Lords, not a specific political party.
