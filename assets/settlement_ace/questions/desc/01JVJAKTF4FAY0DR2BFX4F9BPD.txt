Juries are a cornerstone of the UK legal system, ensuring trials are judged by ordinary citizens. The idea is that a group of people representing the community can provide a fairer verdict than a single judge, especially in criminal cases. Now, while the number might seem arbitrary, historically, juries in England were formalized with 12 members way back in the 14th century! This number became deeply ingrained in the legal tradition. So, when we talk about juries in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, it's almost always a panel of 12. However, there's a key exception: Scotland. Scottish juries actually have 15 members, a slightly larger group. Therefore, the statement that all UK juries have 12 members is incorrect because it doesn't account for the different legal system in Scotland. It's a detail that highlights the UK's diverse legal landscape.
