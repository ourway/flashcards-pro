Think about the impact of individual choices on the environment. Cars, while convenient, contribute significantly to air pollution through exhaust emissions. Each car emits pollutants like carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. Now, consider public transportation. A bus, for example, carries many people at once. While it also emits pollutants, the emissions are spread out across all the passengers. So, the pollution *per person* is much lower compared to everyone driving their own car. Walking, of course, produces zero emissions! Therefore, choosing to walk or use public transport like buses and trains reduces the overall environmental impact compared to everyone driving individual cars. It's all about efficiency and sharing resources to minimize pollution.
