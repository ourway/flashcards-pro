Okay, let's break down why Charles, King of Scotland, becoming King Charles II of England in 1660 is the correct statement. To understand this, we need to rewind to the mid-17th century. England had been through a period of upheaval with the English Civil War, which led to the execution of King Charles I in 1649. Following this, England became a republic, known as the Commonwealth, under Oliver Cromwell. However, this didn't last. After Cromwell's death, there was a desire to restore the monarchy. Charles I's son, Charles, who had already been crowned King of Scotland, was invited back to England to take the throne. This event, known as the Restoration, occurred in 1660, marking the end of the Commonwealth and the return of the monarchy. So, Charles, already a king, became King Charles II of England, uniting the crowns once again. Now, it's easy to get Charles II mixed up with Bonnie Prince Charlie, but he came later, in the 18th century, and never actually became king.
