Okay, here's an explanation for why it's false to say everyone living in the UK can vote in all elections. Think about it this way: voting in the UK isn't just about living there; it's about citizenship and age. Generally, to vote in a UK general election, you need to be a British citizen, a qualifying Commonwealth citizen, or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland. Plus, you absolutely have to be 18 or over. So, a French tourist visiting London, or even a permanent resident from India who hasn't become a British citizen, can't vote in the general election, even though they're living in the UK. Similarly, a 16-year-old, even if they're British, isn't eligible. While some elections, like local elections, might have slightly different rules regarding who can vote, the key takeaway is that not *everyone* residing in the UK has the right to vote in *all* elections. It's a privilege tied to citizenship, age, and sometimes residency status, depending on the specific election.
