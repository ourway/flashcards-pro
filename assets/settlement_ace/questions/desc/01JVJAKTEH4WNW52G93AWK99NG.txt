Wimbledon holds a truly unique place in the world of tennis. Its history stretches all the way back to 1877, making it the oldest tennis tournament on the planet. Think about that – it predates almost every other major sporting event we know today! But it's not just about age; Wimbledon is also the only one of the four 'Grand Slam' tournaments – the others being the Australian Open, the French Open, and the US Open – that's still played on grass courts. Grass was the original surface for tennis, and Wimbledon has proudly maintained that tradition. While Andy Murray's wins are certainly memorable for British fans, they don't define the tournament's core identity. And while Wimbledon is a major tournament, it is not the only one held outside the US. So, the combination of being the oldest and the only grass court Grand Slam is what truly sets Wimbledon apart.
