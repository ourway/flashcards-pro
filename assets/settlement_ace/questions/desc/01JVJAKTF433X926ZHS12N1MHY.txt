December 26th is not the day celebrating Jesus Christ's birth; that's actually Christmas Day, December 25th. The celebration of Christmas on December 25th is a tradition that developed over time. While the Bible doesn't specify an exact date for Jesus's birth, the early Church in Rome began celebrating it on December 25th in the 4th century. This date may have been chosen to coincide with existing winter solstice festivals. So, while Christmas Day is the day traditionally associated with celebrating Jesus's birth, December 26th is known as Boxing Day in the UK and some other countries. Boxing Day has its own history, possibly stemming from the tradition of giving gifts to servants and tradespeople on the day after Christmas. It's a bank holiday in the UK, often spent watching sports or continuing the Christmas festivities.
