The BBC, or British Broadcasting Corporation, is a unique institution in the UK. Unlike many broadcasters around the world, it's not funded by advertising or directly by the government. Instead, its main source of income is the TV licence fee. This fee is a legal requirement for anyone who watches or records live TV programmes, or uses BBC iPlayer, regardless of the device they use. The idea behind the licence fee, which dates back to the early days of radio broadcasting in the 1920s, is to ensure the BBC remains independent from commercial or political pressures. This allows it to create a wide range of programming, from news and documentaries to drama and children's shows, without having to chase ratings or appease advertisers. While the government does set the level of the licence fee, the BBC's editorial decisions are meant to be free from government influence. So, while the government does play a role in setting the license fee, it is the TV licenses themselves that are the primary source of funding.
