Christmas pudding, also known as plum pudding, is the traditional dessert served on Christmas Day in the UK. Its origins can be traced back to medieval England, evolving from a savory dish called "frumenty" made with beef, mutton, raisins, currants, and spices. Over time, it transformed into a sweeter, fruit-filled pudding. The Victorians really cemented its place in Christmas tradition, with recipes becoming more elaborate and symbolic. The pudding is typically dark, rich, and dense, containing dried fruits, nuts, spices, and often suet (animal fat). A key part of the tradition is the "stir-up Sunday" ritual, where family members take turns stirring the pudding mixture and making a wish. It's often doused in brandy and set alight before serving, adding a theatrical flourish to the Christmas feast. While spotted dick is a classic British pudding, it's not specifically associated with Christmas. Christmas cake is popular, but it's more of an accompaniment than the central dessert. Christmas pie is not a traditional dish.
