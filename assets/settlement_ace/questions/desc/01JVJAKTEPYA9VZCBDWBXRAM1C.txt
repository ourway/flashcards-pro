Hogmanay is the Scottish word for the last day of the year, or New Year's Eve. The celebration of Hogmanay is a huge part of Scottish culture, dating back to pagan winter festivals. It's thought to have Norse and Gaelic origins, with traditions like cleansing the house, paying first-foot visits, and lighting bonfires to ward off evil spirits and welcome the new year. These traditions have evolved over centuries, blending with Christian influences. The name itself is a bit of a mystery, with theories linking it to Norse, Gaelic, and even French words. What's important is that Hogmanay is much more than just New Year's Eve in Scotland; it's a unique cultural event filled with history and tradition. So, while "Hogsback" might sound vaguely Scottish, it's actually a geographical term, and "Hogwarts" is, of course, from the Harry Potter series, Hogmanay is the only answer that reflects the Scottish celebration of the New Year.
