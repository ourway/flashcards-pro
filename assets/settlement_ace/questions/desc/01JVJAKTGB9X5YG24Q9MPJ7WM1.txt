Historically, the House of Lords, composed of nobles and clergy, indeed held more power than the House of Commons. Think back to the medieval period and the early days of Parliament. The Lords were often wealthy landowners and influential figures close to the monarch. They inherited their positions, giving them a sense of entitlement and authority. The Commons, on the other hand, was initially made up of representatives of towns and shires, and their influence grew more slowly over time. For centuries, the Lords could veto laws passed by the Commons. It wasn't until the 20th century, particularly with the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949, that the power of the Lords was significantly curtailed, giving the elected House of Commons the upper hand in most legislative matters. So, while today the Commons is the dominant chamber, in the past, the House of Lords was undoubtedly more powerful.
