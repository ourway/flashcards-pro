Devolution in the UK, which started in the late 1990s, involved transferring certain powers from the UK Parliament in Westminster to national assemblies and parliaments in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. This was designed to give these regions more control over their own affairs, like healthcare, education, and local government. Now, to effectively manage these devolved powers, each administration needs its own dedicated civil service. Think of it like this: the Scottish Government needs civil servants who understand Scottish law and policy, just as the Welsh Government needs experts in Welsh-specific issues. These civil servants are responsible for advising ministers, implementing policies, and delivering public services within their respective devolved areas. So, it's indeed accurate to say that each devolved administration has its own distinct civil service because they each require a dedicated and specialized workforce to effectively govern their devolved responsibilities. While the UK civil service as a whole provides support and guidance, these devolved bodies operate independently with their own staff.
