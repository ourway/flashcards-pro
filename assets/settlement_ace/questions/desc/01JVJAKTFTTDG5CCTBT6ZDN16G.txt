The Scottish Parliament, established in 1999, operates under a system of devolved powers. Think of it like this: the UK Parliament in Westminster retains control over certain key areas, like foreign policy, defence, and some aspects of economic policy. These are called "reserved powers." However, the Scottish Parliament has the authority to legislate on anything *not* specifically reserved to Westminster. This includes important areas like education, healthcare, and criminal justice. So, while the Scottish Parliament has significant power and can create laws that are very different from those in England and Wales, its authority isn't unlimited. It can't, for example, declare war or negotiate international treaties. The system is designed to balance national unity with regional autonomy, allowing Scotland to address its unique needs and priorities within the framework of the United Kingdom. A common misconception is that the Scottish Parliament has complete control over all matters within Scotland, but the "reserved powers" principle ensures the UK Parliament maintains a degree of oversight.
