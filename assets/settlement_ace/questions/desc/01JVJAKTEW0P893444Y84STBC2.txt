Okay, let's talk about the Tower of London. This iconic structure has a long and fascinating history, starting way back in 1066. After William the Conqueror successfully invaded England, he needed to establish control and demonstrate his power. One of the key ways he did this was by building castles, and the Tower of London was one of the earliest and most important. Construction began shortly after the Norman Conquest. Initially, it was a wooden structure, but it was later rebuilt in stone, becoming the imposing White Tower that still stands today. So, while figures like Oliver Cromwell, Winston Churchill, and Queen Elizabeth II have all played significant roles in British history, they came along much later. The Tower of London's origins are firmly rooted in the Norman Conquest, making William the Conqueror the person who commissioned its construction as a symbol of Norman power and control over London.
