Okay, so National Insurance numbers are super important in the UK because they're how the government tracks your contributions to the social security system. Think of it like your personal account for things like state pension and benefits. The government wants to get everyone set up early so they can start contributing as soon as they begin working and paying taxes. That's why, in practice, almost all young people are automatically sent a National Insurance number shortly before they turn 16. It doesn't mean they *have* to start working then, but it ensures they're ready to go when they do. It's a proactive measure to streamline the system and make sure everyone is on the books from the get-go. While it's not *legally* mandated that everyone receives one right before their 16th birthday, it's the standard practice, making the statement effectively true in the context of the Life in the UK test.
