Eid ul Adha, also known as the "Festival of Sacrifice," is one of the most important holidays in the Islamic calendar. It marks the end of the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. The festival commemorates the story of the Prophet Ibrahim, who in the Christian Old Testament is known as Abraham. God commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice his son, and Ibrahim was willing to obey as an act of faith. However, at the last moment, God intervened and provided a lamb to be sacrificed instead. This story is seen as a demonstration of Ibrahim's unwavering devotion to God. During Eid ul Adha, Muslims often sacrifice an animal, usually a sheep, goat, or cow, to remember Ibrahim's sacrifice. The meat is then shared with family, friends, and those in need. So, the statement is true because the festival directly commemorates Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God.
