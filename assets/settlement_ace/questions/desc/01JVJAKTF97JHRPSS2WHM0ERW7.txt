The 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo were a huge moment for British sport, largely thanks to Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean. Their ice dance performance to Ravel's Boléro wasn't just a gold medal-winning routine; it was a cultural phenomenon. It captivated audiences worldwide with its artistry and innovation, earning them perfect scores and cementing their place in Olympic history. The other options simply don't fit the timeline or the sport. Bobby Moore was a famous footballer, and Dame Kelly Holmes an Olympic track and field champion. Peggy Fleming was an American figure skater who won gold in 1968, and Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir are Canadian ice dancers who achieved fame much later, in the 21st century. Torvill and Dean's Boléro remains one of the most iconic moments in Olympic history, making them the obvious and only correct answer.
