Scottish juries are unique within the UK legal system, primarily because of their size and verdict options. Unlike England and Wales, where juries consist of 12 people, Scotland uses a jury of 15. This difference stems from historical variations in legal practice. The larger jury size aims to ensure a broader representation of perspectives when deciding a case. Another key difference is that Scottish juries have three verdict options: guilty, not guilty, and not proven. The "not proven" verdict, while resulting in the accused's release, implies that the jury wasn't convinced of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt but also wasn't convinced of innocence. So, remembering that Scottish juries have 15 members helps distinguish it from the rest of the UK. The other numbers, 8, 11, and 20, are simply incorrect and don't reflect any aspect of jury composition in the UK.
