Saint Andrew's Day is a celebration of Scotland's patron saint, Saint Andrew. Now, Saint Andrew wasn't actually Scottish, but he's been linked to Scotland for a very long time. Legend has it that some of his relics were brought to Scotland way back in the 4th century, and he's been the country's patron saint since around the 10th century. He's also the patron saint of Greece, Russia, and Barbados, which is interesting! The key thing to remember for the test is the date: St Andrew's Day is celebrated annually on November 30th. It's a bank holiday in Scotland, and people often celebrate with traditional Scottish food, music, and dancing. So, the statement that St Andrew's Day is on March 17th is false. March 17th is actually St. Patrick's Day, the celebration of the patron saint of Ireland. It's easy to get the two mixed up if you're not careful!
