Okay, let's talk about Anglo-Saxon literature. When we think about the early history of England, the Anglo-Saxon period is crucial. It spans from roughly 410 AD, after the Romans left, to 1066 with the Norman Conquest. During this time, a distinct culture and language developed, and with it, a rich oral tradition of storytelling and poetry. *Beowulf* is the most famous example of this. It's an epic poem, originally passed down orally, that tells the story of a Geatish warrior who battles monsters and dragons. It gives us insights into the values of Anglo-Saxon society: courage, loyalty, and the importance of warrior culture. The other options, *Pride and Prejudice*, *Jude the Obscure*, and *Mr. Hyde*, are much later works of English literature. *Pride and Prejudice* is a Regency-era novel by Jane Austen, while *Jude the Obscure* is a Victorian novel by Thomas Hardy, and *Mr. Hyde* is also a Victorian novel by Robert Louis Stevenson. All three are separated from the Anglo-Saxon period by hundreds of years, and are written in a very different style of English. So, *Beowulf* is the only one that fits the bill as an Anglo-Saxon poem.
