Radar, which stands for Radio Detection and Ranging, was a pivotal technology developed in the lead-up to World War II. The need to detect approaching enemy aircraft was becoming increasingly urgent, and scientists were exploring ways to use radio waves for this purpose. While the concept of using radio waves to detect objects existed earlier, it was Sir Robert Watson-Watt who is credited with pioneering the practical development of radar technology in Britain. In the 1930s, he led a team that built the first operational radar system, which played a crucial role in the Battle of Britain. This system allowed the Royal Air Force to detect incoming German planes early, giving them a vital advantage. So, when you think about the person most associated with the initial development of radar, it's Sir Robert Watson-Watt. The other options are notable figures, but in entirely different fields: Patrick Steptoe was a pioneer of in-vitro fertilization, James Goodfellow invented the personal identification number (PIN), and Mary Peters is a celebrated athlete.
