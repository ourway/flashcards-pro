Dame Ellen MacArthur is the correct answer because she completed the fastest solo circumnavigation of the globe, single-handed, in 2005. This means she sailed around the world alone, without any assistance. This incredible feat took her just over 71 days, breaking the previous record. While Jessica Ennis-Hill, Ellie Simmonds, and Dame Kelly Holmes are all incredibly accomplished British athletes, their achievements lie in track and field and swimming. They are not known for sailing accomplishments. MacArthur's record-breaking voyage captured the public's imagination, highlighting her incredible skill, endurance, and bravery. It's a testament to the spirit of adventure and pushing the boundaries of human capability. The other athletes are famous for their achievements in different fields, which is why they are not the correct answer in this context.
