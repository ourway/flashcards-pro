The UK boasts a vibrant festival scene, but they're not all about the music. Think of Glastonbury, Creamfields, and the V Festival â€“ these are all massive, well-known music events drawing huge crowds and featuring famous bands and artists. Glastonbury, for example, started in 1970 and has grown into one of the world's largest music and performing arts festivals. Creamfields is synonymous with electronic dance music, and the V Festival, though it no longer runs, was a staple of the British summer music scene for many years. The Fringe, however, is a different beast altogether. While you might find music performances there, it's primarily an arts festival. Specifically, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival is the world's largest arts festival, showcasing theatre, comedy, dance, physical theatre, circus, cabaret, opera, music, spoken word, exhibitions and events. So, while the others are music-centric, The Fringe is a much broader celebration of the arts.
