The PDSA, or People's Dispensary for Sick Animals, is a veterinary charity in the UK that provides free and reduced-cost veterinary care to sick and injured animals belonging to people in need. Founded in 1917 by Maria Dickin, its original mission was to provide care for working animals during World War I. Dickin witnessed the suffering of animals in London's East End and was determined to provide them with veterinary care. The PDSA has a long and rich history of helping animals and their owners, and it operates numerous veterinary hospitals across the UK. The other options are charities, but they focus on different areas. The NSPCC is dedicated to protecting children, Crisis and Shelter work to combat homelessness, and Age UK supports older people. While all are worthy causes, only the PDSA is specifically focused on animal welfare.
