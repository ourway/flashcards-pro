Christmas Day, observed on December 25th, is a globally recognized holiday commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ. While the Bible doesn't specify an exact date for Jesus' birth, the Western Christian Church formally adopted December 25th in the 4th century. This date may have been chosen to coincide with existing pagan winter solstice festivals, making it easier to integrate new converts into Christianity. Over centuries, Christmas has evolved into a blend of religious observance and cultural traditions, including gift-giving, decorating Christmas trees, and festive meals. While Boxing Day on December 26th is also a holiday in the UK, it is related to giving gifts to the poor and service workers, not the actual celebration of Christ's birth. New Year's Day on January 1st marks the start of the Gregorian calendar year, and New Year's Eve on December 31st is a celebration of the coming year, neither of which are related to the Christian holiday of Christmas.
