During Queen Elizabeth I's reign in the late 16th century, England began seriously exploring and establishing colonies overseas, driven by factors like trade, resources, and competition with other European powers like Spain. While English explorers like Sir Francis Drake sailed around the world, the focus for actual settlement was on the eastern coast of North America. This area offered promising opportunities for establishing new trade routes and exploiting natural resources. The first, though unsuccessful, English colony was Roanoke, established in 1585. Although it failed, it paved the way for future attempts. The southern coast of Africa and the western coast of Asia were primarily areas of trade and exploration for the English at this time, not large-scale colonization. Australia wasn't even on the radar for English settlement until much later, in the 18th century. So, the eastern coast of North America is the correct answer because it was the primary region where the English focused their initial efforts to create permanent settlements during Elizabeth I's reign.
