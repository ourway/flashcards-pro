Okay, let's talk about tobacco and age restrictions in the UK. The law is very clear on this: it's illegal to sell tobacco products, including cigarettes and vaping products, to anyone under the age of 18. This law is in place to protect young people from the harmful effects of nicotine and to discourage them from starting a habit that can lead to serious health problems later in life, like lung cancer and heart disease. The age of 18 is considered the age of adulthood in the UK, and with that comes the legal responsibility to make informed decisions about things like tobacco use. While some might think that younger people should have the freedom to choose, the law prioritizes their health and well-being, recognizing the addictive nature of nicotine and the long-term consequences of tobacco use. So, if you're asked about the legality of selling tobacco to under-18s, remember that it's against the law.
