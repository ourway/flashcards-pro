The Canterbury Tales, written by Geoffrey Chaucer in the late 14th century, offers a vibrant snapshot of medieval English society. Imagine a group of pilgrims traveling together from London to Canterbury Cathedral, a significant religious site. To pass the time on this journey, they decide to tell each other stories. Chaucer's genius lies in capturing these tales, which range from humorous and bawdy to moral and religious, reflecting the diverse backgrounds and personalities of the pilgrims. The book isn't about battles or the daily life *in* Canterbury itself, nor is it focused on royal narratives. Instead, it's a collection of narratives *told by* a diverse group of people. The stories themselves, and the characters who tell them, are the heart of the work, offering insights into the social customs, beliefs, and values of the time. So, while Canterbury is the destination, the real journey is through the stories these pilgrims share.
