The Battle of Agincourt is a pivotal moment in English history, a real David-versus-Goliath story. It took place during the Hundred Years' War, a long and complex conflict between England and France for control of the French throne. Think of it as a really long, drawn-out family feud between royal houses. In 1415, King Henry V of England, leading a relatively small and weakened English army, faced a much larger French force on a muddy field in northern France. Despite being heavily outnumbered and facing terrible weather conditions, the English, thanks to their skilled longbowmen, achieved a stunning victory. The English longbow proved devastating against the heavily armored French knights, turning the tide of the battle. This victory significantly boosted English morale and temporarily strengthened their claim to the French throne. So, the Battle of Agincourt, a key event in the Hundred Years' War and a symbol of English military prowess, happened in 1415.
