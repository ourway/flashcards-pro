The British national anthem, "God Save the Queen" (or "God Save the King" when there's a male monarch), is more than just a song; it's a symbol of the nation, representing loyalty to the Crown and the United Kingdom. Its origins are a bit murky, but it gained popularity in the mid-18th century, particularly during the Jacobite rebellions as a patriotic rallying cry for the Hanoverian King George II. Think of it like a musical flag â€“ you wouldn't only raise the Union Jack when the monarch is physically present, would you? Similarly, "God Save the Queen" is played at various national events, sporting occasions (like football matches), and royal celebrations, regardless of whether the Queen or King is actually there. It's a general expression of national pride and allegiance, not a personal theme song only for royal appearances. While it's certainly played *for* the monarch, it's not exclusively reserved for their presence.
