Okay, let's talk about some famous faces from the UK! When we think about sports icons, Jackie Stewart and Sir Chris Hoy are definitely top contenders. Jackie Stewart is a Scottish former Formula One racing driver. He competed in Formula One between 1965 and 1973, winning three World Drivers' Championships. He was nicknamed the "Flying Scot" and is still a well-known figure in the racing world. Then there's Sir Chris Hoy, another Scottish sporting legend. He's a former track cyclist and one of Britain's most successful Olympians, with six gold medals and one silver. He dominated the velodrome for years, becoming a household name. Now, while William Shakespeare was a brilliant playwright and Thomas Gainsborough a renowned painter, they weren't exactly known for their athletic prowess! They were masters of the arts, not the sports arena. So, when you're asked about UK sports stars, remember the speed and skill of Jackie Stewart and Sir Chris Hoy.
