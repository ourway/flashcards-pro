England's economy during the Middle Ages, roughly from the 11th to the 15th centuries, was heavily reliant on agriculture, and one product stood out above all others: wool. The English climate was perfect for raising sheep, and the demand for wool across Europe was incredibly high, especially from textile centers in Flanders (modern-day Belgium). Think of the rolling hills dotted with sheep â€“ that image is central to understanding medieval England's wealth. Wool became England's primary export, driving its economy and even influencing its political landscape. The wool trade was so important that it was taxed heavily, providing significant revenue for the Crown. While stone was certainly used for building, and glass production existed on a smaller scale, neither rivaled wool's economic impact. Potatoes, of course, weren't even introduced to Europe until after the Columbian Exchange much later, making wool the only viable option.
