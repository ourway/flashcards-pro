Henry VIII is famous for having six wives, and their fates are often remembered with the rhyme "divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived." To understand Catherine Howard's place in this dramatic history, it's helpful to remember the order. First came Catherine of Aragon, then Anne Boleyn, followed by Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard, and finally, Catherine Parr. Catherine Howard was, in fact, the fifth wife, not the sixth. She was much younger than Henry, and their marriage was short-lived. Sadly, she was beheaded in 1542, only a couple of years after marrying the king, after accusations of treasonous behavior. So, while it's easy to get the Catherines mixed up, remembering the rhyme and the order of Henry's wives clarifies that Catherine Howard was indeed number five.
