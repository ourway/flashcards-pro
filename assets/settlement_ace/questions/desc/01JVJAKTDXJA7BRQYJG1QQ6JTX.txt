Okay, let's talk about the sheer size of Great Britain! It's easy to underestimate the distance from top to bottom. When we think about the UK, we often focus on England, but Scotland adds a significant stretch to the island. The northernmost point of Scotland is actually further north than parts of Scandinavia! Now, if you were to drive from the very tip-top of Scotland, say John o' Groats, all the way down to the southern coast of England, perhaps Land's End, you'd be covering a considerable distance. It's not a quick hop. The actual distance is approximately 870 miles. The other options are tempting because they seem like reasonable distances, but they fall short of capturing the full length of the island. Think of it this way: 270 or 470 miles would only get you partway through England, and 1070 is an overestimate. So, 870 miles is the closest and most accurate figure.
