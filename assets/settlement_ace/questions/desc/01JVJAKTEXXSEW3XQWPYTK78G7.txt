William Shakespeare, often called England's national poet, wrote around 39 plays, and many are incredibly famous and still performed today. But when we think of his most iconic and widely recognized work, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" often tops the list. This play, believed to have been written around 1595 or 1596, is a comedy filled with fairies, love potions, and mistaken identities, making it incredibly accessible and entertaining for audiences of all ages. Its themes of love, illusion, and the power of dreams resonate even now. While "Under Milk Wood" is a famous radio drama by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, "The Jungle Book" is a collection of stories by Rudyard Kipling, and "The Canterbury Tales" is a collection of stories written by Geoffrey Chaucer in the late 14th century, none of these are plays written by Shakespeare. "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is a play by Shakespeare that is considered his most famous.
