Okay, let's break down the role of the opposition party in the UK's political system. The UK operates under a parliamentary system, and a key feature of this system is the concept of a "government" and an "opposition." After a general election, the political party that wins the majority of seats in the House of Commons usually forms the government. Now, the party with the *second* largest number of seats becomes the official opposition. Their main job is to scrutinize the government's policies and actions, offering alternative viewpoints and holding the government accountable. They essentially form a "shadow government," with shadow ministers mirroring the roles of government ministers. This ensures there's a robust challenge to the government's agenda and provides voters with a clear alternative. So, because the opposition party is indeed the second-largest party in the House of Commons, ready to challenge the ruling party, the statement is true. It's a vital part of the democratic process, ensuring different voices are heard.
