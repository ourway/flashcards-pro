Okay, let's talk about those place names ending in "-by" and "-thorpe"! When you see those, you're looking at Viking influence. The Vikings, also known as Norsemen, began raiding and settling in Britain from the late 8th century onwards, with a major presence in the 9th and 10th centuries. They came from Scandinavia â€“ modern-day Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. Now, the key here is that "-by" means "village" or "town" in Old Norse, the language of the Vikings, and "-thorpe" means "farmstead" or "settlement." So, Grimsby literally means "Grim's village," and Scunthorpe is "Skuma's farmstead." The Saxons were earlier settlers, but their place names have different endings, like "-ton" or "-ham." The Normans came later, after the Vikings, and their influence is more evident in castles and legal terms. The Celts were in Britain long before any of these groups, but their language left a different mark, mainly in areas like Wales and Scotland. So, Viking place names are a clear indicator of where they established settlements in England, particularly in the north and east.
