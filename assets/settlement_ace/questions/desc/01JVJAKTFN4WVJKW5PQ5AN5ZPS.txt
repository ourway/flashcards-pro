Hansard is the official report of what is said in Parliament. Think of it as the official record or transcript of debates in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. It's been around in some form since the late 18th century, evolving from unofficial reports to the authoritative record we know today. Because it's the official record, it's considered a primary source for understanding parliamentary proceedings. Now, while you might not think of parliamentary records as prime-time entertainment, Hansard is actually broadcast on digital TV so people can follow debates and discussions happening in Parliament. It's a way to make the workings of government more transparent and accessible to the public. Parliamentary News, while it sounds plausible, isn't the official record; it's more likely to be a news outlet's interpretation of events. So, if you're looking for the official, verbatim account broadcast on TV, Hansard is the one to remember.
