The Huguenots were French Protestants who faced severe persecution in France, particularly during the 16th and 17th centuries. The Edict of Nantes in 1598 had granted them some religious freedom, but this was revoked in 1685 by Louis XIV with the Edict of Fontainebleau. This revocation led to a mass exodus of Huguenots from France. England, with its Protestant leanings, offered refuge to many of them. Large numbers of Huguenots arrived in England from the 1680s onwards, bringing with them valuable skills in trades like weaving, clockmaking, and silversmithing. Their arrival significantly boosted the English economy and enriched its culture. So, because this major Huguenot migration happened well before 1720, they are the correct answer. The Bretons are an ethnic group from Brittany in France, but their migrations to Britain happened much earlier, primarily during the Anglo-Saxon period. The Welsh are a native British group, not refugees who settled in England. While Germans have migrated to England at various points, a significant wave of German refugees came much later, particularly in the 20th century during the World Wars.
