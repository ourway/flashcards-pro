Royal Ascot is a cornerstone of the British social and sporting calendar, steeped in history and tradition. Horse racing has been popular in Britain for centuries, but Royal Ascot's origins trace back to 1711 when Queen Anne founded the Ascot Racecourse. The "Royal" in its name is no accident; the British Royal Family has maintained a close association with the event ever since. Each day of the five-day event begins with the Royal Procession, where the monarch and other members of the Royal Family arrive in horse-drawn carriages. While Wimbledon (tennis), The Open (golf), and the Six Nations (rugby) are all major sporting events held in the UK, none are specifically associated with horse racing or the Royal Family in the same way as Royal Ascot. The event is renowned not only for the high-quality racing but also for the elaborate hats and fashion worn by attendees, making it a unique blend of sport, style, and royal pageantry.
