The concept of the rule of law is absolutely fundamental to the UK's legal and political system. It essentially means that everyone, without exception, is subject to and accountable under the law. This principle has evolved over centuries, with key milestones like the Magna Carta in 1215, which limited the power of the monarch and established that even the king was subject to the law. The idea is that laws are applied consistently and fairly, regardless of a person's status, wealth, or beliefs. So, the notion that citizens or permanent residents could pick and choose which laws to obey completely undermines this core principle. Allowing selective obedience would lead to chaos and inequality, as some people would be above the law while others are not. That's why the answer is false; everyone in the UK is bound by the same laws.
