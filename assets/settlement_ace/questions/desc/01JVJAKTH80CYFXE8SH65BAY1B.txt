The poppy's association with Remembrance Day stems directly from the First World War. The vivid red flowers bloomed across some of the worst battlefields of the Western Front, particularly in Flanders, Belgium. Canadian physician Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae noticed this phenomenon and was inspired to write the famous poem "In Flanders Fields" in 1915, which vividly describes the poppies growing amidst the graves of fallen soldiers. This poem resonated deeply with people, and the poppy quickly became a powerful symbol of remembrance, sacrifice, and hope. After the war, the Royal British Legion adopted the poppy as its emblem, selling artificial poppies to raise money for veterans and their families. Wearing a poppy became a way to honour those who died in service and to support those who survived. While daffodils are associated with Wales and roses with England, and lilies are often used at funerals, none carry the specific historical weight and connection to wartime sacrifice that the poppy does.
