When someone owes you money and refuses to pay, you need a way to legally recover that debt. That's where the County Court comes in. The County Court system in England and Wales handles a wide range of civil disputes, and debt recovery is one of its primary functions. Think of it as the go-to place for resolving financial disagreements between individuals or businesses. You'd file a claim with the County Court, and they would then manage the process of notifying the debtor and, if necessary, arranging a court hearing to decide the matter. The Magistrates' Court primarily deals with criminal cases and some family matters, not debt recovery. The Youth Court handles cases involving young people who have committed crimes. And the Coroner's Court investigates deaths that are sudden, violent, or unexplained. So, while you might be tempted to think any court could handle a debt, the County Court is specifically designed for this type of civil claim.
