The National Assembly for Wales, now known as the Senedd, is the democratically elected body responsible for making laws and representing the interests of Wales. Think of it as the Welsh equivalent of the Scottish Parliament or the Northern Ireland Assembly, although with slightly different powers. It was established in 1999 following a referendum, marking a significant step in Welsh devolution, which is the transfer of power from the UK Parliament to Wales. Initially, the Assembly had limited law-making powers, but these have gradually increased over time. The key thing to remember for the test is the number of representatives, officially called Members of the Senedd, or MSs. There are exactly 60 MSs in the Senedd. So, while 50, 70, or 80 might sound plausible, the correct number is 60. A helpful way to remember this is the hint: Picture the National Assembly for Wales as a clock with a representative for every minute and you'll get the number right.
