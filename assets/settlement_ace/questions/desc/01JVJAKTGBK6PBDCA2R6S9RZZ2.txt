County Courts in the UK serve a vital function in resolving everyday legal disputes. To understand their role, it's helpful to think about the types of problems people commonly encounter. Breaches of contract, where one party fails to uphold their end of an agreement, are a frequent occurrence. This could be anything from a builder not completing work to a business failing to deliver goods. Similarly, divorce proceedings, involving the legal dissolution of a marriage and related issues like finances and child custody, are also handled in County Courts. These courts are designed to be accessible and efficient for dealing with these kinds of civil matters. On the other hand, more serious criminal offences like murder are dealt with in the Crown Court, which handles the most serious criminal cases. Minor criminal offences are usually handled in the Magistrates' Courts. So, while County Courts are important for resolving disputes, they don't typically deal with criminal matters.
