The idea of radar and jet engines being around in the 1830s is definitely a stretch! Think about what life was like back then. The 1830s were the era of the early Industrial Revolution, dominated by steam power. We're talking about the rise of railways and factories, but not yet the sophisticated technology needed for radar or jet propulsion. Radar, which uses radio waves to detect objects, really came into its own during World War II in the 1930s and 40s. Similarly, while there were earlier concepts, the first jet engine that actually worked was developed by Sir Frank Whittle in Britain in the late 1930s. So, while Britain was a hotbed of innovation, these specific inventions are much more recent than the 1830s. It's easy to get confused about the timeline of inventions, but remembering that these technologies were crucial for World War II helps place them firmly in the 20th century.
