St. David's Day, celebrated on March 1st, is all about honouring the patron saint of Wales, Saint David. He lived in the 6th century and was a key figure in spreading Christianity in Wales. The date itself, March 1st, is believed to be the day he died, around the year 589. So, the Welsh celebrate his life and legacy on this day each year. It's a day filled with Welsh pride, where people wear daffodils or leeks – both national symbols of Wales – and often children participate in school concerts or eisteddfods, which are festivals celebrating Welsh literature, music, and performance. While St. Patrick's Day on March 17th might be more widely known internationally, St. David's Day is hugely important within Wales, marking a significant part of their cultural identity and history.
