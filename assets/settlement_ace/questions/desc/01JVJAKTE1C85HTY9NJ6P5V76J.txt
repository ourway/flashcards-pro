The Tower of London has a long and fascinating history, stretching back nearly 1000 years to William the Conqueror. Originally built as a fortress to protect the Norman invaders, it has served many purposes over the centuries, including a royal palace, a prison, and even a zoo! But most famously, it's been the secure home of the Crown Jewels since the 17th century. These aren't just any old jewels; they are priceless symbols of the British monarchy, including crowns, orbs, sceptres, swords, and coronation robes. They represent the power and authority of the monarch. The Tower's strong walls and dedicated guards, known as Yeoman Warders or "Beefeaters," make it the perfect place to keep these treasures safe. While you might expect to find royal treasures at Buckingham Palace, that's actually the monarch's administrative headquarters and residence. The National Museum and Queen's House in Greenwich are wonderful places to visit, but they don't house the Crown Jewels. So, if you want to see the glittering symbols of British royalty, the Tower of London is the place to go.
