The late 19th century was a period of incredible technological advancement, and one of the most exciting inventions was the cinematograph, the early motion picture camera and projector. While the very first public film screening took place in Paris in 1895, it didn't take long for the phenomenon to cross the Channel. In 1896, films were first publicly exhibited in the UK, marking the beginning of cinema's long and influential history in the country. This was a pivotal moment, as it introduced the British public to a brand-new form of entertainment and storytelling. The other dates are incorrect because they either predate the invention of cinema altogether (1846) or come after the initial introduction of film to the UK (1916 and 1946). So, remember 1896 as the year the magic of moving pictures first captivated audiences in Britain.
