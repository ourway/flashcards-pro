Devolved governments in the UK have far more power than simply advising or encouraging. Devolution, which started in the late 1990s, involved transferring specific powers from the UK Parliament in Westminster to the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly (now Senedd), and the Northern Ireland Assembly. This means these devolved bodies can actually create their own laws, known as legislation, on a range of issues. Think about it: Scotland has different laws on things like education, healthcare, and even some aspects of criminal justice compared to England. Wales has control over areas like health, education, and economic development. Northern Ireland has powers over policing, justice, and agriculture. So, the idea that they only advise is completely wrong. They actively legislate and make legally binding decisions within their devolved areas. It's easy to see why someone might think they only advise, as the UK Parliament still holds some reserved powers, but the devolved governments are much more than advisory bodies.
