Oliver Cromwell's story is a fascinating part of British and Irish history, especially when it comes to understanding the monarchy. After the English Civil War in the mid-17th century, which saw the execution of King Charles I in 1649, the monarchy was abolished. Cromwell became a key figure, leading the Parliamentarian forces. Instead of becoming king himself, he took on the title of 'Lord Protector' in 1653, leading what was essentially a republic known as the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland. While he held immense power and his rule was certainly authoritarian at times, he deliberately avoided the title of 'King'. This was partly due to opposition within Parliament and the army, who were wary of establishing another monarchy. So, even though Cromwell exerted significant control over Ireland, he never assumed the title 'King of Ireland' or any royal title for that matter. It's a common misconception to think he might have, given his power, but his official position was always 'Lord Protector'.
