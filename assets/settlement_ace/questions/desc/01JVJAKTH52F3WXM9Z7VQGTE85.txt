Okay, let's talk about the Battle of Hastings. This battle, fought in 1066, is one of the most significant events in English history. Think of it as a turning point. Before 1066, England was ruled by Anglo-Saxon kings. Edward the Confessor died without a clear heir, leading to a power struggle. William, Duke of Normandy, believed he had a claim to the English throne. So, he crossed the English Channel with his army and met the English forces, led by King Harold, at Hastings. William's victory at the Battle of Hastings was decisive. Harold was killed, and the Norman army was able to take control of England. This led to huge changes in English society, language, law, and culture. The other battles listed – Agincourt, Bannockburn, and Bosworth Field – were important battles in British history, but they happened much later and involved different conflicts and players. Agincourt was during the Hundred Years' War, Bannockburn was a Scottish victory against the English, and Bosworth Field ended the Wars of the Roses. So, Hastings is the one directly linked to William the Conqueror and the Norman Conquest.
