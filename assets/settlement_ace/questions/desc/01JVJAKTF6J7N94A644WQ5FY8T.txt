Hadrian's Wall is one of the most iconic Roman structures in Britain, and its purpose and origin are key to understanding Roman Britain. The Roman Emperor Hadrian ordered its construction around AD 122. Hadrian visited Britain and decided to build a physical barrier to mark the northern limit of the Roman Empire and to control movement in and out of the province. It wasn't just about defense; it also served as a customs point. The wall stretched approximately 80 miles across the width of northern England, from the east coast to the west. It's named after Hadrian, so that's a big clue! While the Picts, who lived north of the wall in what is now Scotland, were frequent adversaries of the Romans, they certainly didn't build the wall to keep the Romans out. The wall was a Roman project, designed to manage their territory and interactions with the tribes beyond their control.
