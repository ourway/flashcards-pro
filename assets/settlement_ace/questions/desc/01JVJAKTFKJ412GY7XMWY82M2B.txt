The Union Flag, often called the Union Jack, is a powerful symbol representing the United Kingdom, but its design has specific origins. It's a combination of three flags: the flag of England, which is the St. George's Cross (a red cross on a white background); the flag of Scotland, the St. Andrew's Cross (a white diagonal cross on a blue background); and the St. Patrick's Cross, representing Northern Ireland (a red diagonal cross on a white background). These were combined over time as the countries united. England and Scotland were united under one crown in 1603, and the first version of the Union Flag was created shortly after. Ireland was formally united with Great Britain in 1801, leading to the flag we know today. Wales, however, was already part of the Kingdom of England when the first Union Flag was designed. Therefore, the Welsh dragon or any other Welsh symbol isn't included in the Union Flag's design, making Wales the correct answer. It's a common misconception to think the flag represents all parts of the UK equally, but its historical development explains why Wales is the exception.
