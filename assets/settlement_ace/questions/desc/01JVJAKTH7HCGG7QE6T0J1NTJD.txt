Okay, let's explore the castles that are still in use today. Castles in the UK aren't just relics of the past; some continue to serve important functions. Think about the monarchy. While Buckingham Palace is the administrative headquarters, Windsor Castle is a key royal residence. It's the oldest and largest occupied castle in the world, with a history stretching back to William the Conqueror in the 11th century. It's used for state occasions, royal weddings, and is a regular home for the monarch. Then we have Edinburgh Castle, a powerful symbol of Scotland. Perched atop Castle Rock, it dominates the Edinburgh skyline and has played a vital role in Scottish history since at least the 12th century. While it's a major tourist attraction, it also houses military garrisons and is used for ceremonial purposes. So, Windsor and Edinburgh are the two that are still very much "operational" in the 21st century. Aberdeen, London, and Dublin all have significant castles, but they are primarily historical sites or museums now, not actively used as residences or for state functions.
