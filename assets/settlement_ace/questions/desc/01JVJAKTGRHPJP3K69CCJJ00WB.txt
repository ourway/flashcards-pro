The abolition of slavery in the British Empire was a gradual process, not a single event. The transatlantic slave trade, which transported enslaved Africans to the Americas, was outlawed in 1807. However, owning enslaved people remained legal. The movement to completely abolish slavery gained momentum in the early 19th century, driven by religious groups, abolitionist societies, and growing public awareness of the brutal conditions endured by enslaved people. The Emancipation Act of 1833 finally outlawed slavery in most parts of the British Empire, although it included a controversial apprenticeship system that kept formerly enslaved people bound to their former owners for a period of years. While some might think of earlier dates related to the slave trade, it's important to remember that 1833 is the key year for the complete abolition of slavery itself.
