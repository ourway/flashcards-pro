Okay, let's talk about the legal age for buying tobacco in the UK. The key thing to remember here is that the age limit is set at 18. This wasn't always the case; the age used to be lower, but it was raised to 18 in October 2007. The reason behind this change was primarily to protect young people's health. Public health research consistently shows that the earlier someone starts smoking, the more likely they are to become addicted and suffer from smoking-related diseases later in life. By raising the age, the government aimed to reduce the number of young people taking up smoking and improve overall public health. You might think 16 or 17 could be the answer, perhaps confusing it with other legal milestones like driving a moped, but the purchase of tobacco is specifically restricted until you reach full adulthood at 18. It's also worth noting that this age aligns with other significant legal responsibilities, such as voting and entering into contracts, marking a clear point of adulthood.
