Okay, let's break down the UK's membership in international organizations. After World War II, many nations sought ways to cooperate and prevent future conflicts. Two major organizations emerged that the UK is a key part of. First, there's NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This is a military alliance formed in 1949, primarily to counter the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The UK was a founding member and remains a vital part of NATO's defense strategy. Then there's the Commonwealth, which is a unique organization. It evolved from the British Empire and is now a voluntary association of 56 independent countries, most of which have historical links to the UK. It promotes cooperation in areas like trade, democracy, and development. So, the UK's membership in both NATO, for defense, and the Commonwealth, for historical and cooperative ties, makes that the right answer. NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, is a trade agreement between the US, Canada, and Mexico, so the UK wouldn't be a part of that. And the Arab League, as the name suggests, is focused on Arab states.
