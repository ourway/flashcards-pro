Okay, let's break down why George of Hanover becoming King after Queen Anne's death is indeed true. Think back to the early 18th century. Queen Anne, the last of the Stuart monarchs, reigned until 1714. Now, she had no surviving children to take the throne. This created a succession crisis! Parliament, keen to avoid a Catholic monarch, had already passed the Act of Settlement in 1701. This act essentially said that the crown would go to the Protestant House of Hanover if Anne died without an heir. So, when Anne passed away, George of Hanover, her second cousin, became King George I. He wasn't even fluent in English! This marked a significant shift, establishing the Hanoverian dynasty and shaping British politics for generations. It's a fascinating period because it highlights how religious and political considerations heavily influenced who became the monarch.
