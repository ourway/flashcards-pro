In British politics, it's rare for one party to win an outright majority in Parliament, meaning they need support from other parties to govern effectively. After the 2010 general election, no single party had enough seats to form a government on its own. The Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, won the most seats but not enough for a majority. To form a stable government, they negotiated with the Liberal Democrats, led by Nick Clegg. The Liberal Democrats held the balance of power, and after some intense negotiations, they agreed to form a coalition government with the Conservatives. This was a significant moment because it was the first coalition government in the UK since World War II. The Labour Party, while a major political force, did not have enough seats to form a coalition with either of the other two parties. The Green Party, while gaining prominence, was not a major player in Parliament at that time. So, the correct answer is the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats Party because they were the two parties that came together to form that historic coalition government in 2010.
