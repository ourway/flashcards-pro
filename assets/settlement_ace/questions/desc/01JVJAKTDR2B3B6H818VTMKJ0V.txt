April Fools' Day, celebrated on the 1st of April, is a day for lighthearted fun involving pranks and hoaxes. Its origins are a bit murky, but one popular theory links it to the shift from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century. France adopted the new calendar in 1582, moving the start of the year from the end of March to January 1st. Some people either didn't get the memo, or stubbornly refused to change, and continued to celebrate New Year's at the end of March. These folks were mocked as "April Fools." While other dates in April might seem plausible, the tradition is firmly rooted on the first day of the month, making it the only correct answer. It's a day for jokes and good-natured trickery, a tradition that has spread worldwide.
