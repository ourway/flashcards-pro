Irish Gaelic, often simply called Irish, has deep roots in the island of Ireland, predating both English and even the arrival of the Celts. While English is widely spoken in Northern Ireland, Irish Gaelic holds a significant cultural and historical presence there. It's recognized as a minority language and protected under various agreements. You'll find Irish Gaelic taught in schools, used in some media outlets, and spoken within certain communities, particularly in areas like West Belfast and County Armagh. The language represents a connection to Ireland's ancient heritage and continues to be a living part of Northern Ireland's cultural landscape. So, while English dominates, the presence and active use of Irish Gaelic make the statement true. It's easy to think of the UK as solely English-speaking, but recognizing the linguistic diversity is key.
