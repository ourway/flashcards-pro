Okay, here's an explanation of why the Opposition in the House of Commons is indeed always the second-largest party. Think of the UK's parliamentary system as a two-team game, although sometimes there are more than two significant players. The party with the most Members of Parliament (MPs) elected in a general election usually forms the government. Now, the party with the *second* most MPs automatically becomes the official Opposition. This isn't just a matter of tradition; it's a crucial part of how the UK government is held accountable. The Opposition's main job is to scrutinize the government's policies and actions, propose alternative policies, and essentially be ready to step in and govern if the current government loses support. So, while other smaller parties might have some influence, the official Opposition, by definition, is always the second-largest, providing a clear alternative voice and ensuring a robust debate in Parliament. It's a key element of the UK's democratic process.
