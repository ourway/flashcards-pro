Rugby, a sport known for its physicality and strategic gameplay, has two major events that are central to its identity. The Six Nations Championship is an annual international tournament involving England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, and Wales. It's a showcase of national pride and intense rivalries, dating back to the late 19th century in various forms before solidifying into the Six Nations we know today. The Super League, on the other hand, is a professional rugby league competition featuring clubs primarily from England, with some participation from other European countries. It represents the pinnacle of club rugby league in the Northern Hemisphere. While the Premier League is associated with football (soccer) and Wimbledon is a world-famous tennis tournament, these have no connection to rugby. So, the Six Nations and the Super League are the two events that are deeply intertwined with the sport of rugby, representing both international and club-level excellence.
