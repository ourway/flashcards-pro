Okay, let's talk about the Hindu population in the UK. Hinduism, as a religion, has a significant presence in the UK due to immigration, primarily from India and East Africa, starting in the mid-20th century. While it's a vibrant and growing community, it's important to understand its proportion relative to the overall UK population. The 2009 Citizenship Survey aimed to capture a snapshot of the diverse religious identities within the UK at that time. Now, while Hinduism is visible and active, it doesn't represent a large percentage of the total population. The survey indicated that around 2% of the population identified as Hindu. This is a smaller proportion compared to other religions like Christianity or Islam, which have longer histories and larger established communities in the UK. So, while 4%, 6%, or 10% might seem plausible at first glance, they significantly overestimate the actual proportion of Hindus in the UK as recorded in that specific survey. Remember, these surveys provide valuable data for understanding the changing demographics and religious landscape of the UK.
