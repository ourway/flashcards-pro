The kingdoms of England and Scotland officially united in 1707, creating the single kingdom of Great Britain. This wasn't just a name change; it was a significant political event formalized by the Acts of Union. Think of it as a merger between two companies. Before 1707, England and Scotland shared a monarch since 1603, when James VI of Scotland became James I of England. However, they still had separate parliaments and legal systems. The Acts of Union dissolved both the English and Scottish Parliaments, creating a new Parliament of Great Britain at Westminster. This union was driven by a complex mix of factors, including economic benefits, political stability, and the desire to secure a Protestant succession to the throne. So, when you see the question about the union of England and Scotland, remember 1707 and the creation of Great Britain â€“ a pivotal moment that shaped the UK we know today.
