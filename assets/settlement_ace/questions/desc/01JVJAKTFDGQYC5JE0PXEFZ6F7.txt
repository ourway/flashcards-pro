The movement for Irish independence has a long and complex history, marked by various groups advocating for different levels of self-governance. While many Irish people naturally desired greater control over their own affairs, the term "People of Ireland" is far too broad to describe a specific political movement. The Roundheads and Cavaliers, on the other hand, were figures from the English Civil War in the 17th century, having nothing to do with Irish nationalism. The Fenians, however, were a specific group in the 19th century who sought complete separation from the United Kingdom. The Fenian Brotherhood, founded in America, and the Irish Republican Brotherhood, founded in Ireland, were sister organizations dedicated to achieving Irish independence through armed rebellion if necessary. They represented a more radical and militant approach compared to other nationalist movements at the time, making "Fenians" the correct term for those advocating full autonomy.
