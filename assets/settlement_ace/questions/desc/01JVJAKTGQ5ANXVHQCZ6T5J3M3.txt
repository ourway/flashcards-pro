King Charles I, who reigned in the 17th century, believed strongly in the divine right of kings and wanted religious uniformity throughout his realms. When he tried to impose a new Prayer Book on the Presbyterian Church of Scotland in 1637, it was seen as an attempt to force Anglican practices on them. This sparked widespread outrage in Scotland. The Scots formed an army to defend their religious freedom and, in 1640, they actually invaded England. This was a pivotal moment leading to the English Civil War. King Charles I, facing this Scottish invasion and lacking funds to raise his own army, was forced to recall Parliament, which he had previously dismissed. He hoped Parliament would grant him the money needed to fight the Scots. So, the two main outcomes were the formation of a Scottish army that invaded England, and King Charles I summoning Parliament to ask for funds. The other options are incorrect because Charles I didn't initially organize his own army without Parliament, and Parliament certainly didn't grant him money before the invasion. The invasion was the catalyst that forced his hand.
