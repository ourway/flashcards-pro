Margaret Thatcher, often referred to as the "Iron Lady," held the office of Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990, a total of 11 years. This makes her the longest-serving British Prime Minister of the 20th century. Her tenure was marked by significant economic and social reforms, including privatization of state-owned industries and curbing the power of trade unions. While these policies were controversial, they undeniably shaped modern Britain. Tony Blair, who served from 1997 to 2007, also had a significant run, but it fell just short of Thatcher's. John Major, who succeeded Thatcher, had a shorter term. So, while Blair and Major were important figures, Thatcher's 11 years in power set her apart in terms of longevity during that century.
