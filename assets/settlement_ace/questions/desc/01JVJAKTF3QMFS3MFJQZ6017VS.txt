Okay, so you want to know about the official written record of what goes on in Parliament. That record is called Hansard. The name comes from Thomas Curson Hansard, a printer who began publishing reports of parliamentary debates in the early 19th century. Before Hansard, reporting on parliamentary proceedings was often patchy and unofficial. Hansard's reports aimed to be a more comprehensive and accurate record. Over time, these reports became the official record of what is said and done in Parliament. It's a really important resource for anyone wanting to know what was discussed, what decisions were made, and the reasons behind them. So, while "Westminster's Herald" sounds like it could be a formal title, and the Cenotaph is a war memorial, Hansard is the specific name for the official, written record of parliamentary proceedings. The slight misspelling of "Gansard" is just there to trick you!
