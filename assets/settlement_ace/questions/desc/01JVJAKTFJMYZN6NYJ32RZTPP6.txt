Charlie Chaplin, a giant of early cinema, created a character that became universally recognizable: "The Tramp." This character, with his signature toothbrush moustache, bowler hat, and cane, first appeared in 1914 and quickly captured hearts worldwide. The Tramp was always down on his luck, often facing poverty and misfortune, but he maintained a dignified optimism and a resilient spirit. He was a symbol of the common man struggling against adversity, which resonated deeply with audiences, especially during times of economic hardship. While Chaplin played other roles, it's The Tramp that cemented his legacy. The other options just don't fit with Chaplin's style or the historical context of his work. Superheroes and scientific geniuses weren't common character types in early 20th-century silent films, and while bandits existed, they weren't the kind of sympathetic, comedic figure Chaplin perfected.
