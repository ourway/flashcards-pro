The Treaty of Rome is a pivotal moment in European history, marking the beginning of what we know today as the European Union. Think of post-World War II Europe: countries were trying to rebuild and prevent future conflicts. One key idea was to create economic interdependence, making war less likely. The Treaty of Rome, signed on 25 March 1957, established the European Economic Community, or EEC. This wasn't just a trade agreement; it aimed for a common market where goods, services, people, and capital could move freely. Six countries initially signed up: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany. The EEC proved successful, leading to further integration and eventually evolving into the European Union we know today. So, while other dates might sound plausible, it's 1957 that's etched in history as the year Europe took a major step towards closer unity with the Treaty of Rome.
