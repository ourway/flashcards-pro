The story of Boudicca is a powerful one from the early days of Roman Britain. The Romans began their conquest of Britain in AD 43, and initially, some British tribes, including the Iceni in what is now Norfolk, were allowed to rule as allies. However, when Prasutagus, the Iceni king, died, the Romans ignored his will, seized his lands, and treated his family brutally. This sparked a fierce rebellion led by his wife, Boudicca, around AD 60-61. Boudicca's forces initially achieved great success, destroying Colchester (then the Roman capital of Britain), London, and Verulamium (modern-day St Albans). These cities were all located in the southeast and east of England. The Iceni tribe inhabited the area we now know as Eastern England, specifically Norfolk and parts of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. So, when you think of Boudicca and her rebellion, remember that her kingdom and the sites of her victories were concentrated in Eastern England, making that the correct answer. While the Romans controlled much of Britain, Boudicca's uprising was specifically rooted in and targeted the Roman presence in the east.
