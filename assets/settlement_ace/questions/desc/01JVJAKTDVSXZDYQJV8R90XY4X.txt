Okay, let's talk about National Parks in the UK. These aren't just pretty places; they're legally protected areas chosen for their beautiful landscapes, wildlife, and cultural heritage. The idea of National Parks came from the United States in the late 19th century, but the UK established its first ones after World War II. This was partly to help people reconnect with nature after the war and to protect these special areas from development. Now, while England, Scotland, and Wales all have their own National Parks, Northern Ireland doesn't currently have any designated as such, though they do have Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. So, when we talk about the total number of National Parks across the *entire* UK, we're looking at 15. It's easy to get confused because England has 10, Wales has 3, and Scotland has 2. Some people might think of only the most famous ones, like the Lake District or Snowdonia, and underestimate the total. But remember, 15 is the correct number when you count them all up across the UK.
