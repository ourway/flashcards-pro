Okay, let's break down why the UK is indeed a constitutional monarchy. Think back to British history – the monarchy used to hold absolute power. Over centuries, through events like the Magna Carta in 1215 and the Glorious Revolution in 1688, power gradually shifted from the monarch to Parliament. These were pivotal moments that limited the monarch's authority and established the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Today, the King or Queen reigns, but they don't rule. Their functions are largely ceremonial, such as opening Parliament, approving legislation, and representing the UK on the world stage. Real political power rests with the elected government and Parliament. The "constitution" isn't a single written document like in the United States, but rather a collection of laws, conventions, and judicial precedents that define how the country is governed. So, while the UK has a monarch, their power is defined and limited by these constitutional principles, making it a constitutional monarchy. It's a blend of tradition and modern democracy. Some might think it's false because the monarch is still there, but that's precisely why it's *constitutional* – the monarchy exists within a framework of laws.
