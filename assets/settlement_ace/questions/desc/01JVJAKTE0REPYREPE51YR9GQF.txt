The Hundred Years War, despite its name, wasn't actually a century-long conflict. It stretched on for a significantly longer period, 116 years, specifically from 1337 to 1453. The name is a bit misleading, isn't it? This protracted struggle was primarily between England and France, involving a series of conflicts fueled by disputes over territory and the French throne. England, at the time, controlled significant portions of France, and the French kings were determined to reclaim their land. Think of figures like Edward III and Henry V on the English side, and Joan of Arc on the French side â€“ she became a national heroine for her role in turning the tide for France. While it wasn't a continuous war, there were periods of intense fighting interspersed with truces and periods of relative peace. So, while "Hundred Years War" is the popular name, remembering it actually lasted 116 years is key for the test.
