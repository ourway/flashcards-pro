Big Ben, officially known as the Great Bell, is a massive bell housed within the Elizabeth Tower at the Palace of Westminster in London. Construction of the tower began in 1843, but it wasn't until 1858 that the bell was finally cast and installed. The first attempt to cast the bell failed, resulting in a crack, so a second casting was necessary. Big Ben first chimed on July 11, 1859. So, if we do the math, from 1859 to the present day, it's been well over 150 years. While the other options might sound plausible, they're incorrect because they overestimate the bell's age. It's a common mistake to think of Big Ben as being much older, perhaps because it's such an iconic symbol of British history. But the bell's actual history only goes back to the mid-19th century.
