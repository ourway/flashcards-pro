National Insurance is a fundamental part of the UK's social security system, established in 1911 to provide benefits like unemployment pay and pensions. Think of it as a collective pot of money that everyone contributes to, which then supports those in need. Now, when it comes to paying National Insurance, the responsibility falls on both the employee and the employer. As an employee, you don't have to worry about calculating and sending off your contributions yourself. Instead, your employer deducts the correct amount directly from your wages before you even receive your paycheck. They then forward this money, along with their own employer contributions, to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). This system ensures that National Insurance contributions are collected efficiently and accurately, without placing the burden of direct payment on individual employees. So, while you are contributing, it's all handled seamlessly behind the scenes by your employer.
