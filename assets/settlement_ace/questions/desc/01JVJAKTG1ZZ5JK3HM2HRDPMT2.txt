Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is a hugely important celebration for Hindus, Sikhs, and Jains. It symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. The festival is associated with Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and many people pray for a successful year ahead. While the specific rituals and traditions can vary regionally, the core celebration generally lasts for five days. Each day has its own significance and set of practices. The first day focuses on preparation and cleaning, the second on decorations, the third is the main day for prayers and feasts, the fourth celebrates the bond between husband and wife, and the fifth day honors siblings. So, the answer is five days because that's the traditional duration encompassing all the key aspects of this vibrant and meaningful festival. It's easy to get mixed up with other festivals that have different lengths, but Diwali's core celebration is firmly rooted in this five-day structure.
