Forced marriage is a serious human rights violation, and the UK has specific laws in place to protect individuals from it. The key to understanding this question lies in recognizing that forced marriage isn't just about age or identity; it's about coercion and lack of consent. While age verification might seem relevant, it doesn't address the core issue of someone being forced into a marriage against their will. Similarly, a priest verifying identities doesn't tackle the problem of coercion. The most effective legal measure is obtaining court orders. These orders, such as Forced Marriage Protection Orders, can be sought by the potential victim or someone acting on their behalf. These orders can prevent the marriage from taking place or provide protection if the marriage has already occurred. They might include restrictions on travel or communication, ensuring the individual's safety and freedom to choose. This legal framework acknowledges the severity of forced marriage and provides a direct means of intervention and protection.
