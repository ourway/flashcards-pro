The Channel Islands, located off the coast of France, have a unique constitutional relationship with the UK. They aren't part of the UK, nor are they part of the European Union. Instead, they are self-governing dependencies of the Crown. This means they have their own directly elected legislative assemblies, systems of law, and courts of law. The UK government is responsible for their defence and international relations, but the Islands manage all their domestic affairs, including taxation. This autonomy dates back centuries, with roots in the Duchy of Normandy. William the Conqueror, who later became King of England in 1066, was also the Duke of Normandy, and the Channel Islands were part of that Duchy. While England and Normandy eventually separated, the Channel Islands remained loyal to the English Crown. So, the correct answer is yes, the Channel Islands are self-governing because they independently manage their internal affairs, a tradition that stretches back nearly a thousand years.
