Turkey is the traditional centerpiece of a British Christmas dinner, and its popularity stems from a fascinating blend of history and practicality. While goose was a common festive bird in earlier centuries, turkey gradually gained prominence, especially during the Victorian era. This was partly due to its increasing affordability and availability as farming practices improved. Queen Victoria herself was known to enjoy turkey at Christmas, further cementing its place in the national tradition. Unlike chicken, which is considered more of an everyday meal, turkey is large enough to feed a big family gathering, making it perfect for the festive season. Lamb and beef, while popular meats in the UK, are more commonly associated with other occasions like Easter or Sunday roasts. So, when you picture a classic British Christmas dinner, it's that majestic turkey taking center stage.
