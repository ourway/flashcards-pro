The Cenotaph, a prominent war memorial in London, stands as a powerful symbol of remembrance and sacrifice. Its name, derived from Greek, literally means "empty tomb," signifying that it honors those whose bodies were never recovered or identified. Originally a temporary structure erected in 1919 to mark the first anniversary of the Armistice that ended World War I, its popularity led to the construction of a permanent stone version in 1920. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, it's a simple yet striking monument, devoid of any religious symbols, making it inclusive to all faiths. The Cenotaph is the focal point of the annual National Service of Remembrance held on Remembrance Sunday, where the Queen and other dignitaries lay wreaths to commemorate the fallen. So, while you might see it in a public space, and it's certainly not a government office, its primary and enduring association is undeniably as a war memorial, a place to remember and honor those who served in conflicts.
