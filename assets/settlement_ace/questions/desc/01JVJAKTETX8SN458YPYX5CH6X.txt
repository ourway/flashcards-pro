Okay, let's break down why 1789 is the year that links revolution in France to war with Britain. The late 18th century was a time of huge upheaval in Europe, and the French Revolution is a pivotal event. Think about it: the French monarchy, which had been in power for centuries, was overthrown. This wasn't just a change of government; it was a radical shift in ideas about power, rights, and the role of the people. Now, Britain, at the time, was ruled by a monarchy and aristocracy, and they viewed the French Revolution with alarm. The revolutionary ideas threatened the established order across Europe. Initially, Britain tried to stay out of the conflict, but the execution of the French King Louis XVI in 1793 and France's expansionist policies made war inevitable. So, while the revolution itself started in 1789, the subsequent events directly led to war between Britain and France, a conflict that would dominate European politics for the next two decades. The other dates are simply not relevant to this major turning point in European history.
