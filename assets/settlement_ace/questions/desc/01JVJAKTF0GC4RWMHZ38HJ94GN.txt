The story of Britain and the European Union is a long and complex one. The seeds were sown after World War II with the idea of closer European cooperation to prevent future conflicts. Several countries formed the European Economic Community, or EEC, in 1957, but Britain initially stayed out. There was some hesitation and debate within the UK about whether joining was the right move. However, by the early 1970s, the government decided to pursue membership. After some negotiations, Britain finally joined the EEC on January 1st, 1973. It's interesting to note that a referendum was held in 1975 to confirm the public's support for staying in the EEC, and the majority voted in favour. So, while 1975 was a significant year for confirming membership, the actual year Britain became a member was indeed 1973. The years 1971 and 1976 are simply incorrect in this context.
