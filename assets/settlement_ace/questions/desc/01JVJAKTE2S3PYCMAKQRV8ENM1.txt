Okay, let's talk about UK landmarks. When we think of the UK, it's easy to get caught up in the cities, but the natural landscapes are just as iconic! Snowdonia, located in Wales, is a mountainous region and a National Park. It's home to Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales, attracting hikers and nature lovers from all over. Loch Lomond, on the other hand, is a stunning freshwater loch in Scotland, part of the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park. It's the largest surface area of freshwater in Great Britain and is known for its beautiful scenery, islands, and watersports. These two locations really represent the diverse natural beauty of the UK. The Grand Canyon is in the USA, and Notre Dame is in Paris, France, so they are definitely not UK landmarks, even though they are famous in their own right!
