The Victoria Cross, Britain's highest award for bravery in the face of the enemy, has a fascinating history tied directly to the Crimean War. Before this conflict, which lasted from 1854 to 1856, medals were primarily awarded to high-ranking officers. There wasn't a dedicated medal for ordinary soldiers displaying exceptional courage. Queen Victoria recognized this gap and wanted a way to honor the bravery of all ranks. So, she instituted the Victoria Cross in 1856 specifically to recognize acts of valor during the Crimean War. It was designed to be a medal that anyone, regardless of social standing, could earn through extraordinary courage. While other wars, like the Hundred Years War, predated the VC, and the World Wars saw its widespread use, it was the Crimean War that spurred its creation. Think of it this way: the Crimean War highlighted the need for such an award, leading to its establishment.
