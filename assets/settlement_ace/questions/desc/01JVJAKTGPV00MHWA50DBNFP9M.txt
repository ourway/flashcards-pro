Youth Courts deal with cases involving young people under the age of 18 who have been accused of committing a crime. The key principle behind these courts is to protect the privacy and well-being of the young person involved. Think of it less like a traditional courtroom drama and more like a private family matter that needs to be resolved. Because of this focus on protecting the child, the public isn't generally allowed to attend Youth Court hearings. Allowing the public in could lead to the young person being identified and potentially stigmatized, which goes against the court's aim of rehabilitation. While the adult court system is generally open to the public to ensure transparency, Youth Courts prioritize the welfare of the young person above all else. So, even though you might think all court proceedings are open to the public, Youth Courts are a specific exception to that rule.
