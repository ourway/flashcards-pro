The fight for women's suffrage in the UK was a long and hard-won battle. While many associate women getting the vote with the early 20th century, it actually happened in stages. The Representation of the People Act in 1918 was a huge step, granting women over 30 who met certain property qualifications the right to vote. Then, in 1928, the voting age for women was lowered to 21, matching the age for men. However, it wasn't until the late 1960s, a period of significant social and cultural change, that the voting age was lowered for everyone. The Representation of the People Act of 1969 lowered the voting age to 18 for both men and women. So, while 1918 and 1928 are important milestones in women's suffrage, they don't represent the year women gained the right to vote at 18. The correct answer is 1969, marking the year when all adults, regardless of gender, could vote at the age of 18.
