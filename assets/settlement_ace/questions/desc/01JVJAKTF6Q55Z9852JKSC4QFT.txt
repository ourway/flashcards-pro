Christmas Day, celebrated annually on December 25th, is the day Christians commemorate the birth of Jesus Christ. The story goes that Jesus was born to Mary in Bethlehem, and the day is a cornerstone of the Christian faith. While the exact date of Jesus' birth isn't historically confirmed, the 25th of December was chosen centuries ago to align with existing winter solstice festivals, making the Christian celebration more accessible and widely accepted. Over time, Christmas has evolved into a cultural holiday celebrated by many, regardless of their religious beliefs, with traditions like decorating Christmas trees, exchanging gifts, and enjoying festive meals. So, while Father's Day is about celebrating fathers, New Year marks the start of a new calendar year, and Boxing Day is a post-Christmas holiday with its own unique history, Christmas Day is specifically and universally associated with the celebration of Jesus' birth.
