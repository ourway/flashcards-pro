Boxing Day, observed on December 26th, has its roots in a few different traditions. One theory suggests it originated in the Victorian era when wealthy landowners would box up gifts and leftover food to give to their servants and employees the day after Christmas. Another idea is that churches would open their alms boxes, collecting money for the poor, on this day. Regardless of the exact origin, Boxing Day evolved into a day for giving to those less fortunate and for service workers to receive recognition. Today, it's a public holiday across the UK, meaning most people have the day off work. While some people might associate the name with the sport of boxing, that's not the origin! It's simply a day to relax, often spend time with family, and perhaps take advantage of post-Christmas sales. So, while the other options might be humorous or tangentially related to the word "boxing," the true meaning is tied to charity, service, and a well-deserved day off.
