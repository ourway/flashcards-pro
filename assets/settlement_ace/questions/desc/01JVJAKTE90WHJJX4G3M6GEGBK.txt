The National Lottery is a huge part of British culture, raising money for good causes across the UK. It was launched in 1994, and since then, billions of pounds have been distributed to charities, arts projects, sports initiatives, and heritage sites. Because it involves gambling, there are age restrictions in place to protect young people. While many things, like buying alcohol or voting, require you to be 18, the age to participate in the National Lottery is actually 16. This lower age reflects a view that at 16, young people are considered mature enough to make informed decisions about participating in games of chance with smaller stakes. You might think it's 18 because that's the age for many other legal activities, but the National Lottery has a specific age limit set at 16.
