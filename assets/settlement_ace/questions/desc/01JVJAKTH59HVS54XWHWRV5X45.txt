The Highland Clearances were a dark chapter in Scottish history, primarily occurring from the late 18th to the mid-19th centuries. Landlords, often motivated by economic gain, forcibly evicted tenants from their ancestral lands in the Scottish Highlands. The traditional system of small-scale farming, known as crofting, was replaced by large sheep farms. Sheep farming was seen as more profitable, driven by the demand for wool during the Industrial Revolution. Families were often displaced with little or no compensation, leading to immense suffering, poverty, and emigration. The Highland Clearances had a devastating impact on Gaelic culture and the social fabric of the Highlands. So, when we talk about the eradication of crofts to make way for large herds of livestock in Scotland, we're specifically referring to the Highland Clearances. The other options are incorrect because the Black Death was a plague, the Corn Removal is not a recognized historical event, and the Enlightenment was an intellectual movement.
