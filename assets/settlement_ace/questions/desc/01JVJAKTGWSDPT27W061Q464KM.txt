The 19th century saw a real revival of interest in earlier architectural styles, and one that particularly captured the imagination was the Gothic. Think about the Victorian era, a time of grand ambition and a fascination with history. Gothic architecture, with its pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses, offered a dramatic contrast to the more restrained styles that had preceded it. Architects and designers looked back to the medieval cathedrals and castles for inspiration, incorporating these elements into new buildings. This "Gothic Revival" wasn't just about aesthetics; it was also linked to ideas about morality and spirituality, with some believing that Gothic architecture represented a more honest and virtuous society. While Classical and Neoclassical styles were certainly present, they were more prominent in earlier periods. The 19th century was the era where Gothic had a major resurgence, making it the most accurate answer.
