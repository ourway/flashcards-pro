Alright, let's unravel the story behind the Bayeux Tapestry. This isn't just some old piece of cloth; it's a visual narrative of a pivotal moment in British history: the Norman Conquest of 1066. Think of it as a medieval comic strip, but embroidered! William, Duke of Normandy, crossed the English Channel and defeated King Harold at the Battle of Hastings. The Bayeux Tapestry, created shortly after the battle, vividly depicts the events leading up to the conquest, the battle itself, and its immediate aftermath, all from the Norman perspective. It's incredibly detailed, showing soldiers, ships, and even everyday life. So, when we say it's a commemorative piece for the Battle of Hastings, that's absolutely true. It was commissioned to celebrate William's victory and solidify his claim to the English throne. While other answers might seem plausible, the tapestry's central theme and historical context leave no doubt about its purpose. It's a Norman victory story stitched into history.
