Okay, let's talk about road tax, or Vehicle Excise Duty as it's officially known. For many years, drivers in the UK had to display a paper disc in their car windscreen to prove they'd paid their road tax. This disc showed the expiry date, and it was a legal requirement to have it visible. However, things changed significantly with the move towards digital record-keeping. Now, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, or DVLA, keeps an electronic record of all taxed vehicles. This means that police and other authorities can check if a car is taxed simply by scanning its number plate. So, if you pay your road tax online, there's no need to display a physical disc anymore. The system automatically updates, and your car is registered as taxed in the DVLA's database. It's all about efficiency and reducing paper waste. While some might still remember the days of the tax disc, those days are gone, and relying on that outdated knowledge could lead to confusion on the test.
