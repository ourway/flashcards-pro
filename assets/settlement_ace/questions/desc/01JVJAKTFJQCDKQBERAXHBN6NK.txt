The story of the MacDonalds of Glencoe is a particularly dark chapter in Scottish history, highlighting the importance of oaths and allegiance in the 17th century. Following the Jacobite uprising in 1689, King William III offered a pardon to all clans who swore an oath of allegiance by January 1, 1692. Alasdair MacIain, chief of the MacDonalds of Glencoe, was late in taking the oath due to various circumstances, including being misled about who was authorized to receive it. Despite eventually taking the oath, the delay was used as an excuse by enemies of the clan. In February 1692, government troops, who had been billeted with the MacDonalds for several days, turned on their hosts and massacred them. This event, known as the Glencoe Massacre, shocked Scotland and beyond. The MacDonalds faced dire consequences, not simply for being late with the oath, but because political rivals exploited the situation for their own gain. So, when you think of a Scottish clan and the dire consequences of refusing (or in this case, being late with) an oath, remember the tragic tale of the MacDonalds of Glencoe.
