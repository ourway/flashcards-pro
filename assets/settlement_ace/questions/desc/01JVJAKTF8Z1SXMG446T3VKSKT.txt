The Cabinet is a crucial part of the UK government, acting as the main advisory body to the Prime Minister. Think of it as the Prime Minister's top team of senior ministers. The Prime Minister is the head of the UK government and has the power to choose who will be in their Cabinet. This power comes from the fact that the Prime Minister is the leader of the political party that can command the confidence of the House of Commons. The Monarch, while the Head of State, acts on the advice of the Prime Minister and doesn't directly appoint Cabinet members. The Speaker's role is to preside over debates in the House of Commons, not to select the Cabinet. And while the people elect Members of Parliament, they don't directly choose Cabinet members. So, the Prime Minister's role as the leader of the government is why they are responsible for appointing the members of the Cabinet.
