The laws surrounding alcohol consumption in the UK can seem a bit nuanced. The general rule is that you must be 18 years old to purchase or consume alcohol in a pub, restaurant, or shop. This age reflects the broader legal framework where 18 is considered the age of adulthood, granting rights like voting and entering contracts. However, there's an exception designed to accommodate family dining. Sixteen and seventeen-year-olds are allowed to drink beer, cider, or wine with a table meal in a licensed premises, like a restaurant, as long as it's purchased by an adult. This exception acknowledges that alcohol can be part of a family meal in a responsible setting. So, while 18 is the standard drinking age, the provision for 16-year-olds consuming alcohol with a meal makes "Typically 18, but at 16 you can have a drink with a meal" the correct answer. It's a uniquely British compromise between strict regulation and cultural norms around dining.
