Okay, let's break down why a National Insurance number doesn't automatically mean someone has the right to work in the UK. Think of a National Insurance number like a social security number; it's primarily for tracking your tax contributions and entitlement to benefits. It's issued to most people who are living in the UK, including foreign nationals who are legally allowed to be here. However, having that number doesn't automatically grant you permission to work. To legally work in the UK, you need to have the right to reside and work, which is usually proven through things like a UK passport, proof of settled status, or a valid visa that permits employment. Someone might have a National Insurance number because they were previously allowed to work, or even because they're here for a reason other than employment, like studying. So, while a National Insurance number is essential for working, it's not proof in itself that someone is eligible to be employed. It's just one piece of the puzzle.
