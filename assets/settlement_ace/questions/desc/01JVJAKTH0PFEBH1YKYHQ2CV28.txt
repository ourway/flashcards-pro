Pantomimes, or "pantos" as they're affectionately known, are a beloved British theatrical tradition deeply intertwined with the Christmas season. Think of them as a festive, family-friendly spectacle filled with slapstick comedy, audience participation, and often based on well-known fairy tales. The tradition really took hold in the Victorian era, building on earlier forms of comedic theatre. The Christmas connection is key because pantomimes provide lighthearted entertainment during the holiday period, offering a fun outing for families. The elaborate costumes, sing-along songs, and the classic "He's behind you!" moments all contribute to the festive atmosphere. While you might see theatrical productions at other times of the year, pantomimes are specifically associated with Christmas and the New Year, making it the only correct answer. Easter, Summer and St David's Day are not associated with this theatrical tradition.
