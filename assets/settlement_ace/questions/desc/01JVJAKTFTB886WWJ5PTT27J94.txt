The Phone Book and Yellow Pages are primarily directories designed to help you find contact information for businesses and residents. Think of them as comprehensive listings for everyday needs. While these publications are incredibly useful for finding local services like plumbers or restaurants, they don't typically include details of elected officials. Information about Assembly members, Members of Parliament (MPs), Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) and Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) is usually available through official government websites, parliamentary records, or dedicated directories focused on political representatives. These sources provide more comprehensive and up-to-date information about elected officials and their roles. So, while the Phone Book and Yellow Pages are great for finding a local pizza place, you'll need to look elsewhere for details about your political representatives.
