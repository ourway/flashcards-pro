The quest to break the four-minute mile was a huge deal in the 1950s. People thought it might even be physically impossible! Running a mile that fast required incredible speed and endurance. Several athletes were close, but it was Sir Roger Bannister who finally achieved this historic feat on May 6, 1954, at Iffley Road track in Oxford. He ran it in 3 minutes and 59.4 seconds, making him a national hero. While Sir Chris Hoy is a celebrated cyclist, David Weir a Paralympian track and road athlete, and Mo Farah a long-distance running legend, their achievements are in different fields or came later. Bannister's accomplishment was a groundbreaking moment in athletics, making him the correct answer. It's a great example of British sporting history!
