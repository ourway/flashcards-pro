The Commonwealth is indeed a voluntary association of 56 independent and equal countries. Its roots trace back to the British Empire, but it evolved significantly. After World War II, many former colonies gained independence, and the Commonwealth was reimagined as a cooperative partnership rather than a hierarchical empire. The key is that membership is based on free and equal voluntary co-operation. Member states support each other in areas like democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and economic development. Think of it as a global network where countries share knowledge, resources, and work together to achieve common goals. So, the statement is true because the Commonwealth is fundamentally about mutual support and shared objectives among its member nations. It's not just a historical relic; it's an active organization working on global challenges.
