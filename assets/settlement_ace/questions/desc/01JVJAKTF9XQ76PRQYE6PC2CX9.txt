Even though the UK officially left the European Union on January 31, 2020, and the transition period ended on December 31, 2020, the legacy of EU law continues to have an impact. During the UK's membership, which spanned from 1973, when it joined the European Economic Community, until its exit, a vast body of EU law was integrated into the UK legal system. To manage this transition, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 was passed. This Act essentially converted existing EU law into UK law to ensure a smooth legal transition. While the UK Parliament now has the power to amend or repeal these laws, many remain in effect. Therefore, EU law, as it was adopted and implemented during the UK's membership, remains a significant source of law in Britain, particularly in areas like environmental regulations, employment law, and consumer protection. It's not that new EU laws are being created for the UK, but rather that the laws adopted during membership are still relevant.
