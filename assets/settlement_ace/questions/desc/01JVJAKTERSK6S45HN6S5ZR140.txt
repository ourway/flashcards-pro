Britain's journey to becoming a fully democratic nation was a gradual process that unfolded over centuries. While the 19th century saw significant reforms, it wasn't until the 20th century that true universal suffrage was achieved. Think about it: in the early 1800s, only a small percentage of the population, primarily wealthy landowners, had the right to vote. The Great Reform Act of 1832 was a step forward, expanding the electorate, but it still excluded large segments of society, including most working-class men and all women. Later reforms, like the 1867 and 1884 Reform Acts, continued to broaden suffrage, but significant restrictions remained. It wasn't until 1918, with the Representation of the People Act, that most men over 21 and some women over 30 gained the right to vote. Full equal suffrage for men and women wasn't achieved until 1928. So, while the 19th century laid the groundwork, it's inaccurate to say Britain was a fully democratic nation during that time.
