In British political history, coalition governments are relatively rare, but they do happen when no single party wins a clear majority in a general election. The 2010 general election resulted in what's called a hung parliament, meaning no party had enough seats to govern alone. Now, the two largest parties were the Conservatives and Labour, but neither had a majority. To form a government, they needed to team up with another party. While a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition was considered, ultimately, the Conservatives, led by David Cameron, and the Liberal Democrats, led by Nick Clegg, negotiated a coalition agreement. This was a significant moment because the Liberal Democrats, traditionally a centrist party, hadn't been in government for a long time. The coalition lasted for five years, until the 2015 election, and it shaped British politics during that period. So, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats joining forces in 2010 is the correct answer because it reflects this specific historical outcome of that election.
