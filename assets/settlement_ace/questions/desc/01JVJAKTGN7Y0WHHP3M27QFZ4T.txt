William Caxton's arrival in England with his printing press in 1476 was a pivotal moment in English history. Before this, books were painstakingly handwritten, making them expensive and rare. Caxton set up his printing press in Westminster, London, and began producing books in English. 'The Canterbury Tales,' written by Geoffrey Chaucer in the late 14th century, was one of the first major works he printed. This was significant because it helped to standardise the English language and make literature more accessible to a wider audience. While Caxton printed many other important works, the fact that he chose 'The Canterbury Tales' early on highlights its importance in English literary history and its appeal even then. So, the statement is true because 'The Canterbury Tales' was indeed among the first books to come off Caxton's press, marking a turning point in how people accessed and consumed literature.
