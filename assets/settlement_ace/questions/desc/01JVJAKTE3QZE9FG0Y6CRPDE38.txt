The 'Black Death' is a grim but important part of British and European history. It refers to a devastating pandemic, specifically a form of bubonic plague, that swept through Europe in the mid-14th century, peaking around 1348. The name 'Black Death' comes from the dark blotches that appeared on the skin of those infected. This wasn't just a minor outbreak; it's estimated to have killed between 30% to 60% of Europe's population. Imagine the sheer scale of devastation! The plague was primarily spread by fleas living on rodents, and the unsanitary conditions of the time helped it spread rapidly. While lack of water or food could certainly cause hardship, and battles led to casualties, neither caused the widespread death and societal upheaval associated with the Black Death. It was a disease, specifically the bubonic plague, that earned this infamous title in history.
