Police and Crime Commissioners, or PCCs, were established in 2012 to make policing more accountable to the public. Think of it this way: before PCCs, police authorities, often made up of local councillors, oversaw the police. The idea behind PCCs was to give the public a direct say in how their local police force is run. So, the public directly elects these individuals in elections, usually held every four years. Their job is to set the police force's priorities, control the police budget, and even appoint the Chief Constable. This direct election is key because it ensures that the police are responsive to the needs and concerns of the local community. While the Home Office does have overall responsibility for policing in England and Wales, and MPs debate policing matters in Parliament, neither of them directly elect the PCCs. The police themselves also don't elect the PCC, as the goal is civilian oversight. The whole point is that the public gets to choose who oversees their local police force, making them accountable to the people they serve.
