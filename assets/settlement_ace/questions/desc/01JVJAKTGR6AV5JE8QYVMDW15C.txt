Okay, let's break down why the UK's system of government is accurately described as a parliamentary democracy. The key here is understanding what each of those terms means and how they apply to the UK. "Democracy" means that the ultimate power resides with the people, who exercise that power through voting in elections. "Parliamentary" means that the elected parliament is the supreme law-making body. In the UK, citizens vote for Members of Parliament (MPs) to represent them in the House of Commons. The political party that wins a majority of seats in the Commons usually forms the government, with its leader becoming the Prime Minister. Parliament then makes laws, scrutinizes the government, and debates important issues. While the UK also has a monarch, their role is largely symbolic and ceremonial; real political power rests with the elected Parliament. So, because the UK has free and fair elections, and the elected Parliament holds the power to govern, it's definitely correct to call it a parliamentary democracy. Some might think the monarchy contradicts this, but remember, the monarch reigns but doesn't rule.
