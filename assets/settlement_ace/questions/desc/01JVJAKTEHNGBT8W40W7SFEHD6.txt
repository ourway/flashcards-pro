D-Day, which took place on June 6, 1944, was the day Allied forces launched a massive invasion of Normandy in northern France. This operation, codenamed Operation Overlord, was a crucial turning point in World War II, marking the beginning of the liberation of Western Europe from Nazi occupation. The scale of the invasion was immense, involving thousands of ships, aircraft, and soldiers from countries like the United States, Britain, and Canada. The other options refer to different events during the war. The "Dunkirk spirit" refers to the evacuation of British soldiers from Dunkirk in 1940, a moment of resilience but not an invasion. The Battle of Britain was an aerial campaign fought over Britain in the summer of 1940, and the Blitz was the sustained bombing of British cities by the Germans. While all significant events, none of them involved the Allied forces landing in Normandy to begin liberating Europe, which is why D-Day is the correct answer.
