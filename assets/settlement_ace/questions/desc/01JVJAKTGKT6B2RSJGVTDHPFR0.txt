Okay, let's talk about the creation of Great Britain. Before 1707, you had the separate kingdoms of England and Scotland, each with its own parliament. Queen Anne was the monarch of both, but there was a growing sense that a closer union would be beneficial, especially for economic reasons. England wanted to secure a Protestant succession, and Scotland hoped to gain access to England's trade routes. The Act of Union, passed in 1707, was the legal mechanism that formally merged these two kingdoms into one: the Kingdom of Great Britain. It dissolved the English and Scottish Parliaments and created a new Parliament of Great Britain at Westminster. So, the Act of Union is the specific piece of legislation that brought about this unification. The other options relate to different aspects of British history and governance. The Bill of Rights, for example, was a landmark act of 1689 that limited the power of the monarchy, but it predates the union. The Act of Government of Wales refers to later legislation concerning Wales's governance, and The Kingdom Act is not a recognised piece of legislation in British history.
