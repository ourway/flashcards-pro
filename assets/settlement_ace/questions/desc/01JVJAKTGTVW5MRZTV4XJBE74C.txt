English exploration and colonization really took off during the reign of Elizabeth I, in the late 16th century. While figures like John Cabot had explored North America earlier, it was under Elizabeth that England started seriously establishing colonies. Think about it: the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 weakened Spain's naval power, opening the seas for English ventures. People like Sir Walter Raleigh attempted to found colonies like Roanoke in what is now North Carolina. Although Roanoke failed, it represents a crucial early effort. Mary I, Elizabeth's predecessor, was more focused on religious matters within England. William I, or William the Conqueror, lived way back in the 11th century, long before America was even on England's radar for colonization. So, while other monarchs were important, Elizabeth I's reign marks the true beginning of English colonization in America.
