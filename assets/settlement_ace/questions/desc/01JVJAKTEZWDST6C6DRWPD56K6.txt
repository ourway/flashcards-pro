During the 16th and 17th centuries, Britain experienced a significant influx of artistic talent from continental Europe. This was a period of immense cultural and political change, with the Reformation and the rise of powerful monarchies shaping artistic patronage and styles. Many British artists were still developing their skills and styles, so wealthy patrons, including the royal family, often commissioned artists from abroad who were already masters of their craft. Think of figures like Hans Holbein the Younger, a German artist who became court painter to Henry VIII in the 16th century. His portraits defined the image of the Tudor court. Later, in the 17th century, artists like Sir Peter Lely, originally from Germany, dominated the art scene during the reign of Charles II. These artists brought with them new techniques, styles, and perspectives, significantly influencing the development of British art. So, the statement is true because Britain actively attracted and relied on the skills of foreign painters to meet the demands of its elite and to enrich its artistic landscape.
