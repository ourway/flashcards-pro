The small claims procedure in England and Wales is designed to be a more straightforward and less expensive way to resolve disputes compared to going through a full trial. Think of it as a streamlined process for smaller disagreements. The key here is understanding the monetary limit that defines what qualifies as a "small claim." This limit is currently set at £10,000. So, if you have a claim for, say, faulty goods or a minor debt that's less than or equal to this amount, you can use this procedure. Claims exceeding £10,000 would typically be handled through different court tracks, which involve more complex procedures and potentially higher costs. It's worth noting that this limit can be subject to change, so always double-check the latest guidelines. While £5,000 might seem like a plausible lower limit, and £15,000 or £50,000 might sound like amounts that would still qualify for a simplified process, the specific threshold that defines a small claim is £10,000.
