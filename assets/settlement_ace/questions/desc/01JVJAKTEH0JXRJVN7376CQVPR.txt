Okay, let's talk about how books became more accessible in England. Before the printing press, books were painstakingly handwritten, making them incredibly expensive and rare. Only the wealthy and religious institutions could afford them. Then came along Johannes Gutenberg in Germany, who developed a printing press with movable type in the mid-15th century. This invention revolutionized the spread of information. Now, specifically in England, it was William Caxton who first brought this technology and set up a printing press in 1476. He started printing books in English, making them available to a wider audience. Caxton's press was located in Westminster, London, and he printed popular works like "The Canterbury Tales" by Geoffrey Chaucer, helping to standardize the English language and promote literacy. While Chaucer was a famous writer, and Shakespeare came later, Caxton was the key figure in introducing the printing press to England.
