Sir Robert Walpole is a key figure when we talk about the development of British politics because he's generally regarded as the first Prime Minister. Now, the idea of a single, dominant figure leading the government wasn't really established before him. Think back to the early 18th century, after Queen Anne's reign. The Hanoverian kings, George I and George II, weren't particularly fluent in English or familiar with British politics. This created an opportunity for a skilled politician to take on a more prominent role. Walpole, with his political acumen and ability to manage Parliament, stepped into that void. He served as First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Leader of the House of Commons. His long period in office, from 1721 to 1742, really solidified the position of a leading minister who could command the confidence of both the monarch and Parliament. So, that's why 1721-1742 is the correct period; it marks the era when the foundations of the modern Prime Minister's office were truly laid. The other dates are incorrect because they fall outside of Walpole's time in power.
