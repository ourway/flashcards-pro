The Welsh government, officially known as the Senedd Cymru or Welsh Parliament, plays a crucial role in shaping laws and policies specific to Wales. Understanding its structure is key to understanding Welsh governance. The Senedd is made up of elected representatives called Assembly Members, or AMs. The number of AMs is set at 60. These AMs are responsible for debating and passing laws on devolved matters, meaning areas where the Welsh government has been granted authority by the UK Parliament. These areas include things like health, education, and the environment. So, when you think about the number of AMs, remember it's 60 - the same as the number of seconds in a minute! It's easy to get confused with the number of MPs in the UK Parliament, which is much larger, but the Welsh government is a separate entity with its own distinct number of representatives.
