Allotments are a really interesting part of British social history, and they're still popular today. Think of them as community gardens, but on a smaller, individual scale. The idea of allotments really took off in the 19th century, driven by the Industrial Revolution. As more people moved to cities for work, they lost access to land for growing food. Allotments provided a way for working-class families to supplement their diets with fresh produce. Legislation like the Allotments Act of 1908 even gave local authorities the power to provide land for this purpose. During both World Wars, allotments became even more crucial for food security, with campaigns like "Dig for Victory" encouraging everyone to grow their own. So, while the other options – a menorah (a Jewish candelabrum), hill forts (ancient defensive structures), and Canute (an Anglo-Saxon king) – are all part of British history and culture, they have nothing to do with renting land for growing food. Allotments are specifically plots of land rented out for cultivation, making it the only logical answer.
