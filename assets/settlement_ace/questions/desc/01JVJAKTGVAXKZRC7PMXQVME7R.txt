Okay, let's break down the role of District Judges and Deputy District Judges in Northern Ireland. The key thing to remember is that the legal system, no matter where you are, relies on qualified professionals. In Northern Ireland, District Judges and their deputies are integral to the court system, handling a wide range of cases in the County Courts and Magistrates' Courts. To become a judge, rigorous legal training and experience are essential prerequisites. Think of it like this: you wouldn't want an unqualified doctor performing surgery, right? Similarly, the legal system demands expertise. Because these judges are qualified legal professionals dedicating their careers to upholding the law, they are, of course, compensated for their work. It's a full-time job requiring significant skill and responsibility. The idea that they wouldn't be paid simply doesn't align with how any functioning legal system operates.
