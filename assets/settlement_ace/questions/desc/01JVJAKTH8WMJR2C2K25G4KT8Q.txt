The struggle for women's suffrage in the UK was a long and hard-fought battle that unfolded over decades, not overnight. While some women gained the right to vote in 1918, it wasn't on equal terms with men. This initial act only granted voting rights to women over 30 who met certain property qualifications. The idea was to reward women who had supported the war effort during World War I, but it still excluded many younger and working-class women. It wasn't until the Equal Franchise Act of 1928 that women finally achieved voting equality with men, who could vote from the age of 21. This act lowered the voting age for women to 21, putting them on the same footing as their male counterparts. Therefore, the statement that women were granted the right to vote at the same age as men in 1982 is incorrect because this milestone was actually reached much earlier, in 1928.
