Okay, let's talk about how the UK government is structured. The Prime Minister doesn't rule alone; they need a team to help run the country. This team is made up of ministers, who are senior Members of Parliament chosen by the Prime Minister. These ministers are in charge of different government departments, like the Department for Education, the Home Office, or the Treasury. Now, while the total number of ministers can fluctuate a bit, the Prime Minister typically appoints around 20 senior MPs to lead these key departments. Think of it like a cabinet of trusted advisors, each responsible for a specific area of national life. It's not as small as 10, which wouldn't cover all the necessary departments, and 30 or 40 would be a bit too unwieldy for effective decision-making at the top level. So, around 20 is the right number for the core group of senior ministers heading up departments.
