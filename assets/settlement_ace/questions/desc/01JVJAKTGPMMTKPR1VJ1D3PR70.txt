Eid ul Adha, often called the "Festival of Sacrifice," is one of the most important holidays in the Islamic calendar. To understand why it's linked to Prophet Ibrahim, known as Abraham in Judaism and Christianity, we need to delve into the story behind it. The holiday commemorates Ibrahim's unwavering faith and obedience to God. According to the story, God commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice his son, Ismail. Ibrahim was prepared to follow this divine command, demonstrating his complete submission to God's will. However, at the last moment, God intervened and provided a ram to be sacrificed instead. So, the statement is true because Eid ul Adha directly commemorates this act of devotion and God's mercy. It's a time for Muslims to reflect on their own faith and willingness to make sacrifices for God. While some might think it's about a different prophet or a different act, the core of Eid ul Adha is specifically tied to Ibrahim's test of faith and his willingness to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God.
