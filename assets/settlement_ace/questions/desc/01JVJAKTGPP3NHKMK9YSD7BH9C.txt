The Black Death, one of history's most devastating pandemics, is firmly situated within the Middle Ages. To understand why, think about the timeline of British history. The Middle Ages generally span from the 5th to the 15th centuries, roughly from the end of the Roman Empire to the start of the Tudor period. The Black Death itself ravaged Europe, including Britain, in the mid-14th century, specifically around 1348-1350. This puts it squarely in the medieval period. The disease, likely bubonic plague, wiped out a huge percentage of the population, leading to massive social and economic upheaval. The other options are incorrect because they represent vastly different eras. The Stone Age and Iron Age are prehistoric periods, long before written records of plagues. The Golden Age is a term often used to describe periods of prosperity and cultural flourishing, like the Elizabethan era, which came *after* the Middle Ages. So, when you think of the Black Death, remember it as a defining, and devastating, event of the Middle Ages.
