Cricket's origins are deeply rooted in the south of England, dating back as far as the 16th century. While the exact origins are debated, most historians agree that it evolved from earlier bat-and-ball games played by children in the Weald, an area of woodland and open country in Kent and Sussex. By the 17th century, cricket had become a popular sport, and the first formal cricket clubs were established in England. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), founded in 1787, became the guardian of the laws of the game, solidifying England's central role in its development and spread. So, while other nations like Australia have embraced and excelled at cricket, the sport's birthplace and the nation most closely associated with its early development and codification is undoubtedly England. It's a sport that evokes images of quintessential English scenes, like village greens and afternoon tea during matches, further cementing its English identity.
