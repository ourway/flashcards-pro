St Andrews is synonymous with golf for a very good reason: it's where the game as we know it really took shape. While the exact origins of golf are debated, St Andrews Links is considered the oldest golf course in the world, with evidence suggesting golf was played there as early as the 15th century. The Old Course at St Andrews is particularly famous and has hosted The Open Championship, one of golf's major tournaments, a staggering 29 times. The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, founded in 1754, also plays a key role in governing the sport worldwide. So, while the other options might be associated with saints, St Andrews is uniquely tied to the history and development of golf, earning it the title 'home of golf'.
