Wales, while a proud and culturally distinct part of the United Kingdom, has a relatively small population compared to England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Think about the geography of the UK: England is the largest country, both in landmass and population, and is home to major cities like London, Birmingham, and Manchester. Scotland also has a significant land area and population centers. Wales, nestled to the west of England, is smaller and more mountainous, which has historically limited its population density. Northern Ireland, though a separate region, also contributes to the overall UK population. Therefore, when considering the distribution, Wales accounts for approximately 5% of the total UK population. The other options, 3%, 4%, and 7%, are incorrect because they either underestimate or overestimate the actual proportion of people living in Wales. Remembering that Wales is a smaller part of the overall UK picture helps to solidify the 5% figure.
