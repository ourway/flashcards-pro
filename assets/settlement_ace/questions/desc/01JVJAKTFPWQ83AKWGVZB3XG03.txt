World War One, also known as the Great War, was a global conflict that lasted from 1914 to 1918. It involved many of the world's great powers, and it was one of the deadliest conflicts in history. After years of intense fighting and staggering losses on all sides, Germany finally sought an armistice, which is essentially an agreement to stop fighting. This armistice was signed between the Allies and Germany in a railway carriage in Compiègne, France. The agreement specifically stated that the ceasefire would begin at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month – that's 11:00 am on November 11, 1918. This precise timing was chosen to ensure that news of the armistice would reach all fighting fronts simultaneously, minimizing further casualties. The date and time have since become symbolic, and November 11th is commemorated as Remembrance Day or Armistice Day in many countries, including the UK, to honour those who died in the war. So, the statement about the war ending on the eleventh hour, of the eleventh day, of the eleventh month in 1918 is indeed true.
