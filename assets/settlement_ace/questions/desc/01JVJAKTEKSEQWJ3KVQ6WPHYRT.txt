Okay, let's break down the 'Divine Right of Kings'. This idea was really popular with monarchs like James I and his son Charles I back in the 17th century. Basically, they believed their authority to rule came directly from God. It wasn't about being chosen by the people, or even by powerful nobles. They thought God had specifically selected them to be king, making them answerable only to God, not to earthly powers like Parliament. This concept is why it's called 'divine' â€“ relating to a deity. James I, who ruled from 1603, was a big believer in this, and Charles I, who followed him, doubled down on it. This belief put them on a collision course with Parliament, who felt they should have a say in how the country was run. This clash ultimately led to the English Civil War and Charles I's execution in 1649. So, when you hear 'Divine Right of Kings', remember it's all about the idea that God appointed the king, not any person or institution on Earth.
