Imagine Britain thousands of years ago, long before any written records. The very first people to live there arrived during the Stone Age, following herds of animals and gathering wild plants for food. These weren't inventors building complex machines, or pirates sailing the seas, or even the Romans with their organized legions. Instead, they were nomadic groups of hunter-gatherers. They moved with the seasons, using simple tools made of stone and bone to hunt animals like deer and wild boar, and to collect nuts, berries, and roots. This way of life was essential for survival in the harsh environment of prehistoric Britain. The Romans arrived much later, starting in 43 AD, and while they made a huge impact, they certainly weren't the first inhabitants. So, when you think about the earliest Britons, picture these resourceful hunter-gatherers, the true pioneers of the land.
