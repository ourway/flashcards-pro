Okay, so the Prime Minister in the UK isn't like a president who's directly elected by everyone for a fixed term. Instead, we have a parliamentary system. The public votes for a Member of Parliament, or MP, to represent their local area. The political party that wins the majority of these seats in the House of Commons gets to form the government. The leader of that winning party then becomes the Prime Minister. Now, because the Prime Minister's power comes from leading that party, it's the *governing party* that ultimately has the power to replace them during their term. If the party feels the Prime Minister isn't performing well, or if there's a leadership challenge, they can hold a vote to choose a new leader. That new leader then becomes the Prime Minister. The Monarch's role is largely ceremonial, and while individual MPs can express no confidence, it's the party that has the real power to instigate a change at the top. Think of it like a company board replacing its CEO â€“ it's an internal decision within the governing structure.
