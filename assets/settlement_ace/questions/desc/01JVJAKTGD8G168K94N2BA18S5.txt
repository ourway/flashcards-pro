Alfred Hitchcock, often called the "Master of Suspense," is a towering figure in British cinema history. He's renowned for his psychological thrillers, and one of his early masterpieces is "The 39 Steps." This film, released in 1935, is a classic example of his signature style, featuring suspense, mistaken identity, and a thrilling chase across the Scottish Highlands. David Lean, on the other hand, is known for his epic historical dramas like "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Doctor Zhivago," which came much later. So, while both were incredibly talented British directors, they worked in different genres and eras. The suggestion that David Lean directed "The 39 Steps" in 1980 is incorrect on two counts: Hitchcock directed it, and it was released decades earlier than that. It's easy to get directors mixed up, but remembering Hitchcock's association with suspense and "The 39 Steps" specifically will help you avoid this kind of trick question.
