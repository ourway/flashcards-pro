The relationship between the UK and the Channel Islands is a unique one, rooted in history. These islands, located off the coast of France, have been linked to the British Crown since the Norman Conquest in 1066. William the Conqueror, who became King of England, was also the Duke of Normandy. The Channel Islands were part of that Duchy. While England and Normandy eventually separated, the Channel Islands remained loyal to the English Crown. This is why they're considered Crown Dependencies, not part of the UK itself. They have their own governments, laws, and even their own currencies. The UK is responsible for their defense and international relations, but internally, they're self-governing. Wales, on the other hand, is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, fully integrated politically and legally. The Falkland Islands and St Helena are British Overseas Territories, with a different constitutional relationship to the UK, involving greater UK control. So, the Channel Islands stand out because of their specific historical ties to the Crown through the Duchy of Normandy, making them a dependency rather than an integral part of the UK.
