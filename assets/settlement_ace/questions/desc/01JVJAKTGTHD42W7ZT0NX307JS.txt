The Tate art gallery is synonymous with London's vibrant art scene. While there are indeed Tate galleries in other locations like Liverpool and St Ives, the original and most prominent one is in London. It was founded in 1897 as the National Gallery of British Art, later renamed the Tate Gallery after Henry Tate, who provided the initial collection. The main gallery, now known as Tate Britain, focuses on British art from the Tudor period to the present day. Tate Modern, another major part of the Tate in London, is dedicated to international modern and contemporary art and is housed in a former power station on the banks of the Thames. So, while Edinburgh, Manchester, and Cardiff are all important cities in the UK, they don't house the primary Tate gallery, which remains a cornerstone of London's cultural landscape.
