The Magna Carta, or "Great Charter," is one of the most important documents in English history, dating back to 1215. Think of it as a foundational stone for democracy and the rule of law. King John was forced to agree to it by a group of rebellious barons. Before Magna Carta, the King had almost unlimited power. The document limited the power of the monarch and established principles like due process and the right to a fair trial. It stated that everyone, including the King, was subject to the law. The name itself, "Magna Carta," literally translates to "Great Charter" from Latin. While the other options might sound like important legal or historical concepts, they don't reflect the actual meaning or historical significance of this specific document. It's a cornerstone of British legal history, and remembering its translated name helps understand its grand importance.
