The role of the monarch in the UK has evolved significantly over centuries. Historically, the monarch held considerable power, directly influencing government policy and decisions. However, through a gradual process, power shifted towards Parliament, particularly the House of Commons. Today, the Queen's functions are primarily symbolic and ceremonial. While she remains Head of State, her involvement in political matters is limited. She opens each new session of Parliament, approves legislation, and appoints the Prime Minister, but these actions are largely formal. The real political power lies with the elected government. The Queen meets regularly with the Prime Minister, and during these audiences, she can offer advice, warnings, and encouragement based on her extensive experience and knowledge. However, she cannot dictate policy or make decisions on government matters. The Prime Minister leads the government, the Speaker maintains order in the House of Commons, and the police enforce the law â€“ all wielding practical authority that the Queen does not.
