The 18th century was a truly transformative period in European history, marked by a surge of intellectual and philosophical advancements known as the Enlightenment. Think of it as a time when people started questioning traditional authority and embracing reason and logic as primary tools for understanding the world. Key figures like John Locke, Isaac Newton, and Voltaire championed ideas about individual rights, scientific inquiry, and separation of powers, which had a profound impact on society and politics. This era saw the rise of scientific societies, increased literacy, and a growing emphasis on education. The Enlightenmentâ€™s emphasis on reason and individual liberty directly influenced major events like the American and French Revolutions. So, when we talk about the 18th century and the rise of innovative ideas in politics, philosophy, and science, we're essentially describing the core tenets of the Enlightenment. That's why the statement is true; the 18th century is practically synonymous with this influential movement.
