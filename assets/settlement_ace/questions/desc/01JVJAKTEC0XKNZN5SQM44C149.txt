Okay, let's break down the question about the Prime Minister and lifetime roles. The key here is understanding the House of Lords and the concept of "peers." The UK Parliament is bicameral, meaning it has two chambers: the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The House of Lords is made up of Lords Spiritual (senior bishops of the Church of England) and Lords Temporal, also known as peers. Now, these peers can be hereditary, meaning their title is passed down through their family, or they can be appointed for life. Since 1958, the Prime Minister has had the power to nominate individuals to become life peers. This is a way to recognize their achievements and contributions to society, and it allows them to participate in the legislative process by debating and voting on laws in the House of Lords. The Monarch, while the head of state, doesn't get assigned by the Prime Minister, and the Speaker is elected by the House of Commons to preside over debates there, not appointed for life by the PM. So, the Prime Minister's ability to create lifetime peers is a significant power related to the composition of the House of Lords.
