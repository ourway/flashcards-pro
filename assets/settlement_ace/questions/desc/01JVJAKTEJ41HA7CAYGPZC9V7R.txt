Northern Irish banknotes, while not issued by the Bank of England, are indeed accepted as legal currency throughout the UK. To understand why, it's helpful to know that several banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland are authorized to issue their own banknotes. These notes are technically promissory notes, a pledge from the issuing bank to pay the bearer the stated amount. While only Bank of England notes are technically "legal tender" in England and Wales, meaning they must be accepted as payment for debts, the reality is that Northern Irish and Scottish banknotes are widely accepted across the UK due to long-standing custom and practice. Think of it like this: while a shopkeeper isn't legally *obligated* to accept them in England, they usually do! This acceptance reflects the integrated nature of the UK's economy and the trust placed in these established banking institutions. It's a common misconception that they are not accepted because they look different, but their validity is guaranteed by the issuing banks.
