The Industrial Revolution, which really took off in the late 1700s and throughout the 1800s, brought about huge changes in how things were made, but it also came with a dark side for many workers. Factories and mines sprung up, offering jobs, but these jobs often came with terrible conditions. Think of long hours â€“ often 12 to 16 hours a day, six days a week. The environments were frequently dangerous, with little to no safety regulations. Accidents were common, and workers could easily be injured or even killed. Child labor was also widespread, with children as young as five or six working in these harsh conditions. Because there were few laws to protect workers' rights, employers could get away with paying low wages and imposing strict discipline. So, when we talk about working conditions during the Industrial Revolution, "very poor" is the most accurate description because it reflects the harsh realities faced by the working class during this period of rapid industrial growth. While some might think "average" or "acceptable" could apply, those words don't capture the widespread exploitation and danger that were characteristic of the era.
