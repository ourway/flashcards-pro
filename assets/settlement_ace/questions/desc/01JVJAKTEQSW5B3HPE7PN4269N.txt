The Great Depression, a severe worldwide economic downturn that began in 1929 and lasted throughout the 1930s, had a devastating impact on global trade and industry. Shipbuilding, in particular, suffered immensely. This industry relies heavily on international commerce, as ships are essential for transporting goods across the globe. When the Depression hit, global trade plummeted as countries imposed tariffs and protectionist measures to safeguard their own economies. This led to a drastic reduction in demand for new ships. Companies simply weren't shipping as much, so they didn't need new vessels. Existing ships were often laid up, unused, further reducing the need for new construction. While other industries like housing, automobiles, and aviation certainly felt the pinch, shipbuilding was uniquely vulnerable due to its direct link to international trade, making it one of the hardest-hit sectors during this period.
