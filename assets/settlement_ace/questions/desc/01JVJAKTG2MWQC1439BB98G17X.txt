World War II was a global conflict fought from 1939 to 1945, primarily between the Axis and Allied powers. The key Allied nations included Great Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, along with many other countries like Poland. These nations united to fight against the Axis powers, who were led by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan. Japan's expansionist policies in Asia put them directly at odds with the interests of the Allies. Think about the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 â€“ that was a key event that brought the United States into the war against Japan and solidified Japan's position as an enemy of the Allies. So, while the Soviet Union, France, and Poland were all fighting alongside the UK against Germany, Japan was firmly on the other side, making it the only country from the list that was not an ally of the UK during World War II.
