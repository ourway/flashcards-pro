Gothic architecture, popular from the 12th to 16th centuries, experienced a revival in the 19th century known as Gothic Revival or Neo-Gothic. This style is characterized by pointed arches, ribbed vaults, flying buttresses, and ornate decorations. The Houses of Parliament, officially known as the Palace of Westminster, is a prime example of this revival. Rebuilt after a fire in 1834, architects Charles Barry and Augustus Pugin embraced the Gothic style to evoke a sense of history and tradition. Similarly, St Pancras Station, completed in 1868, is renowned for its magnificent train shed and the attached Midland Grand Hotel, both designed by George Gilbert Scott in the Gothic Revival style. The hotel's elaborate facade, with its pointed windows and intricate stonework, makes it a stunning example of Victorian Gothic architecture. While Buckingham Palace primarily reflects a neoclassical style and St Paul's Cathedral is a Baroque masterpiece, the Houses of Parliament and St Pancras Station stand out as iconic 19th-century London landmarks that truly embody the Gothic architectural style.
