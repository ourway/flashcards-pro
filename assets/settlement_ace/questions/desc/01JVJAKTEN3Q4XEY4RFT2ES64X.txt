Scotland, known for its rugged landscapes and rich history, has several iconic landmarks. Edinburgh Castle, perched atop Castle Rock in Scotland's capital city, is a prime example. It has served as a royal residence, military garrison, and prison throughout its long history, dating back to at least the 12th century. Loch Lomond, part of the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, is the largest lake in Great Britain by surface area and is renowned for its stunning natural beauty. The other options are located elsewhere in the UK. The Eden Project, with its distinctive biomes, is actually located in Cornwall, England. The Giant's Causeway, with its unique basalt columns, is found across the sea in Northern Ireland. So, while all are beautiful places to visit in the UK, only Edinburgh Castle and Loch Lomond are located within the borders of Scotland.
