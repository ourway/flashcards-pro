NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was formed in 1949 in the aftermath of World War II. Its primary goal was to create a collective security system, essentially a promise between member states that an attack on one would be considered an attack on all. This mutual defense pact was designed to deter aggression, particularly from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. While NATO's focus is on external threats, the very nature of a collective security agreement inherently promotes peace and stability *among* its member nations. By committing to defend each other, NATO members reduce the likelihood of conflict arising between themselves. It's like a team working together; they're less likely to fight each other if they're united against a common opponent. So, while NATO's main purpose isn't *solely* to ensure peace between members, its structure and objectives certainly contribute to that outcome, making the statement true.
