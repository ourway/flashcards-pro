The Blitz refers specifically to the period of sustained strategic bombing of the United Kingdom by Nazi Germany between September 1940 and May 1941, during the Second World War. The name "Blitz" comes from the German word "Blitzkrieg," meaning "lightning war." This intense aerial bombardment targeted major British cities like London, Coventry, and Liverpool, aiming to cripple British industry and morale. While the Battle of Britain involved air combat over Britain, it was primarily a fight between fighter planes, not the bombing of cities. D-Day was the Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944, a completely different event. And the "Dunkirk spirit" refers to the evacuation of Allied soldiers from Dunkirk in 1940, a moment of resilience but not related to bombing. So, when you hear about the bombing of English cities during World War II, remember "The Blitz" â€“ a period of intense hardship and a testament to British resilience.
