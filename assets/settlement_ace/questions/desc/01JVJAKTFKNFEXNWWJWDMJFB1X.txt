Hanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, is an eight-day Jewish holiday commemorating the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem during the second century BCE. The story goes that when the Maccabees, a Jewish rebel army, reclaimed the Temple from the Seleucid Empire, they found only enough oil to light the Temple's menorah for one day. Miraculously, the oil lasted for eight days, giving them time to produce more. To remember this miracle, Jewish families celebrate Hanukkah for eight nights. Each night, they light one additional candle on a special candelabrum called a menorah or hanukkiah. The first night, one candle is lit, the second night, two candles are lit, and so on, until all eight candles are lit on the final night. It's a joyous time filled with special foods, games, and of course, the warm glow of the menorah reminding everyone of the enduring power of faith and perseverance.
