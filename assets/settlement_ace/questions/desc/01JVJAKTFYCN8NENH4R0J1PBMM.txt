Mary Stuart, often called Mary, Queen of Scots, had a truly dramatic life, and it all started incredibly early. Her father, King James V of Scotland, died unexpectedly in 1542, leaving the throne vacant. Now, here's the key: Mary was his only surviving legitimate child. Because she was the direct heir, the crown passed to her immediately. The thing that makes this so remarkable is her age at the time. James V died just six days after Mary was born. That means Mary Stuart became Queen of Scotland when she was only one week old! Obviously, she didn't actually *rule* at that age; Scotland was governed by regents until she was old enough. But legally, she was the Queen from that incredibly young age. It's easy to get confused and think she was older, but the fact that she inherited the throne so soon after her birth is a crucial part of her story and Scottish history.
