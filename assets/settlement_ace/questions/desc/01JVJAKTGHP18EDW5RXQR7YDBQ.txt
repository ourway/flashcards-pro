The Children's Hearings system is a unique aspect of the Scottish legal and social care landscape, designed to support vulnerable children and young people. Unlike other parts of the UK, Scotland has a distinct legal system rooted in its history as a separate kingdom. This system prioritizes the wellbeing of children in need of care or protection, or those who have committed offences. Instead of traditional court proceedings, Children's Hearings bring together a panel of trained lay volunteers, the child (where appropriate), their family, and relevant professionals like social workers and teachers. The goal is to make decisions that are in the child's best interests, focusing on support and rehabilitation rather than punishment. This approach reflects Scotland's commitment to a welfare-based model of juvenile justice. While England, Wales, and Northern Ireland have their own systems for dealing with child welfare and youth offending, the Children's Hearings system is exclusively used in Scotland, making it a key feature of their approach to child care.
