The English Civil War, a pivotal period in British history, raged from 1642 to 1651. It was essentially a power struggle between those who supported King Charles I and those who supported Parliament. This conflict wasn't just about who ruled, but also about religious freedom and how the country should be governed. Marston Moor, fought in 1644 near York, was one of the largest and most significant battles of this war. The Parliamentarians, including Oliver Cromwell's forces, decisively defeated the Royalist army. This victory was crucial for the Parliamentarians, giving them control of the north of England. Now, Waterloo was a famous battle, but it was fought in 1815 against Napoleon, long after the Civil War. Hastings, of course, was the iconic battle in 1066 that saw William the Conqueror take the English throne, centuries before the English Civil War even began. So, Marston Moor is the correct answer because it directly relates to the battles fought during the English Civil War.
