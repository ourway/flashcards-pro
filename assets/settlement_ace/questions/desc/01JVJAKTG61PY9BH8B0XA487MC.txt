Admiral Nelson's story is central to British naval history, and the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 is his most famous, albeit tragic, victory. Britain was at war with France, led by Napoleon, who planned to invade Britain. Nelson, as commander of the British fleet, intercepted the French and Spanish navies off the coast of Spain at Trafalgar. The British decisively defeated the combined fleet, preventing Napoleon's planned invasion of Britain. However, during the battle, Nelson was fatally shot by a French sniper. So, while the battle was a resounding victory that secured British naval dominance for over a century, it's also remembered for the death of one of Britain's greatest heroes. The other options are incorrect because the Crimean War was a later conflict in the 19th century, the Glorious First of June was another naval battle but not associated with Nelson's death, and the Battle of Waterloo was a land battle where Napoleon was finally defeated, but Nelson wasn't involved.
