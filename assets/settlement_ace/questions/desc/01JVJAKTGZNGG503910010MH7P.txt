Okay, let's talk about the Scottish Parliament building. To understand why it's at Holyrood, we need a little Scottish history. Scotland has a long and proud history of self-governance. After being part of Great Britain, there was a growing desire for more autonomy. This led to a referendum in 1997 where the Scottish people voted in favour of establishing their own parliament. The Scottish Parliament was officially established in 1999. Now, where to put it? They chose Holyrood in Edinburgh. Holyrood is a historically significant area, home to Holyrood Palace, the Queen's official residence in Scotland. Placing the parliament there symbolized a new chapter while respecting Scotland's rich heritage. So, while Stormont is the seat of the Northern Ireland Assembly, Westminster is where the UK Parliament sits, and the Senedd is the Welsh Parliament, Holyrood is specifically where you'll find the Scottish Parliament building.
