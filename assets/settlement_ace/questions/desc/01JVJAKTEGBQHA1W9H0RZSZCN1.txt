The Crimean War, fought from 1854 to 1856, was a pretty significant conflict involving several major European powers. Think of it as a 19th-century showdown over influence in the Ottoman Empire, which was weakening at the time. Russia, seeking to expand its power, particularly its access to the Black Sea, clashed with the Ottoman Empire. Britain and France, worried about Russia becoming too dominant and disrupting the balance of power in Europe, stepped in to support the Ottomans. So, while Turkey (then the Ottoman Empire) was actually an ally of Britain in this war, the main opponent was Russia. India, at that time, was under British rule and not a participant in the war itself. France was actually on the same side as Britain. The Crimean War is also known for Florence Nightingale's pioneering work in nursing, which significantly improved medical care for British soldiers during the conflict.
