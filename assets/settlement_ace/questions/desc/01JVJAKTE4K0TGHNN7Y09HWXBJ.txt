The 2012 Paralympic Games were a huge event for the UK, and London was chosen as the host city. Now, you might be thinking, "Why London?" Well, London had already successfully bid for and hosted the 2012 Olympic Games, so it made sense to leverage the existing infrastructure and planning for the Paralympics as well. Think of it as a double celebration! Hosting both events back-to-back allowed for a more efficient use of resources and a continued buzz of excitement throughout the summer. The Games themselves are a major international competition for athletes with disabilities, and they follow directly after the Olympic Games, using the same venues. This helps to promote inclusivity and raise awareness of disability sports. While other cities like Birmingham, Bradford, and Manchester are important in the UK, they simply weren't the host cities for this particular global event. So, when you think of the 2012 Paralympics, remember the iconic venues and the incredible athletes who competed in London.
