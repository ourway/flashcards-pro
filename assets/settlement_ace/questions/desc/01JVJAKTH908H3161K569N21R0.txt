The English Civil War was a really pivotal period in British history, a clash between those who supported King Charles I and those who supported Parliament. Think of it as a battle over power and how the country should be governed. The King believed in the 'divine right of kings', meaning he thought God had given him the right to rule absolutely. Parliament, on the other hand, wanted more say in how the country was run, especially when it came to things like raising taxes. Tensions had been building for years, but things finally came to a head in 1642. This was the year that Charles I raised his standard in Nottingham, effectively declaring war on Parliament. While there were earlier skirmishes and political disagreements in 1640 and 1641, 1642 is the year that marks the official start of the full-blown English Civil War. 1646 is incorrect because that's when the first phase of the war ended with the King's defeat. So, remember 1642 as the year the fighting really kicked off!
