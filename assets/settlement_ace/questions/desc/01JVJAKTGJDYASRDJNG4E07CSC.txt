Sake Dean Mahomet was a truly fascinating figure who played a pivotal role in introducing aspects of Indian culture to Britain. During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, there was growing interest in the exotic goods and customs of the East, but direct exposure was still limited for most Britons. Mahomet seized this opportunity. While tea was already becoming popular, it was not Mahomet's contribution. Instead, he opened what is considered to be one of the first Indian restaurants in London, offering Britons a taste of authentic Indian cuisine, including curries. More than that, he also established a popular bathhouse where he offered "shampooing" â€“ a treatment involving massage and herbal oils, quite different from the hair washing we know today. This introduced a novel form of relaxation and hygiene to British society. So, while bungalows and tea are associated with India and Britain, Mahomet's specific claim to fame lies in popularizing curry houses and shampooing.
