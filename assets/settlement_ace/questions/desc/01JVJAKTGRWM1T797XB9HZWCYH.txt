The Scottish Parliament, officially opened in 1999, is a key part of the UK's devolved government system. Devolution is when the central government gives some power to governments in other parts of the country. The Scottish Parliament was created to give the Scottish people more say in how their country is run, dealing with things like health, education, and some aspects of law and order. Now, when it comes to the number of people sitting in the Scottish Parliament, we're talking about 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament, or MSPs. These MSPs are elected to represent different areas of Scotland. It's a bit like the UK Parliament, but specifically for Scotland. So, while other numbers might sound plausible, 129 is the specific number of elected members who make up the Scottish Parliament and make decisions on behalf of the Scottish people.
