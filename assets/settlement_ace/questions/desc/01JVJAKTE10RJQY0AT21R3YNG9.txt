Stonehenge, that iconic prehistoric monument, is located in Wiltshire, a county in southwest England. Think of Wiltshire as a place steeped in ancient history; it's practically synonymous with Stonehenge. The monument itself is a ring of standing stones, believed to have been constructed from around 3000 BC to 2000 BC. It's not just *near* Wiltshire; it's *in* Wiltshire, specifically on Salisbury Plain. Now, you might be thinking of other counties with historical significance, like Berkshire or Hampshire, which are also in southern England, but they don't house Stonehenge. Yorkshire, on the other hand, is way up north and known for its own unique history and landscapes, but definitely not Stonehenge. So, when you picture Stonehenge, picture the rolling hills of Wiltshire.
