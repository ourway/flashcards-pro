Okay, so think about why dogs wear collars in the UK. It's not just for fashion! Legally, dogs in public places must wear a collar with the owner's name and address on it. This law is in place to help reunite lost dogs with their owners quickly and efficiently. Imagine your furry friend gets spooked and runs off â€“ a clear, visible tag with your details is the fastest way for someone to contact you. While it might seem cute to put your dog's name or breed on the collar, that information isn't legally required and doesn't help with immediate identification of the owner. Microchipping is also important, but a collar is the first thing someone will look for. So, the owner's name and address are the two crucial details that should be displayed, ensuring a swift reunion if your dog ever decides to go on an unscheduled adventure.
