Boudicca's story is one of fierce resistance against Roman occupation in the 1st century AD. The Romans, having invaded Britain in 43 AD under Emperor Claudius, quickly began establishing their rule, building roads, forts, and towns. They demanded taxes and often treated the native Celtic tribes harshly. Boudicca was the queen of the Iceni tribe, located in what is now Norfolk. When her husband died, the Romans seized his lands and wealth, and according to some accounts, publicly flogged Boudicca and assaulted her daughters. This sparked a major revolt in 60 or 61 AD. Boudicca led her people and other tribes in a bloody uprising, destroying Roman settlements like Colchester, London, and Verulamium (modern-day St Albans). While the revolt was initially successful, the Romans eventually crushed the rebellion, and Boudicca either died in battle or took her own life to avoid capture. The other options – Normans, Vikings, and Anglo-Saxons – all arrived in Britain much later, centuries after Boudicca's time. The Normans came in 1066, the Vikings raided from the 8th century onwards, and the Anglo-Saxons began settling in the 5th century.
