The Queen's Speech is a really important event in the UK's political calendar, marking the formal start of the parliamentary year. Think of it like the government's opening statement. The UK operates under a constitutional monarchy, meaning the Queen is Head of State, but she acts on the advice of the elected government. The speech itself is actually written by the government, specifically the Prime Minister and their cabinet. The Queen then reads this speech aloud in the House of Lords. The key thing to remember is that the speech outlines the government's proposed policies and laws for the upcoming year. It's essentially a preview of the bills they intend to introduce and pass through Parliament. While the Queen is delivering it, she isn't expressing her own personal opinions or giving advice. It's purely a statement of the government's agenda. So, the purpose is to set out the government's legislative plans for the next year.
