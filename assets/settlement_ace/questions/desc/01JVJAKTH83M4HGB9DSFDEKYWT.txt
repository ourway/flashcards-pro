Good Friday is a really important day in the Christian calendar, marking the day that Jesus Christ was crucified. To understand why it's called "Good" Friday, even though it commemorates such a sad event, you have to remember that Christians believe Jesus' death was a sacrifice that paved the way for humanity's salvation. It falls on the Friday before Easter Sunday, which is the day Christians celebrate Jesus' resurrection. Easter is a movable feast, meaning its date changes each year based on the lunar calendar, so Good Friday changes too. Now, Easter Sunday celebrates the resurrection, so it's a day of joy, not mourning. Shrove Tuesday, also known as Pancake Day, is the day before Lent begins, a time of reflection and fasting. Ash Wednesday marks the start of Lent. So, while all these days are related to the Christian faith, only Good Friday specifically commemorates the death of Jesus.
