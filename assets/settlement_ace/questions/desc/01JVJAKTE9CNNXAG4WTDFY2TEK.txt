Isaac Newton is one of the most important figures in the history of science, but music wasn't really his thing. He lived from 1643 to 1727, so he was around during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. He's famous for his laws of motion and universal gravitation â€“ that's the apple falling from the tree story! Newton also made major contributions to optics and calculus. While the 18th century did see a flourishing of musical talent, think of composers like Bach and Handel, Newton was busy with physics and mathematics. So, while he was a genius, his genius lay in science, not sonatas. It's easy to get historical figures mixed up, but remembering the apple and gravity will help you connect Newton to science, not music.
