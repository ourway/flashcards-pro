The Church of Scotland's identity is deeply intertwined with Scottish history and the Reformation. Unlike England, which has the Church of England with the monarch as its head, Scotland underwent its own Reformation in the 16th century, leading to the establishment of a Presbyterian church. Presbyterianism emphasizes governance by elders, or "presbyters," elected from the congregation, rather than bishops appointed by a monarch. This system reflects a more democratic approach to church leadership. Think of figures like John Knox, a key leader in the Scottish Reformation, who championed this Presbyterian model. So, while other denominations like Catholic, Baptist, or Methodist exist in Scotland, the Church of Scotland's official structure and historical roots firmly place it within the Presbyterian tradition. This difference in church governance was a major point of contention between Scotland and England for centuries, shaping Scottish identity and its relationship with the rest of the UK.
