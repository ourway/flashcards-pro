Cornwall, located in the southwest of England, is known for its stunning coastline, unique landscapes, and mild climate. This makes it an ideal location for a project like the Eden Project, which relies on a specific environment to thrive. The Eden Project itself is a massive conservation project featuring two enormous biomes housing plants collected from diverse climates and environments around the world. It was built in a reclaimed china clay pit, demonstrating how industrial sites can be transformed into something beautiful and beneficial. Dorset, while also in the southwest, doesn't have the same specific combination of climate and available space that made Cornwall the perfect choice. London is a major urban center, and Liverpool is a northern port city; neither offers the geographical or environmental characteristics suited for such a large-scale botanical undertaking. So, the Eden Project's location in Cornwall is intrinsically linked to the region's unique geography and environmental advantages.
