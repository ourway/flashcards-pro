Father's Day, celebrated annually on the third Sunday in June, is a relatively modern tradition dedicated to honouring fathers and father figures. While the concept of celebrating fatherhood has existed in various forms throughout history, the Father's Day we know today originated in the United States in the early 20th century. Sonora Smart Dodd, inspired by Mother's Day celebrations, campaigned for a day to recognize the contributions of fathers, particularly her own, a Civil War veteran who raised six children as a single parent. The first Father's Day was celebrated in Spokane, Washington, in 1910. Over time, the holiday gained popularity and was eventually recognized nationally in the US. The tradition then spread to other countries, including the UK, where it's now a widely observed day for families to show appreciation for their fathers through gifts, cards, and quality time. Remembrance Day is in November, Mother's Day is in March, and Halloween is in October, so none of those are in June.
