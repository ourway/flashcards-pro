The UK's population growth has indeed sped up in recent years, and it's important to understand why. Historically, population growth was much slower, influenced by factors like disease, famine, and lower life expectancy. However, advances in healthcare, sanitation, and living standards have dramatically increased how long people live. This means fewer deaths and more people living longer. On top of that, immigration has played a significant role. The UK has become an attractive destination for people from all over the world seeking better opportunities, education, or refuge. This influx of people adds directly to the population. So, when you combine increased life expectancy with a steady stream of immigrants, you get a faster rate of population growth than in previous eras. While it might seem like the population has always been growing rapidly, the recent acceleration is a relatively new phenomenon tied to these specific factors.
