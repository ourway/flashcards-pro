Okay, let's talk about the House of Commons in the Middle Ages. Back then, England's parliament was evolving, and it wasn't quite the representative body we know today. The House of Commons was specifically intended to represent the "common" people, but who exactly were they? Well, it certainly wasn't the nobility or the great landowners; they had their own space in the House of Lords. Bishops, as leaders of the Church, also held significant power and influence, but they were also part of the House of Lords. Instead, the House of Commons was primarily made up of knights and wealthy townsmen. Knights, often landowners themselves but of a lesser status than the great lords, were elected to represent their local communities. They were seen as representatives of their shires, bringing local concerns to the attention of the King and his advisors. So, while the House of Commons wasn't exactly a gathering of ordinary peasants, it was the knights who formed its core membership, acting as a bridge between the monarchy and the wider population.
