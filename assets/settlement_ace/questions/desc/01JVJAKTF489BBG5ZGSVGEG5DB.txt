The small claims procedure is designed to be a more accessible and less intimidating way for people to resolve minor disputes, usually involving amounts under Â£10,000 in England and Wales, and slightly less in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Think of it as a streamlined version of going to court. To keep costs down and make it easier for everyone, the hearings are deliberately informal. Instead of a grand courtroom setting, they often take place in a regular room, sometimes even an office. The judge, who might be called a "district judge," will usually sit at a table with the people involved in the dispute. This setup helps create a more relaxed atmosphere where people feel more comfortable explaining their side of the story. It's all about making the legal process less daunting and more approachable for everyday citizens. So, the statement is true because the small claims procedure aims for informality and accessibility, reflected in the hearing environment.
