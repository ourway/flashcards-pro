Okay, let's talk about the legal drinking age in the UK, which can be a bit confusing. The general rule is that you must be 18 to buy or consume alcohol in a pub, restaurant, or shop. However, there's an exception carved out for young people aged 16 or 17. The law recognizes that within a supervised setting, like a restaurant meal with family, a young person can responsibly consume alcohol. Specifically, a 16 or 17-year-old can drink beer, cider, or wine with a meal if they are accompanied by an adult â€“ someone over the age of 18. This exception acknowledges that families often introduce alcohol in a controlled environment. It's important to remember that this exception only applies to beer, cider, or wine consumed with a meal, and it requires the presence of an adult. It's also illegal to buy alcohol for someone under 18, with limited exceptions. So, while 18 is the standard drinking age, 16 is the minimum age when these specific conditions are met.
