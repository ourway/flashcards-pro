Okay, let's explore the historical context of English colonization in America. The key period we're talking about is the late 16th century. While figures like Henry VIII are significant in English history, his reign was earlier, primarily focused on domestic matters like the English Reformation. Queen Victoria, on the other hand, reigned much later, in the 19th century, long after the initial colonization efforts. Charles II reigned in the later 17th century, after the initial colonies were established.

Now, think about the first English attempts to establish colonies in North America. These ventures, like the Roanoke colony, occurred during the reign of Elizabeth I. She ruled from 1558 to 1603, a period marked by exploration, maritime expansion, and the beginnings of England's overseas empire. While Roanoke ultimately failed, it represents the pioneering spirit of the Elizabethan era and the first tangible efforts to create a permanent English presence in what would become the United States. Therefore, Elizabeth I is the monarch reigning when English settlers first began colonizing the eastern coast of America.
