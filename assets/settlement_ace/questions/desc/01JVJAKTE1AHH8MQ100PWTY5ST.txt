The early 20th century was a time of significant social change in Britain, and one of the most prominent movements was the fight for women's suffrage, the right to vote. While many groups advocated for social reform, the Suffragettes are specifically remembered for their direct and often militant actions to achieve voting rights for women. The name "Suffragette" itself, coined by the Daily Mail as a derogatory term, became a badge of honor for members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), founded by Emmeline Pankhurst in 1903. Their tactics, which included protests, civil disobedience, and even hunger strikes, brought the issue of women's suffrage to the forefront of British politics. The other options, while important in British history, were not primarily focused on women's rights. The Chartists, for example, were a working-class movement advocating for political reforms in the 19th century, but their focus was broader than just women's suffrage. The Suffragettes, therefore, are the group most directly associated with pioneering the campaign for women's rights, particularly the right to vote.
