Alright, let's talk about Bonnie Prince Charlie and the 1745 Jacobite rising. To understand this, you need to know a bit about the Stuart dynasty. They used to be the Kings and Queens of Scotland and England, but they were replaced by the Hanoverians. Many people, especially in the Scottish Highlands, still supported the Stuarts and wanted them back on the throne. Charles Edward Stuart, nicknamed "Bonnie Prince Charlie," was the Stuart claimant at the time. In 1745, he landed in Scotland hoping to regain the throne for his father. He successfully rallied many Highland clans to his cause, forming an army that initially saw some victories. So, when you hear about someone raising an army with the support of Scottish Highland clansmen in 1745, Bonnie Prince Charlie is the historical figure that fits perfectly. Robert the Bruce was a much earlier Scottish king, Oliver Cromwell was an English leader from a different period, and Kenneth MacAlpin was one of the first Kings of Scots way back in the 9th century.
