Okay, let's talk about the Reformation. To understand it, we need to rewind to the 16th century and the reign of King Henry VIII. Before this time, the Catholic Church held immense power and influence in England. Henry, however, wanted to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, because she hadn't produced a male heir. The Pope refused to grant him an annulment. This led to a major clash. Henry, determined to get his way, initiated a series of actions that ultimately broke England away from the authority of the Pope and the Catholic Church. This period of religious upheaval and change is known as the Reformation. He declared himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England, allowing him to grant his own divorce. So, the Reformation specifically refers to this 16th-century movement that challenged papal authority and Catholic doctrines during Henry VIII's reign. The other options, like the Enlightenment, the Glorious Revolution, and the Renaissance, were important periods of change, but they occurred at different times and focused on different aspects of society, such as reason, political power, and artistic expression, respectively.
