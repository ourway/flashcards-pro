Okay, let's explore the origins of the British Parliament. Back in the day, ruling a country was a tough job, even for a king! Think of it like this: a king needed advice and support to make important decisions. So, he would gather a group of trusted individuals – nobles, church officials, and other important figures – to form a council. This council was essentially the precursor to Parliament. Over time, this group evolved, gaining more power and influence. It wasn't the Church's system or a council solely for noblemen or knights, although those groups were often represented. The key is that it started as the King's way of getting counsel. This council gradually developed into what we now know as Parliament, a body that represents the people and holds the government accountable. So, remembering that the King's need for advisors was the seed from which Parliament grew helps to understand its historical roots.
