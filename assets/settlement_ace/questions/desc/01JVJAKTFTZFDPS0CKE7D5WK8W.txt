The Proms, short for the Promenade Concerts, are a classical music festival held every summer in London. Think of it as the world's biggest and most democratic classical music festival. It was founded in 1895 by Robert Newman and Sir Henry Wood with the goal of bringing classical music to a wider audience. A key feature is the "promenading" area, where people can stand (or sit on the floor) for a much cheaper ticket price, creating a more relaxed and accessible atmosphere. The vast majority of the Proms concerts are held in the Royal Albert Hall, a stunning Victorian building. The season culminates in the "Last Night of the Proms," a boisterous celebration of British identity and classical music, complete with flag-waving and sing-alongs. The other options, T in the Park, Creamfields, and Glastonbury, are all popular music festivals, but they focus on rock, pop, dance, and other contemporary genres, not classical music.
