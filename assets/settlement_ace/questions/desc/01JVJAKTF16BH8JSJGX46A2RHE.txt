The annual rowing race between Oxford and Cambridge Universities is a quintessential British tradition steeped in history. It began in 1829, making it one of the oldest and most famous amateur sporting events in the world. The race sees two eight-oared crews, one from each university, compete head-to-head on a four-and-a-quarter-mile stretch of the River Thames in West London. The rivalry is intense, and the event draws huge crowds along the riverbanks and is broadcast globally. Now, while both universities undoubtedly participate in football, basketball, and tennis, these aren't the sports associated with this specific, historic annual competition between them. The rowing race, with its long-standing tradition and iconic status, is the correct answer because it's the only sporting event that has been consistently held annually between Oxford and Cambridge for nearly two centuries.
