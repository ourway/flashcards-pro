Okay, let's tackle the idea of the King James Bible being the first English Bible. It's a common misconception, but the King James Version, while incredibly influential, wasn't the first. Think of it more like a really popular remix of an existing song. The first complete English Bible was actually translated by Miles Coverdale in 1535. Before that, parts of the Bible had been translated into English, notably by John Wycliffe in the late 14th century, but these weren't complete versions and were often circulated in manuscript form. The King James Version, also known as the Authorized Version, came much later, in 1611, during the reign of King James I. It was commissioned to create a more standardized and authoritative English Bible, drawing on previous translations. So, while the King James Version is hugely significant in English literature and culture, it built upon earlier efforts to make the Bible accessible in English. That's why the statement is false; it's a later, revised edition, not the original.
