The Proms, short for the Promenade Concerts, is a classical music festival held every summer in London. Its full name is actually the BBC Proms, because the BBC has run it since 1927. The Proms were originally started in 1895 by Robert Newman and Henry Wood, with the aim of bringing classical music to a wider audience. The name "Promenade Concerts" comes from the fact that in the early days, people could walk around or promenade during the concert, especially in the gallery. Today, while there's still some standing room, it's more of a traditional concert experience. The Proms are a really big deal, featuring daily orchestral concerts and other events throughout the season, showcasing a wide range of classical music. This summer season of orchestral classical music lasts for eight weeks, making it a significant and much-anticipated cultural event in the UK. So, while three, four, or six weeks might seem like a reasonable length for a festival, The Proms are much grander in scale and run for a full eight weeks.
