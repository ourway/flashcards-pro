The rules of succession to the British throne are determined by lineage and, since 2013, gender is no longer a factor for those born after October 28, 2011. Historically, the throne passed to the monarch's eldest son, a system known as male primogeniture. While that has changed to absolute primogeniture, where the eldest child, regardless of gender, is first in line, the principle of direct descent remains paramount. The current monarch's eldest son is therefore the immediate successor. While Prince William is also in line for the throne, he is the heir to his father, not the current Queen. The Prime Minister holds a powerful political position but has no claim to the throne. The Queen's husband, while a significant figure, is not in the line of succession because succession is based on bloodline, not marriage.
