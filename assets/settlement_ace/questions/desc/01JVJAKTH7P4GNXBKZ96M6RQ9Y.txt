Sikhism, originating in the Punjab region of India in the 15th century, is a relatively small but significant religion in the UK. While Hinduism and Islam have larger followings due to historical immigration patterns, Sikhism's presence is notable, particularly within certain communities. The first Sikhs arrived in Britain in small numbers during the Victorian era, but larger-scale immigration occurred after World War II, especially from the 1950s onwards. Today, the Sikh community is well-integrated and contributes significantly to British society. Although visible through their distinctive turbans and beards (for men) and their community engagement, Sikhs constitute approximately 1% of the total UK population. The other percentages listed are incorrect because they overestimate the actual proportion of Sikhs in the UK. While Sikhism is a growing religion, it doesn't yet represent a larger percentage of the population.
