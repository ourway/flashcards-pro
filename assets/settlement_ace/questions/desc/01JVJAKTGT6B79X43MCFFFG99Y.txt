The National Assembly for Wales, now known as the Welsh Parliament or Senedd Cymru, is the democratically elected body responsible for making laws and representing the interests of Wales. It was established in 1999 following a referendum in 1997, marking a significant step in the devolution of power from the UK Parliament. Unlike the UK Parliament, which has a House of Commons and a House of Lords, the Senedd is unicameral, meaning it has only one chamber. The key thing to remember is the number of members. The Senedd is made up of 60 members, known as Members of the Senedd, or MSs. These members are elected to represent specific constituencies and regions across Wales. So, the statement that there are 160 members is incorrect. It's easy to get confused with the UK Parliament's House of Commons, which has significantly more MPs, but always remember the Senedd has 60 MSs.
