Friends of the Earth is all about protecting our planet. They're an environmental charity, and that means their main focus is on looking after the Earth â€“ its ecosystems, wildlife, and natural resources. Environmental charities like Friends of the Earth work on a whole range of issues, from campaigning against pollution and climate change to protecting endangered species and promoting sustainable living. They might lobby the government to introduce stricter environmental regulations, or work with local communities to clean up polluted areas. The name itself, "Friends of the Earth," is a big clue! It clearly signals their commitment to environmental causes. While medical research, animal welfare, and support for the elderly are all very important causes, they simply don't fall under the specific remit of an *environmental* charity.
