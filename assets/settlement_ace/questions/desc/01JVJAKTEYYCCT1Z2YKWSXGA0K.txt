The fight for women's suffrage in the UK was a long and hard-won battle. While many associate the suffragette movement with the early 20th century, the seeds were sown much earlier. The suffragettes, led by Emmeline Pankhurst, used more direct and sometimes militant tactics to gain attention. Before 1918, no women could vote. The Representation of the People Act in 1918 was a landmark achievement, granting the vote to women over 30 who met certain property qualifications. This was partly a reward for women's contributions to the war effort. However, it wasn't full equality. It wasn't until ten years later, in 1928, with the passing of the Representation of the People Act, that women finally achieved equal voting rights with men. This act lowered the voting age for women to 21, the same as men. So, while 1918 was a significant step, 1928 is the year to remember for complete equality at the ballot box. It's easy to think women got the vote at 18, like today, but that's a much more recent change.
