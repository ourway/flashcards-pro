St. George's Day, celebrated on April 23rd, is England's national day. St. George is the patron saint of England, and while his story is shrouded in legend, he's believed to have been a Roman soldier who was executed for refusing to renounce his Christian faith. The association with England began much later, around the 14th century, when he became a popular figure among knights and royalty. He was adopted as the patron saint of England, embodying ideals of bravery, honour, and chivalry. While St. George's Day isn't a public holiday like St. Andrew's Day in Scotland or St. Patrick's Day in Northern Ireland, it's still a day to celebrate English culture and identity. You might see St. George's flag, a red cross on a white background, displayed on buildings and in towns. The other dates listed are associated with other patron saints: St. Andrew's Day is on November 30th, and St. Patrick's Day is on March 17th. St. David's Day, the patron saint of Wales, is celebrated on March 1st.
