The Middle Ages in Britain spanned roughly from the 5th century, after the Roman withdrawal, to the late 15th century, concluding around the end of the Wars of the Roses. During this time, castles and fortified structures were common, reflecting the need for defense and the power of the monarchy and nobility. The White Tower, a central building within the Tower of London, perfectly embodies this era. Construction began in the late 11th century, around 1078, under William the Conqueror, as a symbol of Norman power and control after the Norman Conquest of 1066. It served as a royal residence, armoury, and prison throughout its history. The other options are much more recent. The London Eye is a modern Ferris wheel built in the late 20th century. The Queen's House in Greenwich dates back to the early 17th century, placing it firmly in the Renaissance period. The O2 arena is a 21st-century entertainment venue. Therefore, the White Tower is the only structure on the list that originated and served a significant purpose during the Middle Ages.
