General Elections in the UK are a cornerstone of its democratic system, and understanding their frequency is key. The reason a General Election doesn't happen every eight years is because the law dictates a maximum term of five years for a Parliament. This five-year limit is set by the Parliament Act of 1911, later amended, and ensures that the government remains accountable to the people. While elections *can* be called earlier than five years, they cannot be held later than this. Think of it like this: the government has a five-year lease on power, and at the end of that lease, they have to ask the public to renew it. So, while it might be tempting to think governments could stretch their time in office, the five-year rule keeps the system fair and responsive to the electorate. It's also worth remembering that historically, before these Acts, Parliaments could last much longer, sometimes leading to periods where public opinion wasn't accurately reflected.
