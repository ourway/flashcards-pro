Joseph Mallord William Turner, often just called Turner, was a hugely influential British artist, especially during the Romantic period of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Now, while he experimented with different subjects, he's overwhelmingly known for his landscapes. But these weren't just any landscapes! Turner was fascinated by light and atmosphere, and he used his paintings to capture the drama and power of nature. Think swirling storms, dramatic sunsets, and misty mornings. He was a master of using colour to evoke emotion and create a sense of awe. So, while other artists of the time might have focused on portraits of important people or historical scenes, Turner was all about the natural world. That's why "landscape" is the answer that best describes his most famous and influential work. It's easy to remember if you picture one of his iconic paintings of the sea, sky, or countryside â€“ those are the images that cemented his place in art history.
