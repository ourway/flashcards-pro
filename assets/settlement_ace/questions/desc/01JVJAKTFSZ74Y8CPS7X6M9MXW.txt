The Domesday Book is really all about control and taxation. Think about it: William the Conqueror had just taken over England in 1066 after the Battle of Hastings. He and his Norman lords needed to know exactly what they now owned â€“ who lived where, what land was available, what resources existed, and how much tax they could collect. So, in 1086, William commissioned a massive survey of England. This survey became the Domesday Book, a detailed record of land, property, and people. It's an invaluable historical document, giving us a snapshot of England at that time. The other options are incorrect because while the Vikings, Romans, and Anglo-Saxons certainly invaded and influenced Britain, none of them created such a comprehensive record of the land after their conquests. The Domesday Book is specifically linked to the Norman takeover and William's need to consolidate his power.
