Stonehenge, that mysterious circle of standing stones in Wiltshire, has puzzled historians and archaeologists for centuries. While we don't know everything about its purpose for sure, the most widely accepted theory revolves around seasonal ceremonies. Think about it: Stonehenge was built over a very long period, starting around 3000 BC. Its construction aligns with astronomical events, particularly the solstices. The way the stones are positioned suggests they were used to mark the passage of the sun, especially during the summer and winter solstices, which were hugely important in agricultural societies. These events would have been crucial for planning planting and harvests. So, it's highly likely that Stonehenge served as a gathering place for rituals and celebrations tied to these seasonal changes. The other options, like a shelter or fort, don't really fit with the evidence. It wasn't built for defense, and it wouldn't have provided much protection from the elements. The sheer effort involved in building Stonehenge points to a more significant, ceremonial purpose.
