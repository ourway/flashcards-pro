Before the Magna Carta in 1215, it might seem like the king had unlimited power, but that wasn't quite the case. Even though the Magna Carta is a landmark document that significantly limited royal authority, earlier laws and customs did exist that acted as checks on the monarch. Think of it less as a sudden revolution in 1215 and more as a gradual evolution. For example, Anglo-Saxon law, which predates the Norman Conquest of 1066, included established customs and legal principles that even the king was expected to respect. These weren't always written down in a single document like the Magna Carta, but they were understood and enforced through local courts and traditions. So, while the Magna Carta was a pivotal moment, it built upon a foundation of existing legal constraints, making it true that laws existed before 1215 to curtail the power of the English king. It's easy to think the Magna Carta was the very first limit on royal power, but it was more of a formal, written confirmation of limits that were already developing.
