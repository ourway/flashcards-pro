Royal coronations are grand affairs steeped in tradition, and music plays a vital role in setting the tone and reflecting the solemnity of the occasion. While composers like Handel and Purcell wrote magnificent music for past monarchs, they lived long before George VI and Elizabeth II. Handel, for example, composed "Zadok the Priest" for George II's coronation in 1727, and it's been used at every coronation since! Elgar, famous for "Pomp and Circumstance," died in 1934, before either of these coronations took place. Sir William Walton, on the other hand, was a prominent 20th-century British composer. He was commissioned to write the music for George VI's coronation in 1937 and then again for Queen Elizabeth II's in 1953. This makes him the correct answer, as he was the composer specifically tasked with creating music for these two significant royal events.
