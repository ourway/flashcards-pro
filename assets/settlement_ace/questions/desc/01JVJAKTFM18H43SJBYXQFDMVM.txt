Florence Nightingale, often called the "Lady with the Lamp," is synonymous with modern nursing. To understand why "nurse" is the right answer, think about her historical impact. During the Crimean War in the 1850s, conditions in British military hospitals were appalling. Nightingale, with a team of nurses, dramatically improved hygiene and patient care. She implemented practices like hand-washing and proper sanitation, which significantly reduced mortality rates. Her work wasn't just about bedside care; she was a pioneer in statistical analysis, using data to demonstrate the link between sanitation and health outcomes. She later founded the Nightingale Training School at St Thomas' Hospital in London, establishing nursing as a respected profession. While she was a strong leader and advocate, and perhaps enjoyed gardening, her lasting legacy and primary profession was definitively nursing.
