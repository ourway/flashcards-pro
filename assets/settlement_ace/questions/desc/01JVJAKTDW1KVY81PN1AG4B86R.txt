The House of Lords, unlike the House of Commons, operates on a different principle of selection. Think of it this way: the House of Commons is all about representing the people directly through elections. But the House of Lords has historically been about representing other interests and expertise. Its origins lie in a time when nobility and the Church held significant power. Over centuries, its composition has evolved, but the core principle remains that members are not directly elected by the public. Most members are appointed, often for life, based on their achievements or expertise in various fields. Some are hereditary peers, although their numbers have been significantly reduced. And senior bishops of the Church of England also have seats. So, while the idea of voting might seem like the default way to choose representatives in a democracy, the House of Lords is a deliberate exception to that rule, designed to bring a different perspective to the UK Parliament.
