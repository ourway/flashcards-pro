National Days in the UK celebrate the patron saints of each country, and their order in the calendar reflects the dates traditionally associated with those saints. St David's Day, celebrating the patron saint of Wales, falls on March 1st. Next up is St Patrick's Day on March 17th, honouring the patron saint of Ireland. Then comes St George's Day, April 23rd, for England's patron saint. Finally, St Andrew's Day, celebrating the patron saint of Scotland, is on November 30th. So, the correct order follows the calendar year, starting in early spring and ending in late autumn. It's easy to remember with the mnemonic: 'David, Patrick, George, Andrew' - Dashing Patriots Greatly Admired. While all these saints are important figures in British and Irish culture, their feast days are spread throughout the year, making this chronological order the only correct one.
