The Highland Clearances were a tragic period in Scottish history, primarily during the 18th and 19th centuries. Landlords, often motivated by economic gain, forcibly evicted tenants from their ancestral lands in the Scottish Highlands. The reason? Sheep farming became far more profitable than traditional agriculture. Landlords wanted to convert the land into large sheep farms, which required far fewer people. This led to the systematic displacement of entire communities. People were forced off their land, often with little or no compensation, and many emigrated to other parts of Britain, or overseas to places like Canada and America, in search of a new life. So, when you hear about Scottish landlords clearing small farms for sheep and cattle, the term that specifically describes this process is the Highland Clearances. While "feudalism" relates to land ownership, it doesn't capture the specific act of eviction. "Pocket Boroughs" were about electoral corruption, and the "rebellion of the landlords" is too vague and doesn't accurately describe the clearances themselves.
