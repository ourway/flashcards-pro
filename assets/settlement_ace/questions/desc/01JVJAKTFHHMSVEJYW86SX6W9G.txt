Okay, let's talk about Prime Minister's Questions, often called PMQs. This is a really important part of how the UK government is held accountable. Think of it as a weekly grilling session for the Prime Minister. It happens every Wednesday when Parliament is sitting. During PMQs, Members of Parliament, especially the Leader of the Opposition, get to directly question the Prime Minister on any topic they choose. It's a chance to challenge government policy, raise important issues, and generally keep the Prime Minister on their toes. The tradition dates back to the 19th century, though it wasn't formalized as a weekly event until the 1960s. So, while you might think the Prime Minister faces questions every day – which they do in other settings – or that this intense scrutiny only happens monthly or annually, PMQs is specifically a weekly event, providing regular accountability. It's a key feature of the UK's parliamentary system.
