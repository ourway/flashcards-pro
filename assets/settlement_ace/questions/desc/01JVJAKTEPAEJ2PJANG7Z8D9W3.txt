Geoffrey Chaucer, often called the "father of English literature," lived in the 14th century, a pivotal time for the English language as it transitioned from Anglo-Norman influences. His most famous work, *The Canterbury Tales*, is a collection of stories told by a diverse group of pilgrims on their way to Canterbury Cathedral, a significant religious site. Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was murdered there in 1170, making it a popular pilgrimage destination. Chaucer began writing *The Canterbury Tales* around 1387, and he continued working on it until his death in 1400. So, the correct answer is in the years leading up to 1400 because that's when Chaucer was actively composing this iconic series of poems. While pilgrimages were common throughout the medieval period, Chaucer's detailed and humorous portrayal of English society at the end of the 14th century makes this timeframe specifically relevant to his work.
