Gertrude Jekyll and Edwin Lutyens were a famous and influential design partnership in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Gertrude Jekyll was a hugely important garden designer, known for her painterly approach to planting and her use of colour. She designed over 400 gardens in the UK, Europe, and the US, and her designs were very influential. Edwin Lutyens, on the other hand, was a renowned architect, famous for designing grand country houses. The two often collaborated, with Lutyens designing the architectural elements of the garden, like walls and terraces, and Jekyll creating the planting schemes. Their partnership created some of the most beautiful and iconic gardens in Britain. While Dylan Thomas was a famous Welsh poet and Sir Christopher Cockerell invented the hovercraft, neither were garden designers, making them incorrect answers.
