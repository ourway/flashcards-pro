Okay, let's break down the question about the non-religious population in the UK. Religion has played a significant role in British history and culture, but in recent decades, there's been a noticeable shift in how people identify. While the Church of England remains the established church, meaning it has a formal connection to the state, a growing number of people don't actively practice any religion. This trend reflects broader social changes, including increasing secularization and individual choice in matters of belief. Now, when we look at the numbers, around 21% of the UK population identifies as having no religion. This figure is based on surveys and census data that track religious affiliation. The other percentages might seem plausible, but they don't accurately reflect the current data on religious identity in the UK. It's worth noting that this percentage has been steadily increasing over the years, showing a gradual move away from traditional religious affiliations.
