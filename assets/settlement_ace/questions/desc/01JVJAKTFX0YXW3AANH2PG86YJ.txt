Welsh is indeed a language entirely distinct from English, and it's a vibrant part of Welsh culture. To understand why, think back to the history of Britain. The Welsh language, or Cymraeg, is a Celtic language, meaning it evolved from the languages spoken in Britain *before* the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons, who brought what would become English. So, while English has Germanic roots, Welsh has Celtic roots, making them fundamentally different in vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. For centuries, Welsh was the primary language of Wales, and even though English became more dominant over time, Welsh has persisted. Today, it's actively promoted and protected. You'll find Welsh taught in schools and universities across Wales, used in government, and featured prominently in Welsh media. It's a testament to the enduring strength of Welsh identity and a key part of what makes Wales unique within the UK.
