Okay, let's break down the relationship between the UK and established churches. The key thing to remember is that only England has a Church of state, which is the Church of England. This goes back to the English Reformation in the 16th century, when King Henry VIII broke away from the Roman Catholic Church and established himself as the head of the Church of England. This is why the monarch is still the Supreme Governor of the Church of England today. Now, while the Church in Wales used to be part of the Church of England, it was disestablished in 1920, meaning it became independent and no longer the Church of state. Northern Ireland, on the other hand, never had an established church in the same way as England. It has a diverse religious landscape, with various Protestant denominations and Catholicism being prominent. So, the statement is false because neither Northern Ireland nor Wales currently has its own Church of state; only England does. It's easy to get confused because the UK is made up of different countries with different histories, but the Church of England's unique position is specific to England.
