Okay, let's unravel the story behind Henry Tudor's marriage! To understand why he married Elizabeth of York, we need to rewind to the War of the Roses. This was a long and bloody civil war fought between two powerful families, the House of Lancaster and the House of York, both vying for the English throne. The Lancastrians had a red rose as their symbol, and the Yorkists a white rose. Henry Tudor, representing the Lancastrian side, defeated Richard III of York at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, effectively ending the war. Now, to solidify his claim to the throne and unite the country, Henry strategically married Elizabeth of York. This union symbolically merged the two warring houses, creating the Tudor dynasty and bringing much-needed stability to England. Elizabeth of York was the daughter of Edward IV, a Yorkist king. So, by marrying her, Henry Tudor cleverly brought together the red and white roses, ending the conflict and ushering in a new era. Marrying an Elizabeth of Lancaster wouldn't have had the same symbolic impact, and of course, Elizabeth I and Elizabeth II came much later in history.
