The Battle of Culloden in 1746 was a pivotal moment in British history, especially for Scotland. Think of it as the last major battle fought on British soil. The Jacobite rising, led by Charles Edward Stuart, also known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, aimed to restore the Stuart dynasty to the British throne. The clan system was central to the Jacobite cause, with different clans rallying to support the Stuarts. However, the Jacobites were decisively defeated at Culloden by the British government forces. After the battle, the government took harsh measures to suppress the Highland clans, who were seen as the main source of rebellion. Laws were passed to disarm the clans, ban the wearing of tartan, and restrict their traditional way of life. The hereditary powers of the clan chiefs were also significantly reduced. So, the clans lost a significant amount of power because the government wanted to prevent any future uprisings and dismantle the clan system, which they saw as a threat to stability. While the battle certainly affected farmers and the general population, and Parliament's power was actually strengthened, it was the clan structure itself that was directly targeted and weakened following Culloden.
