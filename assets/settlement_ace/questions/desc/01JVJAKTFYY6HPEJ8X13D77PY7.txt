The Tudor rose is a really important symbol in British history, and understanding it helps you grasp the story of the Tudor dynasty. Before the Tudors came to power, England was torn apart by the Wars of the Roses, a bloody conflict between the House of Lancaster, whose symbol was a red rose, and the House of York, symbolized by a white rose. Henry VII, who founded the Tudor dynasty in 1485 after defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field, cleverly combined these two symbols to represent the union of the two houses and bring an end to the wars. He created the Tudor rose, which is a red rose with a white rose inside it, or sometimes a rose with red and white petals intermingled. This symbolized the joining of the Lancaster and York families and the beginning of a new era of peace and stability under the Tudors. So, when you think of the Tudor rose, remember it's not just a pretty flower, it's a powerful symbol of unity and the end of a long period of conflict. That's why the answer is red and white.
