Punch magazine, often just called "Punch," is a really important piece of British cultural history, especially when you think about satire and humour. It started in 1841, which puts it squarely in the 1840s. Now, why is this significant? Well, the Victorian era was in full swing, and there was a lot of social and political change happening. Punch became a platform to comment on all of that, using cartoons, jokes, and articles to poke fun at everything from politicians to social customs. It was hugely influential and helped shape public opinion. The magazine ran for over 150 years, finally closing in 2002, so it really left its mark. The 1810s are too early, as that was the Regency period, before Victoria came to the throne. The 1870s and 1890s are too late; Punch was already well-established and a household name by then. So, remembering that Punch started in 1841 will help you recall that it was the 1840s.
