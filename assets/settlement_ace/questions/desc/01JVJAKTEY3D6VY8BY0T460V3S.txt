The Bill of Rights in 1689 was a pivotal moment in British history, marking a significant shift in power away from the monarchy. Before this, English kings and queens held considerable authority, often clashing with Parliament. Think back to the Stuart monarchs, like Charles I, who believed in the divine right of kings â€“ the idea that they were appointed by God and therefore above the law. The Bill of Rights directly challenged this notion. It was enacted following the Glorious Revolution of 1688, when James II was replaced by William of Orange and Mary. To take the throne, William and Mary had to agree to the Bill of Rights, which limited the monarch's power and established key rights for Parliament and individuals. So, the Bill of Rights specifically curtailed the authority of the king, ensuring that the monarch could no longer suspend laws, raise taxes without parliamentary consent, or interfere with elections. While Parliament, judges, and the Church all played important roles, the Bill of Rights was primarily about reining in the power of the crown.
