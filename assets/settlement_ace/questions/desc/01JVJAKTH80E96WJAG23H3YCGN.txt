The UK Parliament, the legislative body of the United Kingdom, is bicameral, meaning it's composed of two distinct chambers. Think of it as a two-part system designed to provide checks and balances in the law-making process. The House of Commons is the lower house and its members, known as Members of Parliament or MPs, are directly elected by the public in general elections. This makes the House of Commons the primary chamber where laws are debated and passed, reflecting the will of the people. The other chamber is the House of Lords, which historically consisted of hereditary peers, life peers appointed for their achievements, and senior bishops of the Church of England. While reforms have reduced the number of hereditary peers, the House of Lords still plays a crucial role in scrutinizing legislation passed by the Commons, offering amendments and providing expert advice. So, the House of Lords and the House of Commons together form the UK Parliament, ensuring a comprehensive and considered approach to creating laws for the country.
