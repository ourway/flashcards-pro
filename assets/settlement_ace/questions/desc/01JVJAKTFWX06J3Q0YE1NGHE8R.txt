Okay, let's delve into the world of Scottish literature to understand why John Barbour is the poet behind 'The Bruce'. In the 14th century, during Scotland's Wars of Independence, Barbour, an Archdeacon of Aberdeen, wrote 'The Bruce'. This isn't just a poem; it's a historical narrative in verse, recounting the life and deeds of Robert the Bruce, the King of Scots who led Scotland to victory against England. It's a significant piece of Scottish national identity and a primary source for understanding that period. Geoffrey Chaucer, while a brilliant poet, is English and famous for 'The Canterbury Tales' â€“ a completely different era and kingdom. As for Kevin MacDonald and Kevin MacAlpin, these names don't have any significant association with classic Scottish poetry or historical works of that era. So, when you think of a historical poem about Robert the Bruce, remember John Barbour, the Scottish poet who immortalized the king's struggle for independence in verse.
