The 2004 Olympic Games in Athens were a momentous occasion, and for British athletics, they were particularly special thanks to Dame Kelly Holmes. Before 2004, Holmes had a successful career, but she'd also faced numerous injuries and setbacks. The Athens Olympics were her chance to truly shine. She entered both the 800m and 1500m races, which are middle-distance running events requiring both speed and endurance. In a stunning display of athleticism and determination, Holmes won gold in both events. This made her only the second woman in Olympic history to achieve this feat, cementing her place in British sporting history. While Dame Ellen MacArthur is a celebrated sailor, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean are famous ice dancers, neither of them are track and field athletes. Therefore, Dame Kelly Holmes is the only athlete from the options provided who could have won gold medals at the Olympics for sprinting, or rather, middle-distance running.
