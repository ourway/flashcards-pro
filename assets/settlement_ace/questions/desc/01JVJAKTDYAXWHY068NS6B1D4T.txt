Female Genital Mutilation, or FGM, is a deeply harmful practice with no medical benefits. It involves intentionally altering or injuring female genitalia for non-medical reasons. The practice is rooted in gender inequality and attempts to control women's sexuality. Because the UK is committed to upholding human rights, particularly the rights and bodily autonomy of women and girls, FGM is explicitly illegal. The law reflects the UK's dedication to protecting vulnerable individuals from violence and discrimination. Legislation like the Female Genital Mutilation Act of 2003 makes it a crime to perform FGM, assist in its performance, or even take a girl abroad for the procedure. So, while some might mistakenly believe cultural practices are always tolerated, the UK prioritizes the safety and well-being of its citizens, and FGM is a clear violation of those principles.
