The role of the monarch in the UK government is often misunderstood. While they are the Head of State, their power is largely symbolic. Think back to the gradual shift from absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy, particularly after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. This revolution established Parliament's supremacy. Today, the monarch doesn't actively make laws or policy. Instead, their primary function is to advise, warn, and encourage the Prime Minister. This happens in private meetings, and the monarch draws upon their extensive experience and knowledge of history and current affairs to offer counsel. It's a subtle but important role, ensuring the Prime Minister considers different perspectives. While the monarch certainly attracts tourists and may attend some events with the Prime Minister, these are not their primary governmental functions. Helping the PM choose a Cabinet is also outside the monarch's remit.
