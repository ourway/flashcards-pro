The Bill of Rights is a cornerstone of the UK's constitutional history, but the date is crucial. Think of it as a direct consequence of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, when James II was replaced by William of Orange and Mary. Parliament wanted to ensure that royal power would never again become absolute. So, in 1689, they passed the Bill of Rights. This document formally stated that the monarch couldn't make laws, raise taxes, or keep an army without Parliament's consent. It also guaranteed certain rights to individuals, like the right to petition the monarch and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. While 1719 might sound plausible, it's important to remember that the Bill of Rights was a direct reaction to the events of 1688, making 1689 the correct year. Confusing it with 1719 is a common mistake, but remembering the Glorious Revolution helps solidify the correct timeline.
