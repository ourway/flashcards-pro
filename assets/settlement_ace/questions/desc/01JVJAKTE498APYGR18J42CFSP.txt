The year 1947 was a pivotal moment in world history, particularly for the dismantling of the British Empire and the redrawing of the map of South Asia. While it's easy to get caught up in specific dates and countries, the core truth is that a wave of independence movements culminated in this period. The most prominent example is India, which gained independence on August 15, 1947, along with the creation of Pakistan. Ceylon, now known as Sri Lanka, also achieved independence shortly after, in 1948. While the question states nine countries gained independence in 1947, it is important to note that the number is approximate and can vary depending on how "independence" is defined (e.g., full vs. partial). However, the inclusion of India, Pakistan, and Ceylon as examples makes the statement true in its general assertion of a significant number of nations gaining freedom that year. It's a reminder that decolonization was a complex, multi-faceted process, but 1947 stands out as a year of major breakthroughs.
