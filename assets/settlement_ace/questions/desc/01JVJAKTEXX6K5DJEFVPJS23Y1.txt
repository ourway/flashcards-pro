Halloween, celebrated on the 31st of October, has roots stretching back to ancient Celtic traditions. The Celts, who lived over 2,000 years ago in what is now Ireland, the United Kingdom, and northern France, believed that on the night of October 31st, the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead became blurred. This festival, called Samhain, involved lighting bonfires and wearing costumes to ward off evil spirits. Over time, as Christianity spread, Samhain evolved into All Hallows' Eve, the night before All Saints' Day. The name "Halloween" itself is a shortened version of "All Hallows' Eve." The traditions we associate with Halloween today, like trick-or-treating and carving pumpkins, are a blend of these ancient Celtic beliefs and later European folk customs. So, because of this long history tied to the Celtic calendar and the eve of All Saints' Day, Halloween is specifically celebrated on October 31st, not any other date.
