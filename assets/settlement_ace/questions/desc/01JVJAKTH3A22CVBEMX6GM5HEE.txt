Geoffrey Chaucer, often called the "father of English literature," lived in the 14th century, a time of great change in England. He wrote in Middle English, which is quite different from the English we speak today, but his stories are still incredibly popular. The correct answer, *The Canterbury Tales*, is a collection of stories told by a group of pilgrims traveling together to Canterbury Cathedral. This pilgrimage setting is key because it provides the framework for Chaucer to introduce a diverse cast of characters, each telling their own unique tale. Think of it like a medieval road trip with storytelling! The tales themselves are a mix of genres, from romances and comedies to moral stories, offering a fascinating glimpse into medieval society. The other options are simply made up; while they might sound plausible, they have no connection to Chaucer or his work. *The Canterbury Tales* is a cornerstone of English literature, and understanding its significance is important not just for the test, but for appreciating England's rich literary heritage.
