Okay, let's talk about British soap operas! These aren't just any TV shows; they're cultural institutions. Soap operas, short for "soap operas", got their name because they were originally sponsored by soap manufacturers, targeting housewives. "Coronation Street," set in a fictional town in Manchester, first aired in 1960 and is the world's longest-running television soap opera. It's known for its focus on working-class lives and strong characters. "EastEnders," which started in 1985, is set in the fictional Albert Square in the East End of London. It tackles contemporary social issues and is famous for its dramatic storylines. Both shows have millions of viewers and are deeply embedded in British popular culture. News programs like BBC News and Sky News, while important for keeping people informed, are factual reporting and don't fall into the category of fictional, ongoing drama that defines a soap opera. So, when you think of quintessential British soaps, "Coronation Street" and "EastEnders" are the names that immediately spring to mind.
