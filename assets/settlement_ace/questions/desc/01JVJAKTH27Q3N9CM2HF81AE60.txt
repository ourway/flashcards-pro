The 17th century in Britain was a period of immense religious and political upheaval. Following the English Civil War and the period of the Commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell, the monarchy was restored in 1660 with Charles II taking the throne. This event is known as "The Restoration." However, it's crucial to understand that the Restoration primarily concerned the *monarchy*, not the re-establishment of Catholicism. While Charles II had Catholic sympathies, and his brother James II was openly Catholic, the official state religion remained the Church of England (Anglican). The Restoration was about restoring the crown and the traditional system of government, which included the established Protestant Church. So, while there were religious tensions and debates during this period, the Restoration itself didn't signify a return to Catholicism as the state religion. That's why the statement is false. It's easy to get confused because religion was such a hot topic, but the key thing to remember is that the Restoration was fundamentally about bringing back the King!
