The Bronze Age in Britain, which lasted from around 2500 BC to 800 BC, gets its name because it was the period when people learned how to make bronze. Bronze is a mixture of copper and tin, and it was a significant technological advancement. This new metal was stronger and more durable than what they had before, like stone or copper alone. Because of these qualities, bronze was used to create both tools and weapons. But it wasn't just about practicality! People also used bronze to create ornaments and jewellery, showing off their new skills and status. Think of intricately designed brooches, bracelets, and even decorative dagger hilts. While basic farming existed before the Bronze Age, and roads developed later, and gold currency was not a feature of the Bronze Age, the defining characteristic of this era was the introduction and widespread use of bronze for both functional items like weapons and decorative items like ornaments.
