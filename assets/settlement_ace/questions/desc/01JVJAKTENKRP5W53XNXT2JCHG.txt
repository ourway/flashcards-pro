The European Parliament, established to represent the interests of European Union citizens, plays a crucial role in EU law-making and governance. Think of it as the voice of the people within the EU system. To ensure that this voice remains fresh and representative, elections are held regularly. These elections aren't like UK general elections, which can happen every few years depending on circumstances. Instead, European Parliament elections have a fixed schedule: they take place every five years. This five-year cycle provides stability and allows Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) a reasonable term to work on legislation and represent their constituents. So, while other intervals might seem plausible, the five-year term is the established and consistent period for electing representatives to the European Parliament.
