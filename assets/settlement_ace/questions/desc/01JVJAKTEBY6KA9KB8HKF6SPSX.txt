Hanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, is a Jewish holiday commemorating the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in the 2nd century BCE. The story goes that when the Maccabees, a Jewish rebel army, reclaimed the Temple, they found only enough consecrated oil to keep the menorah, the Temple's sacred lamp, burning for one day. Miraculously, the oil lasted for eight days. This miracle is central to the Hanukkah story. To commemorate this, Hanukkah is celebrated for eight nights and days. Each night, a candle is lit on a special candelabrum called a Hanukkiah, adding one more candle each night until all eight are lit. So, the celebration lasts for eight days to remember the eight days the oil miraculously burned. While other Jewish holidays might have different durations, Hanukkah's length is specifically tied to this historical and religious event.
