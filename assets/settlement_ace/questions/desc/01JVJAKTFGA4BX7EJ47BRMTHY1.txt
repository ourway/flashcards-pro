In the UK, a general election determines which political party, or parties, will form the government. The party that wins the majority of seats in the House of Commons usually forms a government on its own. However, sometimes no single party wins an outright majority. This is called a hung parliament. When this happens, parties often need to work together to form a government that can command the confidence of Parliament. This is where a coalition comes in. A coalition government is formed when two or more political parties join together to govern. After the 2010 General Election, no single party had a majority. The Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, won the most seats, but not enough to govern alone. As a result, they formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, led by Nick Clegg. This was a significant event because coalition governments are relatively rare in modern British political history. So, the answer is coalition because that's precisely what emerged when no single party could govern alone and two parties joined forces. The other options are incorrect because a national government usually forms during wartime, an all-party government is very rare, and a one-party government requires a single party to win a majority, which didn't happen in 2010.
