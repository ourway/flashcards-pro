Bath is renowned for its stunning Georgian architecture, a legacy of the 18th century when the city became a fashionable spa resort. The Royal Crescent, built between 1767 and 1775, is a prime example of this architectural style. Designed by John Wood the Younger, it's a sweeping row of thirty terraced houses arranged in a crescent shape, overlooking a park. The design aimed to create a harmonious and visually impressive streetscape, reflecting the wealth and status of its residents. People flocked to Bath to take the waters and socialise, and the Royal Crescent provided luxurious accommodation for the elite. So, the Royal Crescent is intrinsically linked to Bath's history as a fashionable resort town and its architectural heritage. While Portsmouth is known for its naval history, London for its diverse landmarks, and Edinburgh for its medieval Old Town, none of these cities are associated with the specific Georgian architectural style embodied by the Royal Crescent.
