The Crimean War, fought from 1854 to 1856, was a conflict involving Britain, France, and the Ottoman Empire against Russia. It was a pretty brutal war, and it was during this time that Queen Victoria established the Victoria Cross. Now, the Victoria Cross is a really important award â€“ it's the highest award for bravery that can be given to members of the British armed forces. It's awarded for acts of extreme courage in the face of the enemy. So, while Queen Victoria *did* introduce something significant during the Crimean War, it wasn't a new gold currency. It was this medal, the Victoria Cross, to recognize extraordinary acts of valour. It's understandable to think of gold and royalty together, but in this case, the lasting legacy of the Crimean War associated with Queen Victoria is the Victoria Cross, a symbol of incredible bravery.
