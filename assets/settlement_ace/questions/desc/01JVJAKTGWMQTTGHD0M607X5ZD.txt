The First World War, which lasted from 1914 to 1918, dramatically changed British society. With millions of men away fighting, women stepped into roles traditionally held by men, working in factories, farms, and hospitals. They proved their capabilities and contributed significantly to the war effort. Before the war, the suffragette movement had been campaigning for women's voting rights, but their efforts were often met with resistance. However, the war demonstrated women's value to the nation in a way that couldn't be ignored. In 1918, Parliament passed the Representation of the People Act, granting women over the age of 30 who met certain property qualifications the right to vote. It wasn't full equality – younger women and those without property still couldn't vote – but it was a monumental step forward, largely driven by their wartime contributions. The Second World War further solidified women's roles, leading to equal voting rights in 1928, but it was the First World War that initially broke down the barriers.
