England is the largest of the four countries that make up the United Kingdom, and it's home to many of the UK's major cities. When you think about the geography of the UK, it's helpful to remember that England occupies the central and southern part of the island of Great Britain. Now, Norwich, Plymouth, and Leeds are all located within the borders of England. Norwich is a historic city in the East of England, known for its cathedral and medieval architecture. Plymouth is a port city in the southwest, famous for its naval history and connection to the Pilgrim Fathers' voyage to America. And Leeds, in the north of England, is a major economic and cultural hub. The other options, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, are separate countries within the UK, each with their own distinct capitals, cultures, and geographical locations. So, if you're asked about cities within England, remember to focus on the central and southern parts of Great Britain.
