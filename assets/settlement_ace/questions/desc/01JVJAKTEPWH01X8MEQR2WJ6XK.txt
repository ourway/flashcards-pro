The Great Exhibition of 1851 was a massive international showcase of industry and culture, a real Victorian celebration of progress. Think of it as the world's first world's fair! To house this enormous event, something truly spectacular was needed. That's where the Crystal Palace comes in. Designed by Joseph Paxton, it was a revolutionary structure made of iron and glass â€“ hence the name. It was like nothing anyone had ever seen before, a giant greenhouse on a monumental scale. Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, while grand royal residences, were already well-established landmarks and served entirely different purposes. Apsley House was the home of the Duke of Wellington. The Crystal Palace was specifically built for the Great Exhibition, and after the exhibition closed in Hyde Park, it was moved and rebuilt in South London, becoming a major attraction until it was sadly destroyed by fire in 1936. So, when you think of the Great Exhibition, remember the Crystal Palace, its purpose-built home.
