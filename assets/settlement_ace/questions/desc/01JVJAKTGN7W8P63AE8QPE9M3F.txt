Wimbledon, officially known as The Championships, Wimbledon, is the oldest and arguably the most prestigious tennis tournament in the world. It's been held at the All England Club in Wimbledon, London, since 1877. The tournament is unique for several reasons, including its strict dress code for players (almost entirely white), its tradition of serving strawberries and cream to spectators, and its royal patronage. The other options are easily ruled out because the Cup Final refers to football (soccer), and the Grand National is a famous steeplechase horse race. So, when you think of a major tennis event in the UK with deep historical roots and iconic traditions, Wimbledon is the only answer that fits. It's more than just a tennis tournament; it's a symbol of British sporting heritage.
