Wiltshire is famous for one of the most iconic prehistoric monuments in the world: Stonehenge. This ancient site, built in several stages starting around 3000 BC, consists of a ring of standing stones, some of which weigh up to 50 tons! Its purpose remains a mystery, though theories range from an astronomical observatory to a religious site. Now, let's look at why the other options are incorrect. Hadrian's Wall is a Roman defensive structure located in the north of England, marking the northern limit of the Roman Empire in Britain. St Paul's Cathedral, a masterpiece designed by Sir Christopher Wren, is in London, rebuilt after the Great Fire of 1666. Nelson's Column, commemorating Admiral Horatio Nelson, also stands proudly in Trafalgar Square, London. So, while those are all significant landmarks, only Stonehenge calls Wiltshire home.
