Okay, let's talk about driving licenses and age in the UK. Generally, once you pass your driving test, you can drive until you're 70 years old. This is because as people get older, certain abilities, like eyesight and reaction times, can decline, which can affect driving safety. When you reach 70, your driving license automatically expires. However, it doesn't mean you have to stop driving altogether! You can renew your license, but you'll need to declare that you're fit to drive and meet the minimum eyesight requirements. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, or DVLA, will send you a reminder to renew your license before your 70th birthday. After that, you need to renew it every three years, again declaring your fitness to drive. So, while you can drive for a long time, the system is designed to ensure that drivers are safe on the roads as they age.
