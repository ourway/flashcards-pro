The Six Nations Championship is a major international rugby union competition held annually, involving England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, and Wales. The tournament has a long and fascinating history, evolving from the Home Nations Championship, which initially involved just England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, dating back to 1883. France joined in 1910, creating the Five Nations, and Italy was added in 2000, forming the Six Nations as we know it today. Rugby is a popular sport in the UK, particularly in Wales, Scotland, and England, making the Six Nations a significant cultural event followed by many.

The Scottish Grand National is a horse race, Wimbledon is a famous tennis tournament, and The Ashes is a cricket test series played between England and Australia.
