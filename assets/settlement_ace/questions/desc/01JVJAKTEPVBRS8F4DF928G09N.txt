The Reform Act of 1832 is a key moment in British democratic history. Before 1832, the voting system was incredibly unfair. Many large towns and cities that had grown during the Industrial Revolution had no representation in Parliament, while some tiny villages, known as "rotten boroughs," still sent MPs. These rotten boroughs were often controlled by wealthy landowners. The Act aimed to address these inequalities. It abolished some of these rotten boroughs and created new seats for growing urban areas. More importantly, it widened the franchise, meaning more people were allowed to vote. While it didn't introduce universal suffrage – women and many working-class men were still excluded – it significantly increased the number of electors by lowering property qualifications. This meant more middle-class men could participate in the political process. So, the Reform Act of 1832 is remembered for expanding the electorate, taking a step, albeit a small one, towards a more representative democracy. It didn't affect the power of the House of Lords.
