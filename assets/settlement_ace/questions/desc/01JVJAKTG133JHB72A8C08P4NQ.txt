Jury service is a really important part of the UK legal system, ensuring trials are fair and decided by ordinary citizens. However, there are age limits in place. The upper age limit for jury service in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland is actually 75. Once you reach that age, you are no longer eligible to be called for jury duty. This is because the physical and mental demands of jury service can be quite taxing, requiring long periods of concentration and the ability to follow complex evidence. While people older than 75 can certainly be sharp and capable, the law sets a clear cut-off point. So, the statement that you can participate in jury service *up to* the age of 75 is incorrect, because 75 is the limit. You can't serve *at* 75.
