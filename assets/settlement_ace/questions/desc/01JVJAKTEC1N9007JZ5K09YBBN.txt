Mince pies are a quintessential part of the British Christmas tradition. Their history stretches back to medieval times, although the ingredients have changed quite a bit! Originally, they contained actual meat, reflecting a way to preserve meat through the winter. Over time, the meat content decreased, and dried fruits, spices like cinnamon and cloves, and suet became the main ingredients, all encased in a pastry shell. These spices were chosen to represent the gifts brought by the Wise Men to the baby Jesus. Eating mince pies during the Christmas season is a custom that has been passed down through generations, becoming a symbol of festive cheer and family gatherings. While other holidays have their own associated foods, mince pies are uniquely tied to Christmas celebrations in the UK. You wouldn't typically find them at Halloween, Easter, or Diwali celebrations.
