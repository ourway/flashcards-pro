Okay, let's talk about the Hundred Years War. This wasn't just a quick skirmish; it was a really long and complicated series of conflicts between England and France that stretched, on and off, from 1337 to 1453. So, even though it's called the "Hundred Years War," it actually lasted for 116 years! The main reason for the war was a dispute over who should rule France. English kings, descended from William the Conqueror, believed they had a claim to the French throne. This led to numerous battles, sieges, and political maneuvering. Figures like Joan of Arc became national heroes during this period. The war had a huge impact on both countries, shaping their national identities and political structures. The other options, like the Crimean War, the First World War, and the Boer War, all happened much later in history. The Crimean War was in the 19th century, and the two World Wars and the Boer War were in the 20th century. So, when you hear about a long medieval conflict between England and France, the Hundred Years War is the one to remember.
