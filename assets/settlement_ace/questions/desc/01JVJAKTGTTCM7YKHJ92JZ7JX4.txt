The Commonwealth, established in 1949, is a voluntary association of 56 independent and equal countries, most of which were formerly part of the British Empire. While it promotes cooperation and shared values, it also has mechanisms to address serious violations of its core principles. Think of it like a club with rules. If a member country significantly breaches these rules, such as undermining democracy or violating human rights, the Commonwealth can take action. Suspension is one of those actions. This means the country is temporarily excluded from Commonwealth activities, like meetings and sporting events, until it demonstrates a commitment to upholding the Commonwealth's values. It's not a permanent expulsion, but a way to encourage the country to get back on track. So, the statement that the Commonwealth has the authority to suspend members is indeed true; it's a tool used to safeguard the organisation's principles.
