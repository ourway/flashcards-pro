Admiral Horatio Nelson is one of Britain's most celebrated naval heroes, and his death at the Battle of Trafalgar cemented his legendary status. The Battle of Trafalgar, fought in 1805 off the coast of Spain, was a crucial naval engagement during the Napoleonic Wars. The British fleet, under Nelson's command, decisively defeated the combined fleets of France and Spain. This victory secured British naval supremacy for over a century. Sadly, Nelson was fatally wounded by a French sharpshooter during the battle. While the Battle of Waterloo (1815) is famous for Napoleon's final defeat and the Battle of Agincourt (1415) for Henry V's victory during the Hundred Years' War, neither involved Admiral Nelson. The Battle of Britain (1940) was an air battle during World War II, long after Nelson's time. So, because Nelson tragically died during the naval battle against the French and Spanish fleets in 1805, the Battle of Trafalgar is the correct answer.
