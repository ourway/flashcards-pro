The transatlantic slave trade, a dark chapter in history, saw millions of Africans forcibly transported across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas. While slavery existed in various forms throughout history and in different parts of Africa, the vast majority of those taken during this specific period, roughly from the 16th to the 19th centuries, originated from West Africa. This region, encompassing countries like Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Angola, was targeted due to a combination of factors. European traders established coastal trading posts there, and existing political structures and conflicts within West Africa made it easier for them to acquire enslaved people through trade with local rulers or through raiding. The demand for labor on plantations in the Americas, particularly for crops like sugar, tobacco, and cotton, fueled this horrific trade, making West Africa the primary source of enslaved individuals. While other parts of Africa were involved, the sheer scale of the trade concentrated on the western coast, making it the epicenter of this forced migration.
