Edinburgh Castle is one of Scotland's most iconic landmarks, a fortress with a history stretching back centuries. Think of it as a national treasure, and like any treasure, it needs someone to look after it! That's where Historic Scotland comes in. Historic Scotland, now part of Historic Environment Scotland, is the government agency responsible for protecting and promoting Scotland's historic environment. This includes not just Edinburgh Castle, but also other important sites like Stirling Castle, Skara Brae, and countless other monuments and buildings. They're the experts in conservation, ensuring these places are preserved for future generations. Organizations like the Red Cross and NSPCC do vital work, but they focus on humanitarian aid and child protection, respectively. The National Trust does preserve historic sites, but their focus is on England, Wales and Northern Ireland, not Scotland. So, when it comes to Edinburgh Castle, Historic Scotland is the dedicated guardian, making sure its story continues to be told.
