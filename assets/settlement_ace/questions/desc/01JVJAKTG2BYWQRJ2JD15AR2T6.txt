The story of the House of Tudor is really about ending a long and bloody civil war known as the Wars of the Roses. This conflict, fought between 1455 and 1487, pitted two powerful families against each other for control of the English throne: the House of York and the House of Lancaster. Each house had a symbolic rose â€“ white for York and red for Lancaster. Think of it like a medieval Game of Thrones! The fighting was brutal, with battles, betrayals, and even the murder of kings. Finally, Henry Tudor, who belonged to the House of Lancaster, defeated Richard III of York at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. To unite the country and bring an end to the fighting, Henry married Elizabeth of York. This marriage symbolically merged the two houses, creating the House of Tudor, which combined the red and white roses into a single Tudor rose. So, the House of York and the House of Lancaster joined together through marriage and political strategy, forming the House of Tudor and ushering in a new era in English history. The Houses of Lords and Commons are parts of Parliament, not noble houses involved in the Wars of the Roses.
