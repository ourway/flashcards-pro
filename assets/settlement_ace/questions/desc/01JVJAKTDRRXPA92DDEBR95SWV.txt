Diwali, a significant festival originating in India, is celebrated by Hindus, Sikhs, and Jains across the world, including in the UK. The festival marks new beginnings and the triumph of good over evil, light over darkness. The celebrations usually last for five days, with the main day falling on the darkest new moon night of the Hindu lunar month Kartika. Now, think about how Diwali is celebrated: homes, shops, and public places are decorated with diyas – small oil lamps – and colourful lights. Fireworks light up the sky, symbolizing the dispelling of darkness and ignorance. Because of this prominent use of lights and the overall atmosphere of illumination, Diwali is widely and popularly known as the "Festival of Lights." While Navratri is a nine-night Hindu festival and Baisakhi is a Sikh harvest festival, neither of these are directly related to the characteristic illuminations associated with Diwali.
