The Black Death, a devastating bubonic plague, swept across Europe in the mid-14th century, peaking in England between 1348 and 1350. Understanding its impact requires grasping the sheer scale of mortality. While precise figures are impossible to obtain from that time, historical records and demographic studies strongly suggest that approximately one-third of England's population perished during this horrific period. This wasn't a localized outbreak; it was a nationwide catastrophe that drastically altered society, the economy, and even religious beliefs. The plague was spread by fleas on rats, and the unsanitary conditions of the time helped it spread rapidly. While a fifth or a quarter might seem like significant losses, they don't reflect the truly catastrophic impact of the Black Death, which left a lasting scar on English history and collective memory.
