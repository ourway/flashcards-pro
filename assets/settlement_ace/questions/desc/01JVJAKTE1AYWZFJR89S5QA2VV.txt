The Magna Carta, sealed in 1215, is a cornerstone of British liberty because it directly challenged the absolute authority of the monarch. Think of King John, who was pretty unpopular, being forced to agree to a set of rules that even he had to follow. Before the Magna Carta, the king was essentially above the law. This document changed that by establishing the principle that everyone, including the king, was subject to the law. It did this by limiting the king's power to impose taxes and administer justice arbitrarily. While the Magna Carta didn't create a fully democratic system overnight – it primarily benefited barons initially – its core principle of limiting the power of the ruler became a foundation for future legal and political reforms. It didn't establish free education, give women legal rights, or enfranchise all men; those developments came much later through different movements and legislation. The Magna Carta's significance lies in its initial curbing of royal power, setting a precedent for the rule of law.
