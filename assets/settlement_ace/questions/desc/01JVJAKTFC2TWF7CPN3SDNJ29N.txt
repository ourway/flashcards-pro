Alright, let's talk about Napoleon and his adversaries. Napoleon Bonaparte was a major figure in European history during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He led France in a series of wars that involved much of Europe. Now, to figure out who fought against him, we need to think about that time period. Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher were prominent British leaders, but they lived much later, in the 20th century. So, they couldn't have possibly been involved in the Napoleonic Wars. The Duke of Wellington and Horatio Nelson, on the other hand, were key figures during Napoleon's time. Wellington, known for his military strategies, famously defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, ending Napoleon's reign. Nelson, a celebrated naval commander, secured significant victories against the French navy, most notably at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, where he tragically died. So, the Duke of Wellington and Horatio Nelson are the correct answer because they were the historical figures who actively fought against Napoleon in various wars during his era.
