The Queen, now King, plays a significant symbolic role in the UK's international relations. While the Prime Minister and government handle the day-to-day political decisions and negotiations, the monarch embodies the UK's history, traditions, and values on the world stage. Think of the monarch as a kind of "soft power" ambassador. They represent continuity and stability, having often reigned for decades and met with countless world leaders. This provides a sense of historical connection and gravitas that politicians, who come and go, often lack. They host state visits, travel abroad to strengthen diplomatic ties, and represent the UK at international events. While the monarch's political power is limited, their symbolic power is immense. They are a figurehead that many people around the world recognize and associate with the UK, making them a powerful symbol in international relations. It's easy to think that because the monarch doesn't make laws, they aren't important internationally, but their symbolic role is a crucial part of the UK's global presence.
