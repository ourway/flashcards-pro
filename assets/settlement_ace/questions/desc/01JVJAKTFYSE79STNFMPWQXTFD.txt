Henry VIII's reign is a pivotal period in English history, largely because of his break with the Roman Catholic Church and the establishment of the Church of England. To understand when that all began, we need to go back to the start of his time as king. Henry's father, Henry VII, the first Tudor monarch, died in 1509. This meant that the young Henry VIII, full of energy and ambition, took the throne that same year. He was quite different from his father, who was known for being cautious and careful with money. Henry VIII, on the other hand, was eager to make his mark. While 1559, 1609, and 1659 are all significant years in British history, they don't relate to the beginning of Henry VIII's rule. 1559 was early in Elizabeth I's reign, 1609 saw the planting of the first colony in Northern Ireland, and 1659 was right before the restoration of the monarchy. So, remembering Henry VIII's ascendance in 1509 helps anchor the start of the Tudor dynasty's most dramatic chapter.
