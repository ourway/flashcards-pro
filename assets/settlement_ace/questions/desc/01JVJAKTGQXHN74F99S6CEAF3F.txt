Okay, let's talk about the execution of a king! In the 17th century, England was in turmoil. King Charles I believed in the 'Divine Right of Kings', meaning he thought God had appointed him and he was above the law. This clashed big time with Parliament, who wanted more say in how the country was run. Things escalated into a series of civil wars between the Royalists (supporters of Charles I) and the Parliamentarians (led by Oliver Cromwell). After years of fighting, the Parliamentarians won. Charles I was put on trial for treason â€“ a pretty shocking event at the time. He was found guilty and executed in 1649. This was a pivotal moment because it was the first time a British monarch had been publicly tried and executed by their own people. It marked the end of the monarchy for a short period and the beginning of the Commonwealth under Cromwell. So, when you think of a king being executed in 1649, remember the name Charles I and the dramatic power struggle that led to his downfall.
