The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 56 independent and equal countries, almost all of which were formerly part of the British Empire. It's rooted in history, dating back to the early 20th century as the Empire evolved. The organization promotes cooperation in areas like trade, democracy, and human rights. Now, thinking about the options, Germany and the USA were never part of the British Empire. Namibia, on the other hand, gained independence in 1990, having previously been under South African administration, and joined the Commonwealth that same year. Cameroon, a country in Central Africa, was formerly a French and British colony and became a member in 1995. So, because both Namibia and Cameroon have historical ties to the British Empire, and actively participate in the Commonwealth's goals, they are the correct answer. It's easy to get confused because the Commonwealth includes countries from all over the world, but remembering its historical connection to the British Empire is key.
