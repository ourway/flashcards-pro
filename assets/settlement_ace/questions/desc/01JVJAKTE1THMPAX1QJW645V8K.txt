Okay, so Britain and France in the 18th century? Think of them as rivals constantly bumping heads! This period, spanning from 1701 to 1800, was marked by a series of conflicts often referred to as the "Second Hundred Years' War." These weren't all one continuous war, but rather a string of separate wars where Britain and France were major players, often on opposing sides. A big one was the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), where they fought over who would rule Spain. Then there was the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748), and of course, the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), which was a global conflict fought in Europe, India, and North America. This last one is particularly important because Britain gained a lot of territory, setting the stage for future conflicts, including the American Revolution where, guess what, Britain and France were on opposite sides *again*! So, the 18th century was definitely a period of frequent warfare between Britain and France, making the statement true. It wasn't just one big war, but a series of them that shaped the world.
