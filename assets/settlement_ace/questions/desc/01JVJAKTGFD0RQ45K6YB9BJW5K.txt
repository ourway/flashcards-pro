Okay, let's talk about the Labour Party leadership transition in the late 2000s. Tony Blair had been Prime Minister since 1997, leading the Labour Party to a significant victory after a long period in opposition. He eventually resigned in 2007. Now, the key thing to remember is that Gordon Brown, who had been the Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) under Blair for that entire decade, then took over as leader of the Labour Party and became Prime Minister. He served in that role from 2007 until 2010, when the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government came into power. So, while Tony Blair was a prominent Labour Prime Minister before 2007, and David Cameron became Prime Minister *after* Brown, it was Gordon Brown who specifically led the Labour government during that 2007-2010 period. Margaret Thatcher, of course, was a Conservative Prime Minister much earlier, during the 1980s.
