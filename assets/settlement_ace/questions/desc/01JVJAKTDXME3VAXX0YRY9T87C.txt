Catherine of Aragon's story is a key part of understanding the Tudor dynasty and English history. In the 16th century, royal marriages were all about politics, not love. Catherine was originally married to Henry VIII's older brother, Arthur, to cement an alliance between England and Spain against France. When Arthur died shortly after the marriage, a special dispensation was obtained from the Pope to allow Catherine to marry Henry. This alliance with Spain was strategically important for England at the time. So, Catherine came from Spain, a powerful and wealthy kingdom, to become Queen of England when she married Henry VIII. The fact that she was Spanish is crucial because Henry's later desire to divorce her, in part because she hadn't produced a male heir, led to the English Reformation and the split from the Catholic Church. While England had complex relationships with France and Germany, Catherine's origins were definitely Spanish, making that the only correct answer.
