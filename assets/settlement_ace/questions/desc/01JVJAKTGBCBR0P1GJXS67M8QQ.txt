Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II's husband, received the title Duke of Edinburgh when he married her in 1947. The title is a hereditary peerage, meaning it can be passed down through the family, although in Philip's case, it was created specifically for him. Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, is a city steeped in history and culture, famous for its annual Edinburgh Festival, a celebration of arts and theatre. Giving Philip this title was a symbolic gesture, connecting him to a place of significant importance within the United Kingdom. While London is the capital of England, Swansea a city in Wales, and Belfast the capital of Northern Ireland, none of these locations were directly associated with Prince Philip in this way. The title Duke of Edinburgh recognized his commitment to the UK and his role as the Queen's consort.
