Okay, let's talk about St Helena and its relationship to the UK. It's easy to get confused because of terms like "British Overseas Territory." Think of it this way: the United Kingdom itself is a specific political entity, comprising Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) and Northern Ireland. Now, British Overseas Territories, like St Helena, are territories that have a historical link with the UK, and the British government is responsible for their defence and international relations. However, they aren't actually part of the UK itself. St Helena, a volcanic island in the South Atlantic, is probably most famous for being the place where Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled and died in 1821. While its citizens are British citizens and it uses the pound sterling, it has its own government and laws, separate from the UK. So, while there's a strong connection, St Helena isn't integrated into the UK in the same way that, say, Cornwall or Yorkshire are. That's why saying St Helena is part of the UK is incorrect.
