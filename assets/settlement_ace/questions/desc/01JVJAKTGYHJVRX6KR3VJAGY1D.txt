Breaking the four-minute mile was a huge deal in the world of athletics. For years, people thought it was physically impossible for a human to run a mile that fast. It was considered a major barrier, both physically and psychologically. Then, in 1954, Roger Bannister, a British athlete and medical student, achieved the impossible. On May 6th, at Iffley Road track in Oxford, he ran a mile in 3 minutes and 59.4 seconds. This achievement captured the public's imagination and made Bannister a national hero. While Sir Steve Redgrave and Sir Chris Hoy are celebrated British Olympians, they are famous for rowing and cycling respectively, and Sir Jackie Stewart is a Formula One legend. None of them are associated with running, let alone the iconic four-minute mile. Bannister's accomplishment was a landmark moment in sports history, demonstrating the power of human determination and pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible.
