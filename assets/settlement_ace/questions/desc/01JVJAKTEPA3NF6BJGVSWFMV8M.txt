Wales officially became part of the Kingdom of England during the reign of Henry VIII with the Laws in Wales Acts of 1535 and 1542. Before this, Wales had been gradually brought under English control since Edward I's conquest in the 13th century, but it wasn't formally integrated into the English legal and political system. Henry VIII, seeking to consolidate his power and create a more unified realm, passed these acts, which essentially made English law the law of Wales and gave Welsh shires representation in the English Parliament. This is why Wales is the correct answer. It's easy to confuse this with Scotland, which united with England much later in 1707 to form Great Britain, or Northern Ireland, which became part of the UK in the 20th century. The Netherlands was never formally united with England. So, remember Henry VIII and his push for a unified kingdom, and that will help you recall the correct answer: Wales.
