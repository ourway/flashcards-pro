Okay, let's talk about how the UK legal system protects individual rights against public bodies. In the UK, the concept of judicial review is really important. It's how the courts supervise the actions of public bodies like government departments, local councils, or even some regulatory agencies. The idea is to make sure these bodies act lawfully, rationally, and fairly. Now, if a public body does something that violates someone's legal rights – maybe they made a decision without following the correct procedures, or they acted beyond their powers – a person can bring a case to court. The judge isn't going to throw anyone in jail or shut down the entire organization; that's not how it works. Instead, the judge has the power to order the public body to correct its unlawful actions. This could mean changing their policies or practices to comply with the law. The judge can also order the public body to pay compensation to the person who suffered because of their unlawful action. This compensation is meant to make up for any losses or damages the person experienced. So, the judge's role is to ensure fairness and legality, not to punish with imprisonment or closure.
