The Iron Age in Britain began around 800 BC and lasted until the Roman invasion in 43 AD. During this time, the people living in Britain were predominantly Celtic tribes. These tribes, like the Britons, spoke various Celtic languages. Think of it like a family of languages â€“ they shared common roots but had regional variations. The Celtic languages are ancient and predate the arrival of the Romans, Vikings, Normans, and therefore their languages (Latin, Old Norse, and French respectively). So, while the Vikings and Normans certainly left their mark on Britain much later, their languages weren't around during the Iron Age. It's easy to get confused with later invasions, but remembering the Iron Age is tied to the Celtic people helps you connect them to the Celtic languages spoken at that time.
