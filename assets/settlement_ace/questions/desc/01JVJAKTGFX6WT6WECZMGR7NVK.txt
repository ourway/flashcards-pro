That famous "fight them on the beaches" quote is often associated with British resilience, but it wasn't Queen Elizabeth I who said it during the Spanish Armada. The Armada happened in 1588 when the Spanish sent a huge fleet to try and invade England. Elizabeth I did give a stirring speech to her troops at Tilbury, promising to fight alongside them, but the specific "beaches" quote is much later. It actually comes from a speech given by Winston Churchill in 1940, during World War II, when Britain faced the threat of invasion by Nazi Germany. Churchill was trying to rally the British people and make them determined to resist. So, while Elizabeth I was a powerful and inspiring leader during a time of great threat, the "fight them on the beaches" line belongs to Churchill and the very different context of the Second World War. It's easy to get them mixed up because both events were crucial moments in British history when the country faced invasion.
