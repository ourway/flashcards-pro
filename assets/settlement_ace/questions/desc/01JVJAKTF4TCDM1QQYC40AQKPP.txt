The minimum age for purchasing tobacco products in the UK is 18, reflecting the age at which a person is generally considered an adult and can legally make certain decisions. This wasn't always the case; the age used to be lower. However, the law was changed to 18 in 2007 as part of a broader public health strategy aimed at reducing smoking rates, particularly among young people. The thinking is that by raising the age, it makes it harder for teenagers to access tobacco and hopefully prevents them from starting smoking in the first place, as addiction often begins in adolescence. While 16 might seem like a reasonable guess because it's the age when you can do things like get married with parental consent or leave school, it's not the age for tobacco. And while some countries have a higher age limit of 21 for tobacco or alcohol, in the UK, 18 is the key number.
