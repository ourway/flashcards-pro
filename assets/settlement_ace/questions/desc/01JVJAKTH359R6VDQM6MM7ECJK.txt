Prime Minister's Questions, often called PMQs, is a key feature of the UK's parliamentary week. It's a time when the Prime Minister faces questions from Members of Parliament, including the Leader of the Opposition. This tradition developed over time, evolving from earlier practices of questioning ministers. By the mid-19th century, it became more formalized, and in the 20th century, it settled into its weekly format. The main purpose of PMQs is to hold the government accountable for its actions and policies. It allows MPs to raise important issues and challenge the Prime Minister directly. Because it is designed to hold the government to account on a regular basis, it takes place every week when Parliament is sitting. While you might think it happens more or less frequently, the weekly schedule ensures consistent scrutiny. It's a cornerstone of British democracy, providing a platform for debate and accountability.
