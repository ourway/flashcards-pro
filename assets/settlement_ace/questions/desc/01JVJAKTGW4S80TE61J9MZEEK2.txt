Okay, so in Britain, general elections have to happen at least every five years. This five-year period is set by the Parliament Act of 1911. Before this act, the maximum term for a parliament was seven years, but it was shortened to give the public more regular opportunities to choose their representatives. The idea behind this is that it keeps the government accountable to the people. If a government wants to stay in power, they need to convince the voters that they've done a good job within that five-year timeframe. Now, it's important to remember that an election *can* be called earlier than five years. The Prime Minister can ask the monarch to dissolve Parliament and call a snap election. This often happens when the government thinks they have a good chance of winning a larger majority. So, while elections happen *at least* every five years, they could potentially happen sooner, but never later. That's why "at least every 5 years" is the correct answer. The other options, like every three, four, or seven years, are simply not in line with the current legislation.
