The Reform Act of 1832 was a really big deal in British history because it marked a shift towards a more representative political system. Before 1832, the right to vote, or suffrage, was very limited, mainly to wealthy landowners. But as the Industrial Revolution progressed, a new middle class emerged, made up of merchants, factory owners, and professionals. This group had economic power but lacked political representation, which led to growing discontent. The Act addressed this by abolishing some of the smaller, often corrupt, constituencies and creating new ones in urban areas where the middle class was concentrated. While it didn't introduce universal suffrage – working-class people were still largely excluded – it significantly increased the number of men who could vote, enfranchising a substantial portion of the middle class. So, the statement is true because the Reform Act of 1832 directly responded to the rise of the middle class by giving more of them the right to participate in elections. It was a key step on the long road to full democracy in the UK.
