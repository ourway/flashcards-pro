The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 54 independent and equal countries. Most, but not all, were formerly part of the British Empire. It's a unique organization where countries cooperate on various fronts, from trade and development to promoting democracy and human rights. The modern Commonwealth emerged after World War II, evolving from the Empire as former colonies gained independence. The British monarch serves as the symbolic Head of the Commonwealth. So, while the number of countries involved has fluctuated over time as nations join or leave, the current number is 54. It's easy to get confused with other international organizations, but remembering the image of a deck of cards (52) plus the four suits (4) can help you recall the correct number for the Commonwealth.
