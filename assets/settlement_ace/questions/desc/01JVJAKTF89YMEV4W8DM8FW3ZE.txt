Sailing has a long and storied history in Britain, deeply intertwined with exploration, trade, and naval power. Think back to the Age of Exploration, when British ships charted new territories and established trade routes across the globe. This maritime tradition fostered a culture of adventure and skill on the seas. Sir Francis Chichester and Sir Robin Knox-Johnston are celebrated figures who embody this spirit. Chichester, in 1966-67, was the first person to sail single-handed around the world by the clipper route, a truly remarkable feat of navigation and endurance. Shortly after, in 1968-69, Knox-Johnston became the first person to perform a single-handed non-stop circumnavigation of the globe. Their solo voyages captured the public's imagination and cemented their place as national heroes. While Sir Jackie Stewart is a famous Formula One racing driver, and Sir Ian Botham is a celebrated cricketer, they are not known for their achievements in sailing, making Chichester and Knox-Johnston the correct answer in this context.
