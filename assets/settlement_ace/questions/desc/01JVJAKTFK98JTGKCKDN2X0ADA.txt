Okay, let's explore when English officially took over in England's documents. For centuries after the Norman Conquest in 1066, French was the language of the royal court and administration. Latin was used for official records and religious texts. However, over time, English began to reassert itself. By the 14th century, we see a resurgence of English in literature, most famously with Geoffrey Chaucer's *Canterbury Tales*. This growing prominence of English led to its gradual adoption in official circles. The key turning point was around 1400, during the 15th century, when English replaced French and Latin as the language used for official government documents. So, while French held sway for a long time, the 1400s mark the period when English finally became the official language for record-keeping in England. It's interesting to think that for hundreds of years, the language of the people wasn't the language of power!
