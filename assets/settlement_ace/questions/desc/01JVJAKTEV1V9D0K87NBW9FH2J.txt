Boudicca's story is one of fierce resistance against Roman occupation in the 1st century AD. The Romans had begun conquering Britain around 43 AD, and initially, Boudicca's husband, Prasutagus, ruled the Iceni tribe as an independent ally of Rome. However, when he died, the Romans disregarded his will, seized his lands, and treated Boudicca and her daughters brutally. This sparked a major revolt in 60 or 61 AD. Boudicca led the Iceni and other tribes in a devastating uprising, destroying Roman settlements like Colchester, London, and Verulamium (modern-day St Albans). While the revolt was ultimately crushed by the Roman army, Boudicca became a symbol of British resistance to foreign invasion. That's why she's always remembered for her revolt against the Romans. The other queens, Anne, Elizabeth, and Victoria, reigned much later in British history and are associated with different periods and achievements.
