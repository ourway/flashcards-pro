Canvassing is all about directly engaging with the public to drum up support for a political party or cause. Think of it as grassroots campaigning in action. Political parties and campaign groups use canvassing to reach potential voters on a personal level. The idea is to persuade people to vote a certain way or support a particular policy. That's why knocking on people's doors and asking for their support is a core part of canvassing. It's a direct way to have conversations and answer questions. Similarly, handing out leaflets in the street is another common tactic. Leaflets provide information about the party or candidate and their policies, helping to inform voters and sway their opinions. While some campaign workers might be paid, canvassing itself isn't about earning a commission for each vote secured; it's about spreading awareness and building support through direct interaction and information sharing.
