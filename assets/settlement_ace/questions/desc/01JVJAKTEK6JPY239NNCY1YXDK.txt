Okay, let's talk about why the throne passed to George of Hanover after Queen Anne. Queen Anne was the last of the Stuart monarchs. When she died in 1714, there was a bit of a succession crisis because none of her children survived her. To prevent a Catholic from taking the throne, as stipulated by the Act of Settlement of 1701, Parliament chose George of Hanover, a German Protestant, as the next in line. He was chosen because he was the closest Protestant relative to the British royal family. This marked the beginning of the Hanoverian dynasty in Britain. So, yes, the throne did indeed pass to George of Hanover, a German, after Queen Anne's reign. It's a pivotal moment in British history, shifting the line of succession and solidifying the Protestant monarchy. Remembering him as "German George" is a handy way to recall this important transition. While Wales is part of the UK, it's not a family or a person that could inherit the throne.
