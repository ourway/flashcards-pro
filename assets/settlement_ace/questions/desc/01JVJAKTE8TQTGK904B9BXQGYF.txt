Pressure and lobby groups are all about influencing decisions made by the government. Think of them as organized voices advocating for specific interests. These groups can represent a wide range of concerns, from environmental protection to animal rights, but a significant portion also focuses on representing the views and interests of businesses. Now, while they might occasionally interact with individual Members of Parliament (MPs), their main goal isn't to assist MPs with their daily work in their constituencies. Instead, they aim to shape government policy at a broader level. They do this by providing research, presenting arguments, and meeting with government officials to try and persuade them to adopt policies that align with their interests. It's important to remember that while some protests might involve pressure groups, organizing violent protests isn't their primary function or a typical activity. Their power lies in reasoned argument and organized advocacy, not violence.
