Okay, so the European Union wasn't always called the European Union. It started much smaller and with a different focus. Back in 1957, six countries – Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands – signed the Treaty of Rome. This treaty established the European Economic Community, or EEC. The main goal of the EEC was to create a common market, meaning goods, services, capital, and people could move freely between these countries. Think of it as a big trading zone. Over time, more countries joined, and the EEC expanded its scope beyond just economics. In 1993, the Maastricht Treaty was signed, and this is what officially created the European Union, or EU, as we know it today. So, while the EU is much broader now, encompassing things like foreign policy and security, it's true that it *began* as the EEC, a community focused on economic cooperation. That's why the statement is correct. It's a bit like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly – same entity, but a different form and name!
