The head of state in the UK is a role steeped in history and tradition. Think back centuries to when monarchs held real power, making laws and leading armies. While the monarch's day-to-day political power has diminished significantly over time, the role remains incredibly important as a symbol of national unity and continuity. Queen Elizabeth II ascended to the throne in 1952, becoming the longest-reigning British monarch. While Parliament, led by the Prime Minister, makes the laws, Queen Elizabeth II is the formal head of state. She opens Parliament each year, approves legislation, and plays an important role in representing the UK on the world stage. So, even though Prince Charles is next in line to the throne, and David Cameron and Theresa May were both Prime Ministers, the current head of state is Queen Elizabeth II.
