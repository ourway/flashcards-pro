The Millennium Stadium, now known as the Principality Stadium for sponsorship reasons, is a major landmark in Cardiff, the capital city of Wales. It was built to host the 1999 Rugby World Cup, a significant event that put Wales on the global sporting stage. Think of it as Wales's national stadium, similar to how Wembley is England's. While Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland and Manchester is a major city in England known for its football, neither of these locations houses the Millennium Stadium. London, of course, has many famous stadiums, but not this one. The stadium's central location in Cardiff, right next to the River Taff, makes it easily accessible and a focal point for national pride and major events in Wales. So, if you're picturing roaring crowds and the Welsh dragon flag, you're definitely thinking of Cardiff!
