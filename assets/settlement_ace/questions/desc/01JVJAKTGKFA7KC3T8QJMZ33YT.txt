Okay, so let's talk about British Overseas Territories. Think of them as remnants of the British Empire, islands and territories around the globe that, for various historical and political reasons, remain under the sovereignty of the United Kingdom. These territories aren't part of the UK itself, but their citizens are generally British citizens and the UK government is responsible for their defense and foreign relations. Now, Cyprus is an independent country, a member of the European Union, and has its own government. It gained independence from British rule in 1960. Hawaii, on the other hand, is a state within the United States of America, having been annexed in 1898. That leaves us with the Falkland Islands and St Helena. The Falkland Islands, located in the South Atlantic, have been a British Overseas Territory since 1833, although Argentina claims them. St Helena, also in the South Atlantic, is another long-standing British Overseas Territory, famous as the place where Napoleon was exiled and died in 1821. So, because Cyprus is independent and Hawaii is part of the US, the Falkland Islands and St Helena are the correct answer.
