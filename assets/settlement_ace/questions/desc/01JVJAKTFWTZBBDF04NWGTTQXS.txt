The Emancipation Act of 1833 abolished slavery in the British Empire, including colonies in the Caribbean. This created a massive labor shortage, particularly on sugar plantations. Plantation owners needed a new source of cheap labor, and they turned to indentured servitude, primarily from India and China. Indentured servitude was a system where people were contracted to work for a fixed period, often several years, in exchange for passage, accommodation, and a small wage. While technically not slavery, the conditions were often harsh and exploitative. Over the decades following the Act, around 2 million indentured laborers were brought to the Caribbean from India and China to fill this gap. This massive influx significantly altered the demographics and cultural landscape of these islands, leaving a lasting legacy that is still visible today. While other numbers might sound plausible, the scale of the labor demand necessitated a workforce of this magnitude to sustain the plantation economies.
