The fight for women's suffrage in the UK was a long and hard-fought battle spanning decades. While 1918 is often associated with women getting the vote, it's crucial to remember that the Representation of the People Act of that year only granted voting rights to women over the age of 30 who met certain property qualifications. This was a significant step, but it didn't achieve full equality. It wasn't until ten years later, in 1928, with the passing of the Representation of the People Act, that women finally achieved equal voting rights with men. This act lowered the voting age for women to 21, the same as men. So, while 1918 marked a turning point, 1928 is the year when true equality in voting was established, solidifying a major victory for the suffragette movement and women's rights in Britain.
