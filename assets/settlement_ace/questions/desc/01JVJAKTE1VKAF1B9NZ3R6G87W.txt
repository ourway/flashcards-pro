The fight for women's suffrage in the UK was a long and hard-won battle. While 1918 is a significant year in this struggle, it's important to remember the details of the Representation of the People Act passed that year. This act granted women over the age of 30 who met certain property qualifications the right to vote. It was a huge step forward, but it didn't achieve full equality. Many women were still excluded based on their age or financial status. It wasn't until ten years later, in 1928, that the Equal Franchise Act was passed. This act lowered the voting age for women to 21, the same as men, and removed the property qualifications. This meant that all adult women, regardless of their background, could finally participate in the democratic process on equal terms with men. So, while 1918 was a milestone, 1928 is the year that truly marks equal voting rights for men and women in the UK.
