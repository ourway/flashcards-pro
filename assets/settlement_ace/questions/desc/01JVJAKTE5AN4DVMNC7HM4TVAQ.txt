Let's explore some British innovations from the 20th century! When we think about scientific breakthroughs and everyday conveniences, Britain has contributed quite a bit. Cloning, specifically the cloning of Dolly the sheep in 1996 at the Roslin Institute in Scotland, was a monumental achievement. This demonstrated the possibility of creating a genetic copy of a mammal, opening up new avenues in biological research. Now, consider how we access our money. The invention of the Automated Teller Machine, or ATM, revolutionized banking. The first ATM was installed in London in 1967, making cash readily available outside of banking hours. So, ATMs and cloning a mammal are indeed inventions attributed to Britain. While mobile phones and Walkmans are fantastic inventions, they weren't pioneered in Britain. The mobile phone has roots in American technology, and the Walkman was a Japanese creation by Sony.
