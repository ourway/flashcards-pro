Okay, let's talk about the Norman Conquest and why it's considered the last successful foreign invasion of England. Think back to 1066. Edward the Confessor had died without a clear heir, leading to a power struggle. William, Duke of Normandy, believed he had a claim to the English throne. He crossed the English Channel with his army and famously defeated King Harold at the Battle of Hastings. This victory was a game-changer. William, later known as William the Conqueror, established Norman rule, bringing significant changes to English law, language, and culture. While there have been attempted invasions and battles on English soil since then, none have resulted in a complete takeover and change of ruling power like the Norman Conquest. That's what makes it so significant and why it's considered the last *successful* foreign invasion. It completely reshaped the course of English history.
