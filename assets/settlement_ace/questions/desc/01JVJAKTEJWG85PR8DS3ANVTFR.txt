The Tower of London is a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames and has served many purposes throughout its history, from a royal palace to a prison. Today, it's one of the UK's most popular tourist attractions, steeped in tales of royalty, imprisonment, and even execution. Now, the Yeomen Warders, also known as Beefeaters, are ceremonial guardians of the Tower. They're a familiar sight in their distinctive Tudor-style uniforms. But their role isn't just ceremonial; they also conduct tours for visitors, sharing stories about the Tower's history, its famous prisoners, and even the legend of the ravens. So, the Tower of London is the only place where you'll find Beefeaters acting as tour guides. While you might see security or guides at places like the Houses of Parliament or the O2, they aren't Beefeaters with that specific historical connection to a single location.
