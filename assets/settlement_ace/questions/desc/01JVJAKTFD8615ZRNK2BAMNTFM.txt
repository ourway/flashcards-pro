Shakespeare, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language, penned numerous plays and sonnets that have deeply permeated British culture. His works are full of memorable phrases, but some have become particularly iconic and are frequently quoted even today. "To be or not to be" is arguably one of the most famous lines in English literature, originating from Hamlet's soliloquy where he contemplates life and death. Its enduring appeal lies in its universal exploration of existence. Similarly, "The darling buds of May" evokes a sense of springtime and renewal. This line comes from Shakespeare's Sonnet 18, which compares the beauty of a loved one to a summer's day. The phrase captures the essence of May as a time of blossoming and youthful beauty. While other phrases might be well-known, these two have a unique staying power due to their profound themes and vivid imagery, making them instantly recognizable and frequently referenced in various contexts.
