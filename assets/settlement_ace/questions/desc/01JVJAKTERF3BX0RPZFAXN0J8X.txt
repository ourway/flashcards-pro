The order of these events reflects significant shifts in medieval England. The Magna Carta, sealed in 1215, was a landmark document limiting the power of the monarch and establishing certain rights for the nobility. Think of it as an early step towards constitutional law. Then, the Black Death, a devastating bubonic plague pandemic, swept across Europe, including Britain, in the mid-14th century, peaking around 1348-1350. This event had a profound impact on society, causing massive population decline and social upheaval. Finally, Geoffrey Chaucer's *Canterbury Tales*, a collection of stories written in Middle English, were composed in the late 14th century, primarily in the 1380s and 1390s. These tales offer a vibrant snapshot of English society at the time and are a cornerstone of English literature. So, Magna Carta came first, then the plague, and then Chaucer's famous stories. It's easy to remember with the mnemonic 'M-B-C'.
