Okay, let's talk about Irish independence. For centuries, Ireland was under British rule, and the desire for self-governance was a constant theme in Irish history. This struggle reached a boiling point in the early 20th century. Following years of conflict, including the Easter Rising in 1916 and the subsequent War of Independence, negotiations between British and Irish representatives led to the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921. This treaty was a pivotal moment because it established the Irish Free State, which comprised most of Ireland â€“ what we now generally refer to as Southern Ireland. While the treaty didn't create a completely unified Ireland (Northern Ireland remained part of the UK), it did grant a significant degree of independence to the South. So, the statement is true because the 1921 treaty was the legal instrument that paved the way for Southern Ireland's independence, even if it was a complex and somewhat controversial form of independence at the time.
