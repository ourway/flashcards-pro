The Union Flag, often called the Union Jack, represents the joining of England and Scotland under one monarch, James I. He became King of England in 1603, already being King of Scotland. This union of the crowns led to the need for a new flag to symbolize the unified nation. The design combines the flags of England and Scotland. England's flag features a red cross on a white background, known as the St. George's Cross. Scotland's flag has a white diagonal cross on a blue background, called the St. Andrew's Cross. The first version of this combined flag was officially created in 1606. It's interesting to note that the term "Union Jack" is thought to come from the "jack-staff" of naval ships, where the flag was flown. While 1656 might seem plausible due to later historical events, it's important to remember that the initial unification symbol appeared much earlier, in 1606, soon after James I took the English throne.
