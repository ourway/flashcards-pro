The United Nations emerged directly from the ashes of World War II, a conflict that raged from 1939 to 1945. The sheer devastation and loss of life during the war made it clear that a new international organization was needed, one that could effectively prevent future global conflicts. The League of Nations, formed after World War I, had proven ineffective in preventing the Second World War. So, in 1945, representatives from 50 countries met in San Francisco to draft the UN Charter, officially establishing the United Nations. The main goal was to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, and promote social progress, better living standards, and human rights. Therefore, the UN was established *after* the Second World War, not before either of the World Wars, or after the first. It was a direct response to the second major global conflict of the 20th century.
