England's canal system, which became vital for transporting goods during the Industrial Revolution, didn't just spring up overnight. While the English certainly developed and expanded the canal network, the initial expertise came from elsewhere. Think about which European country has a long history of managing water and reclaiming land from the sea. That's right, Holland, now part of the Netherlands. In the 17th century, Dutch engineers were highly sought after for their skills in drainage and water management. When England needed help building canals, they turned to these experts. So, while France, Germany, and Italy all have rich histories, they weren't particularly known for canal building expertise in the same way Holland was. The Dutch brought their knowledge of building waterways and locks, laying the foundation for England's extensive canal system.
