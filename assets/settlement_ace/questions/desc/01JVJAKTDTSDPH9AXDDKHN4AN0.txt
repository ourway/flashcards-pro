Civil servants in the UK operate under a system designed to ensure impartiality and professionalism. Unlike some other countries where government changes can lead to widespread personnel shifts, the UK civil service is politically neutral. This means civil servants are selected based on merit through a rigorous application and testing process, not through political connections or appointments by the government of the day. Their role is to advise and implement government policy, but they must do so objectively, regardless of which political party is in power. This separation from political influence is crucial for maintaining stability and ensuring that government services are delivered fairly and effectively. So, the idea that civil servants are appointed by the government is incorrect because the system is structured to prevent political interference and prioritize competence and neutrality. This system evolved over time, particularly in the 19th century, to combat patronage and corruption, leading to the professional and impartial civil service we have today.
