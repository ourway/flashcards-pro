Okay, let's talk about the Speaker of the House of Commons. The Speaker is a really important figure in the UK Parliament, but their role isn't always obvious. Think of the House of Commons as a classroom, and the Speaker is kind of like the teacher. Their main job is to keep order during debates, make sure everyone gets a fair chance to speak, and guide the House through its business. Now, here's the key: the Speaker is always an MP, a Member of Parliament, just like all the other people elected to represent their local area. They're elected *by* other MPs to take on this role. So, while they have a very important job, they're still fundamentally an ordinary MP. They don't lead a political party, and they have to remain impartial, meaning they can't show favouritism to any particular side. The Speaker's neutrality is a really important tradition in British politics, going back centuries. They give up their party affiliation when they take the job and are re-elected as Speaker until they choose to retire. That's why the answer is that the Speaker is an ordinary MP.
