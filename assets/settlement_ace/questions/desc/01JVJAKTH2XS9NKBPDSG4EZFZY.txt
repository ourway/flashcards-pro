Local authorities, like town or city councils, need someone to represent them at important events and act as a figurehead. This is where the role of the Mayor comes in. Think of the Mayor as the ceremonial leader, a bit like the captain of a ship, even though they might not be steering the day-to-day operations. The Mayor is appointed by the local councillors themselves, usually from among their own members. While the Council Leader is responsible for the political leadership and running the council, the Mayor's role is more about representing the council at civic events, welcoming visitors, and promoting the town or city. So, while a Teamleader might manage a specific council department and an MP represents a constituency in Parliament, it's the Mayor who is specifically appointed to be the ceremonial head of the local council. It's a tradition that goes back centuries, and it's all about having someone to embody the spirit and identity of the local area.
