The House of Lords, one of the two houses of Parliament, has a membership quite different from the elected House of Commons. Its members are not elected by the public. Instead, they are appointed or inherit their positions. These members are formally known as "Peers of the Realm." The term "peer" signifies a person of noble rank, and historically, the House of Lords was primarily composed of hereditary peers â€“ those who inherited their titles. While the composition has changed over time to include life peers appointed for their expertise and contributions to society, the collective term for members remains "peers." So, while "Patriots" might describe someone who loves their country, and "Whips" are parliamentary officials who ensure party discipline, and "People's Representatives" are those elected to the House of Commons, only "Peers" accurately describes the members of the House of Lords due to their historical and formal designation.
