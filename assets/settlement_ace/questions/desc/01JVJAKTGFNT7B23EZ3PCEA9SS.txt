Christmas in Britain is a celebration deeply rooted in tradition, and the Christmas meal is a central part of that. The tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day really took hold in the Victorian era. Before that, goose, boar's head, or even peacock were popular choices among the wealthy! But as turkey farming became more widespread and affordable, it became the centerpiece of the Christmas feast for most families. Now, when it comes to dessert, the traditional Christmas pudding is a dense, rich pudding made with suet (a type of animal fat), dried fruits, spices, and often soaked in brandy or other spirits. It's been a Christmas staple since medieval times, evolving from earlier plum puddings. So, while fish and chips are a British favourite, and sausages and mash are a comforting meal, they just don't have the historical and cultural significance associated with the traditional Christmas dinner of roast turkey and Christmas pudding.
