Driving under the influence of alcohol is taken extremely seriously in the UK due to the significant risk it poses to public safety. The legal alcohol limit for drivers is strictly enforced, and refusing a breathalyzer test is viewed with equal severity because it obstructs the process of determining intoxication. The police need to ensure that impaired drivers are immediately removed from the road to prevent accidents and potential harm. Therefore, the immediate consequence for either exceeding the legal alcohol limit or refusing a breathalyzer test is arrest. While a medical certificate might be relevant in some contexts, it doesn't address the immediate danger. Taking someone home doesn't prevent them from driving later, and a warning is insufficient given the potential consequences of drunk driving. The arrest allows the police to conduct further investigations and ensures the driver cannot continue to operate a vehicle while potentially impaired.
