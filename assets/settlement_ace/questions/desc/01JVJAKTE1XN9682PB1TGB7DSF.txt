Organ donation in the UK operates on the principle of altruism and individual choice. This means that giving your organs after you die to help someone else is entirely up to you. There's no legal obligation or requirement to do so. While the NHS actively encourages people to consider organ donation and register their decision, it remains a voluntary act. You might think that because you signed up to be an organ donor when you applied for your driving license that it is compulsory, but it is not. Registering simply records your wish and makes it easier for your family to honour your decision. The system respects individual autonomy and the right to make personal choices about one's body, even after death. So, while the need for organs is great, the system relies on the generosity of individuals who choose to donate.
