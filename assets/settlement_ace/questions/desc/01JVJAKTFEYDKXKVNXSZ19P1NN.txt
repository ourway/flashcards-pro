The Channel Islands, located off the coast of France, have a unique relationship with the UK. They aren't technically part of the United Kingdom, nor are they members of the European Union. Instead, they're considered "Crown Dependencies." This means they have their own directly elected governments, legal systems, and courts. They make their own laws and handle their own affairs. The British monarch is the head of state, represented by a Lieutenant Governor in each island, but the UK Parliament doesn't legislate for them without their consent. This arrangement goes back centuries, with roots in the Duchy of Normandy. So, while the UK is responsible for their defence and international relations, the Channel Islands are indeed self-governing in most respects, making the statement true. It's easy to think they're simply part of the UK because of their close ties, but their independent governance is a key aspect of their identity.
