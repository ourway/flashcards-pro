Okay, let's talk about why Acts of Parliament are made in the Queen's name. The UK operates under a system called parliamentary sovereignty, but it's also a constitutional monarchy. This means that while Parliament is the supreme law-making body, the monarch, currently the Queen, plays a crucial symbolic role. Historically, the monarch held significant power, but over centuries, power shifted towards Parliament. However, the tradition of royal assent remains. When a bill has passed through both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, it needs Royal Assent to become an Act of Parliament. This assent is given on behalf of the Queen. So, even though the actual law-making is done by Parliament, the formal enactment is done in the Queen's name. It's a symbolic act that represents the Crown's approval and signifies the law is now in effect. You might think it's Parliament's name since they debate and vote on laws, or the Cabinet's since they propose much of the legislation, but the final act of making it law is formally done in the Queen's name, reflecting the UK's unique blend of parliamentary democracy and monarchy.
