Okay, let's talk about the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament. Devolution, which is the transfer of power from central government to regional administrations, was a major political development in the late 1990s in the UK. After years of debate, referendums were held in both Scotland and Wales in 1997, resulting in a "yes" vote for establishing their own devolved bodies. The Scotland Act and the Government of Wales Act were then passed by the UK Parliament, paving the way for the creation of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. Both of these bodies officially came into being in 1999. The Scottish Parliament, located in Edinburgh, has greater powers than the Welsh Assembly, including the ability to pass laws on a wider range of issues and even vary the rate of income tax. The Welsh Assembly, now known as the Welsh Parliament or Senedd, has gradually gained more powers over time, but initially had fewer legislative competencies. So, remembering 1999 is key â€“ it marks the start of a new era of devolved governance in both Scotland and Wales, making the statement that they have existed since then, absolutely true.
