During the Middle Ages, Germany was at the forefront of technological innovation, particularly in areas like mining and metallurgy. German engineers and craftsmen developed advanced techniques for extracting and processing metals, which were crucial for building castles, cathedrals, and other important structures. England, at the time, was eager to adopt these advancements. Many skilled German engineers were invited to England to share their expertise and help develop the country's own infrastructure. This influx of German talent significantly contributed to England's technological progress during that period. While other European countries like France and Italy certainly had their own contributions to the arts and sciences, Germany specifically excelled in the practical application of engineering principles, making it the primary origin for engineers who migrated to England during the Middle Ages. Holland, while a maritime power later on, wasn't as prominent in engineering during this specific era.
