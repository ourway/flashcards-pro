Okay, let's delve into the Cromwells. Oliver Cromwell, a key figure in British history, led the Parliamentarian forces during the English Civil War in the mid-17th century. After the execution of King Charles I in 1649, England became a republic, known as the Commonwealth. Cromwell, as the most powerful figure, eventually took the title of Lord Protector in 1653. This wasn't a hereditary title like a king's, but it essentially made him the head of state. Now, when Oliver Cromwell died in 1658, his son Richard Cromwell succeeded him. Richard inherited the *same* title his father held: Lord Protector. He wasn't a "Lord Victor," "Lucan," or "Sefton"; those are just red herrings. The title "Lord Protector" was specifically created for Oliver Cromwell and passed on to Richard, even though Richard wasn't nearly as effective or politically astute as his father, and he was soon removed from power, leading to the Restoration of the monarchy under Charles II. So, remembering that 'Protector' was the specific title Cromwell held is key.
