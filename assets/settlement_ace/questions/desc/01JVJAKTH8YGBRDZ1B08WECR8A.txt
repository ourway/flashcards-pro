April Fool's Day, celebrated on the 1st of April, has a long and somewhat mysterious history. Its origins are debated, but many believe it's linked to the shift from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century. Some suggest that people who were slow to get the news or failed to recognise that the start of the new year had moved to January 1st continued to celebrate it on April 1st and were then mocked as "April fools." Regardless of its precise beginnings, the tradition of playing practical jokes and hoaxes on this day became widespread in various cultures, including the UK. What's interesting is that the fun isn't meant to last all day. The tradition dictates that April Fool's jokes should only be played until midday. After noon, anyone playing a prank is considered the "April fool" themselves. This is a quirky little custom that adds a specific time limit to the day's playful mischief.
