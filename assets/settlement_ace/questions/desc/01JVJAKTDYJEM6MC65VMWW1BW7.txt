Adam Smith, a key figure of the Scottish Enlightenment in the 18th century, is most famous for his groundbreaking work in economics. The Enlightenment was a period emphasizing reason and individualism, and Smith applied these principles to understanding how economies function. His most influential book, "The Wealth of Nations," published in 1776, laid the foundation for modern economic thought. In it, he argued for free markets, division of labor, and the idea of the "invisible hand," where individual self-interest unintentionally benefits society as a whole. So, while the Enlightenment saw advancements in physics, science, and engineering, Adam Smith specifically focused on understanding and developing theories about economics, making it the correct answer. It's easy to see why someone might think "science" more broadly, but Smith's work was specifically about how money and trade work.
