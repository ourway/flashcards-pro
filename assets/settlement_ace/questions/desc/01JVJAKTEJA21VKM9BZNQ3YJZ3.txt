Saint David, or Dewi Sant in Welsh, is the patron saint of Wales, and his feast day is celebrated annually on March 1st. This day commemorates his death, believed to have occurred on that date in 589 AD. David was a Welsh bishop during the 6th century and is credited with founding several monasteries, including the one at St Davids, which is now the smallest city in Britain. He was known for his piety and teachings, emphasizing a simple life of prayer and hard work. The leek is one of the symbols of Wales and is associated with St David. According to legend, he advised Welsh soldiers to wear leeks on their helmets during a battle against the Saxons to easily distinguish themselves from the enemy. While other saints like St. Peter and St. James are important figures in Christianity, they are not specifically associated with Wales. St. David's Day is a celebration of Welsh culture and heritage, marked by parades, concerts, and the wearing of daffodils or leeks.
