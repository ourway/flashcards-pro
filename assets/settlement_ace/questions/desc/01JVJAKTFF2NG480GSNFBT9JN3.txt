Okay, let's break down what you need to get a National Insurance number, or NI number, in the UK. Think of your NI number as your personal account number with the government for tax and benefits. It ensures your taxes and National Insurance contributions are properly recorded. Now, you can't just walk in and get one without showing you're allowed to work in the UK. This is because the NI system is tied to your employment and contributions. So, you need to prove you have the right to work here, which could be through a passport, visa, or other official documentation. On top of that, you also need to prove who you are! That's where your ID comes in. This could be a passport, driver's license, or other official form of identification. While proof of address might be needed for other things, and your income statement is irrelevant at this stage, the key things are showing you're eligible to work and confirming your identity.
