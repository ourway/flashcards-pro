Hansard is the official record of what's said in the UK Parliament. Think of it as a detailed transcript of debates and proceedings in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. It's named after Thomas Curson Hansard, a printer who took over the publication of parliamentary debates in the early 19th century. Before Hansard, records of parliamentary proceedings were often incomplete or biased. The creation of a formal, reliable record was a big step towards greater transparency and accountability in government. Today, Hansard is meticulously produced and made available to the public. Because it's such an important public record, you can find it in two main places: major libraries, which keep physical archives, and online, where it's easily accessible through the Parliament website. This wide availability ensures that anyone can see what their elected representatives are saying and doing in Parliament.
