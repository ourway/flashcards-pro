Vaisakhi, also spelled Baisakhi, is a significant festival in Sikhism and Hinduism, primarily celebrated in the Punjab region of India. It marks the start of the Sikh New Year and commemorates the formation of the Khalsa Panth in 1699 by Guru Gobind Singh. The Khalsa is the collective body of initiated Sikhs, and its creation was a pivotal moment in Sikh history, solidifying the faith's identity and principles. This event took place on what was then the first day of Vaisakh, according to the traditional Bikrami calendar. While the Bikrami calendar is lunisolar, meaning it's based on the cycles of the moon and sun, the Gregorian calendar date for Vaisakhi has become fixed. So, while the date might subtly shift according to the Bikrami calendar, Vaisakhi is consistently celebrated on 14 April in the Gregorian calendar. The other dates are incorrect because they don't align with this established date for the Vaisakhi festival. It's a time for parades, religious services, and vibrant celebrations, especially in the Punjab.
