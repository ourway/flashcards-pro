Okay, let's break down the Bill of Rights of 1689 and why it's all about Parliament. Think of the 17th century in Britain as a tug-of-war between the monarchy and Parliament. Kings like Charles I believed in the "divine right of kings," meaning they thought God put them in charge and they could do whatever they wanted. This led to clashes with Parliament, culminating in the English Civil War in the 1640s. Fast forward to 1688, and you have the Glorious Revolution, where King James II was replaced by William of Orange and Mary. The Bill of Rights was a key condition Parliament set for William and Mary to take the throne. It essentially laid out the rules of the game, severely limiting the power of the monarch. It ensured things like regular parliamentary elections, freedom of speech in Parliament, and that the monarch couldn't just suspend laws or impose taxes without Parliament's consent. So, the Bill of Rights wasn't about prisoners or slaves; it was a foundational document that shifted the balance of power towards Parliament, establishing a constitutional monarchy where the monarch reigns but doesn't rule absolutely.
