The Victorian era, spanning from 1837 to 1901, coincided with a period of intense British expansion and consolidation of power across the globe. Think of it as the empire hitting its peak. While Britain had been building its empire for centuries before Queen Victoria came to the throne, it was during her reign that it truly became the largest empire in history, both in terms of landmass and population. This expansion was driven by a combination of factors: industrialization created a need for raw materials and new markets, technological advancements like steamships and railways made it easier to control distant territories, and a prevailing belief in Britain's right to spread its culture and influence. By the end of the Victorian era, the British Empire included vast swathes of Africa, India, Australia, Canada, and numerous smaller territories, controlling nearly a quarter of the world's land and population. So, it's definitely accurate to say the British Empire became the most extensive empire the world had ever known during this time.
