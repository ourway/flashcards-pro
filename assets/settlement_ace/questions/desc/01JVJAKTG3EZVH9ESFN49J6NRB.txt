William of Orange, also known as William III, is a significant figure in British history, but he's often confused with William the Conqueror. William the Conqueror, or William I, led the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. He defeated the English army at the Battle of Hastings and established Norman rule, fundamentally changing English society, language, and law. Now, William of Orange, on the other hand, became King of England, Scotland, and Ireland much later, in 1689, following the Glorious Revolution. He's known for defeating the deposed King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland in 1690, a victory that secured Protestant rule. So, while William of Orange did play a crucial role in Irish history, he never took the title 'William the Conqueror' because that title was already associated with William I and the Norman Conquest centuries earlier. The two Williams are separated by over 600 years and represent very different periods in British history.
