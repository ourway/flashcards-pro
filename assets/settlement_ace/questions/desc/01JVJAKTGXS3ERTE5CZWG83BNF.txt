The Church of England has a fascinating history, deeply intertwined with the monarchy and the nation's identity. Back in the 16th century, King Henry VIII broke away from the Roman Catholic Church and established the Church of England, with the monarch as its Supreme Governor. However, the spiritual leadership isn't held by the King or Queen. Instead, it resides with the Archbishop of Canterbury. He's the senior bishop and principal leader, based at Canterbury Cathedral, a site of huge historical and religious importance dating back to the arrival of St. Augustine in 597 AD. So, while the monarch holds a symbolic role, the Archbishop of Canterbury is the one who leads the Church spiritually, guiding its doctrines and practices. It's easy to get confused because of the monarch's title, but remember the distinction: the monarch governs, the Archbishop guides.
