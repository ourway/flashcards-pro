The year 1688 marks a pivotal moment in British history known as the Glorious Revolution. At the time, King James II, a Catholic monarch, was on the throne, and many in England, particularly Protestants, were deeply concerned about the future direction of the country. They feared a Catholic dynasty. William of Orange, the Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic and married to James II's Protestant daughter Mary, was invited by a group of English notables to intervene. In November 1688, William landed in England with an army. James II's support quickly crumbled, and he fled to France. William and Mary were then offered the throne as joint monarchs, accepting the Declaration of Rights, which limited the power of the monarchy and established key principles of parliamentary supremacy and individual liberties. This event is called the Glorious Revolution because it was largely bloodless and resulted in significant constitutional changes. So, 1688 is the year William of Orange invaded, leading to him becoming King William III.
