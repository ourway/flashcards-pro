Okay, let's talk about the population distribution across the UK. While England holds the vast majority of the UK's inhabitants, Scotland contributes a notable portion. To put it in perspective, the UK's population is around 67 million, and Scotland's is approximately 5.5 million. This means that around 8% of all people in the UK live in Scotland. The other options are close, which can be confusing. It's useful to remember that Scotland, while geographically large, has a lower population density than England. This is due to factors like mountainous terrain and a historical pattern of emigration. So, while Scotland is a vital part of the UK, its population is proportionally smaller than some might initially think.
