Father's Day in the UK, celebrated on the third Sunday of June, is a day to show appreciation for fathers and father figures. While activities like driving or playing football are enjoyable, they aren't typically considered gifts. The tradition of Father's Day revolves around children expressing their love and gratitude through tangible tokens. Cards, often handmade, are a simple yet heartfelt way for children to convey their feelings. Gifts, which can range from small, inexpensive items to more elaborate presents depending on the child's age and resources, are also a common way to show appreciation. These gifts are symbolic gestures of love and recognition, making "cards and gifts" the most appropriate answer. Though spending quality time together is valuable, the question specifically asks about gifts, making the other options less suitable.
