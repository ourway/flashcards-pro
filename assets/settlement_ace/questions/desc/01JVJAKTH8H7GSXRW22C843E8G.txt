Okay, let's talk about patron saints and national holidays in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Patron saints are special figures who are seen as protectors of a particular place or group. In Scotland, the patron saint is Saint Andrew, and St. Andrew's Day is celebrated on November 30th. In Northern Ireland, the patron saint is Saint Patrick, and St. Patrick's Day is celebrated on March 17th. Both of these days *are* official bank holidays in their respective countries. This means that most people get the day off work or school to celebrate. It's a chance to celebrate Scottish and Northern Irish culture and identity. While England also has a patron saint, St. George, St. George's Day isn't currently a public holiday, which is a key difference to remember. So, because both St. Andrew's Day and St. Patrick's Day are official holidays, the statement is true.
