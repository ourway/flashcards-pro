Alan Turing and Tim Berners-Lee are indeed the two notable inventors from the 20th century most relevant to the Life in the UK test. Turing was a brilliant mathematician and computer scientist whose theoretical work laid the foundation for modern computing. His "Turing Machine" concept was revolutionary, and during World War II, he played a crucial role in cracking the German Enigma code at Bletchley Park â€“ a contribution that significantly shortened the war. Berners-Lee, on the other hand, is best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web in 1989. He developed the key technologies like HTML, HTTP, and URLs that made the internet accessible and user-friendly for everyone. While George Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel were incredibly important engineers, they lived and worked in the 19th century, revolutionizing railways and infrastructure during the Victorian era. So, while their contributions are significant, they predate the 20th-century focus of the question.
