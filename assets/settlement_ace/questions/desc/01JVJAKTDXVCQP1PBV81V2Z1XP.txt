Boudicca's story is one of fierce resistance against Roman occupation. The Romans began their conquest of Britain in 43 AD, and gradually expanded their control. Boudicca was the queen of the Iceni tribe, located in what is now Norfolk. After her husband died, the Romans mistreated her and her daughters, sparking a major revolt in 60 or 61 AD. Boudicca led her people and other tribes in a bloody uprising, destroying Roman settlements like Colchester, London, and Verulamium (modern-day St Albans). While ultimately the Romans suppressed the rebellion, Boudicca became a symbol of British resistance to foreign rule. So, the correct answer is that she fought against the Romans. The other options are incorrect because Hadrian's Wall was built much later by the Romans themselves to defend against the Picts, Stonehenge predates the Romans by thousands of years, and Christianity didn't become widespread in Britain until several centuries after Boudicca's time.
