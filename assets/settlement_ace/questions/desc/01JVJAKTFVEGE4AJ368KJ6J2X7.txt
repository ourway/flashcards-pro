Civil law deals with disputes between individuals or organizations, where the aim is usually to compensate the injured party rather than punish the offender. Think of it as the law governing everyday interactions and relationships. Landlord-tenant disputes fall squarely into this category. If a landlord fails to maintain the property or a tenant doesn't pay rent, civil law provides the framework for resolving these disagreements, often through monetary compensation or specific performance, like ordering repairs. Similarly, workplace discrimination, whether based on gender, race, or other protected characteristics, is a civil matter. An employee who experiences discrimination can bring a civil lawsuit against their employer seeking damages for lost wages, emotional distress, or even reinstatement to their job. On the other hand, carrying a weapon illegally or selling tobacco to minors are criminal offenses. These actions are considered harmful to society as a whole and are prosecuted by the state, with the aim of punishing the offender through fines or imprisonment.
