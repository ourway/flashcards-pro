Okay, let's delve into the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie. He's a significant figure in British history, particularly Scottish history. To understand why he's associated with the 1745 army, we need to go back to the Jacobite cause. The Jacobites were supporters of the Stuart dynasty, who had lost the throne. Charles Edward Stuart, affectionately known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, was the grandson of the deposed King James II. In 1745, believing he had enough support in Britain, he landed in Scotland. He was indeed championed by clansmen from the Scottish Highlands, who saw him as their rightful king. He raised an army and marched south, hoping to reclaim the throne for his father, James Francis Edward Stuart. This uprising is known as the Jacobite rising of 1745, or sometimes just 'the 45'. While he initially had some success, the rebellion was ultimately crushed at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. As for the other options, Robert Burns was a famous Scottish poet, Oliver Cromwell was a key figure in the English Civil War, and Kenneth MacAlpin was a 9th-century king of the Scots â€“ none of them led a Highland army in 1745.
