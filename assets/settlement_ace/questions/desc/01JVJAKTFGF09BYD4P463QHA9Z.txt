Okay, let's talk about flags! The Scottish flag, also known as the Saltire or St. Andrew's Cross, is instantly recognizable because of its design. St. Andrew is the patron saint of Scotland, and legend has it that he was crucified on an X-shaped cross. This is why the flag features a white diagonal cross â€“ that's the representation of St. Andrew's crucifixion. This white cross is set against a vibrant blue background. The flag's origins are ancient, with some historians tracing its use back to the 12th century, making it one of the oldest national flags still in use. You might be tempted to think of other flags of the UK, but the English flag is a red cross on a white background (St. George's Cross), the Welsh flag features a red dragon, and the Irish flag is a tricolor of green, white, and orange. So, the white cross on a blue background is uniquely Scottish.
