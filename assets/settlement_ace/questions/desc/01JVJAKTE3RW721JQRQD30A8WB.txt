Schools in the UK, like many institutions, often need to supplement their budgets to provide extra resources and opportunities for students. While schools do receive funding from the government and may occasionally seek grants or donations, they also actively engage in fundraising activities to support specific projects or general improvements. Organising events, such as school fetes, bake sales, sponsored walks, or concerts, is a common and effective way to raise money. These events not only generate income but also foster a sense of community and involve parents, students, and staff. Asking parents directly for money, while sometimes done on a voluntary basis, isn't a structured fundraising method. Asking the local council for extra funding is a possibility, but councils have their own budget constraints. Reducing teachers' wages is illegal and completely unethical. Therefore, organising events is the most common and appropriate way for schools to actively raise funds.
