The 19th century saw a revival of many architectural styles, and one of the most prominent was the Gothic Revival. This style looked back to the medieval period, specifically the Gothic architecture of cathedrals and castles built from the 12th to 16th centuries. Architects in the 1800s were fascinated by the pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and ornate decorations characteristic of Gothic buildings. They sought to recreate this grandeur and sense of awe in new structures. The Houses of Parliament, rebuilt after a fire in 1834, are a prime example of Gothic Revival, showcasing its intricate stonework and imposing presence. Similarly, St Pancras Station, with its elaborate facade and towering clock tower, embodies the romantic and dramatic qualities of the style. So, when you think of those iconic, somewhat imposing 19th-century London buildings, remember the Gothic Revival, which aimed to bring the spirit of the Middle Ages into the Victorian era. While "Roman" architecture is a significant style, it's more associated with earlier periods and different types of buildings.
