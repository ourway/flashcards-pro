Diwali, often called the "Festival of Lights," is a hugely important celebration primarily for Hindus and Sikhs. Think of it as a time for new beginnings and the triumph of good over evil, light over darkness. Now, while other religions certainly have their own festivals and celebrations, Diwali's roots are firmly planted in Hindu and Sikh traditions. For Hindus, it often marks the return of deities Rama and Sita to Ayodhya after a long exile, and the lighting of lamps symbolizes their victory. For Sikhs, Diwali is significant because it commemorates the release of Guru Hargobind Ji, the sixth Guru, from imprisonment in the early 17th century. So, while Buddhists and Christians have their own important religious holidays, Diwali is specifically a celebration observed by those of the Hindu and Sikh faiths. It's easy to remember because the vibrant lights and joyous atmosphere are deeply connected to the core beliefs and historical events within these religions.
