Okay, let's talk about Robert the Bruce and why he's remembered as a Scottish hero. In the late 13th and early 14th centuries, Scotland was fighting for its independence from England. William Wallace, famously portrayed in the movie "Braveheart," was a key figure in this struggle, but Robert the Bruce ultimately took up the mantle. The Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 was a pivotal moment. The English army, led by King Edward II, was much larger and seemingly more powerful. However, Robert the Bruce used clever tactics and the terrain to his advantage, leading the Scottish to a decisive victory. This victory significantly weakened English claims to Scotland and helped pave the way for Scotland's eventual independence. While Malcolm was an earlier Scottish king and William Wallace a significant warrior, it was Robert the Bruce who secured this crucial victory at Bannockburn, solidifying his place in history. Andrew is simply not a relevant historical figure in this context. So, when you think of Bannockburn and Scottish independence, remember Robert the Bruce.
