The Bayeux Tapestry is a massive piece of embroidery that tells the story of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Think of it as a visual historical record, like a really, really long comic strip made of wool! It depicts the events leading up to the Battle of Hastings, the battle itself, and its aftermath. Now, when we talk about its length, we're talking about something truly impressive. It stretches out to about 70 meters. To put that in perspective, imagine lining up about 70 standard meter sticks end to end â€“ that's how long this tapestry is! The other options, like 3, 12, or even 40 meters, just don't do justice to the sheer scale of this historical artwork. It's a testament to the effort and detail that went into creating this unique and invaluable historical document.
