William Shakespeare, often hailed as the greatest writer in the English language, lived during the late 16th and early 17th centuries, a period known as the English Renaissance. This was a time of immense artistic and cultural flourishing, and Shakespeare was at the heart of it. While he contributed to English literature in various ways, he's primarily remembered for two specific forms: plays and sonnets. His plays, like "Hamlet," "Macbeth," and "Romeo and Juliet," are still performed worldwide and studied in schools. These plays covered a wide range of genres, from tragedies and comedies to histories and romances. Alongside his dramatic works, Shakespeare also wrote 154 sonnets, a type of poem consisting of 14 lines with a specific rhyme scheme. These sonnets explore themes of love, beauty, and time, and are celebrated for their beautiful language and profound insights into human nature. While novels and biographies are important literary forms, they weren't Shakespeare's primary focus. His enduring legacy rests on his contributions to dramatic literature and the art of the sonnet.
