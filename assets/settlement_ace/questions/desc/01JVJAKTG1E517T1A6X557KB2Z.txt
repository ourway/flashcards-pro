The rose has been England's national flower since the Wars of the Roses in the 15th century. This conflict was fought between two families, the House of Lancaster, symbolized by a red rose, and the House of York, symbolized by a white rose. When Henry Tudor, who belonged to the House of Lancaster, won the war and became king in 1485, he cleverly united the two houses by adopting the Tudor rose, a combination of both red and white. This made the rose a symbol of peace and unity for England. Today, the rose is still a powerful emblem of England and is often worn, especially on St. George's Day, England's national day on April 23rd. The thistle is associated with Scotland, the daffodil with Wales, and the shamrock with Ireland, so while they are all national emblems within the UK, they don't represent England.
