The daffodil's association with Wales is deeply rooted in culture and tradition. While the leek is also a Welsh national emblem, the daffodil has become increasingly popular, particularly since the 19th century. It's closely linked to St. David's Day, celebrated on March 1st, which is the feast day of the patron saint of Wales. You'll see daffodils worn and displayed prominently during these celebrations. One theory suggests the daffodil's Welsh name, "Cenhinen Pedr," which translates to "Peter's Leek," might have contributed to the confusion between the two emblems. However, the bright yellow daffodil is now widely recognized and embraced as a national flower of Wales, symbolizing spring, renewal, and Welsh identity. So, while the leek has historical significance, the daffodil's modern prominence makes the statement true.
