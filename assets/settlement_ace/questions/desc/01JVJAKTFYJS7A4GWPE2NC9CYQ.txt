Voting in the UK is considered a fundamental democratic right and a personal responsibility. To ensure the integrity of the electoral process and prevent fraud, each eligible individual must register to vote themselves. This requirement is in place to confirm identity and eligibility, making sure only those entitled to vote are on the electoral register. Allowing family members to register on someone else's behalf could open the door to inaccuracies or even manipulation of the voting system. While assisting someone with disabilities or language barriers is possible through official channels, the act of registering must ultimately be undertaken by the individual themselves, or with their explicit consent and involvement. So, while it might seem convenient for a family member to help, the law requires personal registration to safeguard the fairness and accuracy of elections.
