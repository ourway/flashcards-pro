The Reformation, a pivotal moment in European history during the 16th century, was essentially a religious revolution. Before this period, the Catholic Church held significant power and influence across Europe. However, reformers like Martin Luther and John Calvin began to challenge some of the Church's practices and doctrines. They believed that the Bible should be the ultimate authority, not the Pope, and that salvation was achieved through faith alone, not through good works or indulgences. This movement, fueled by new ideas and the printing press, led to a split within Christianity. Those who "protested" against the Catholic Church became known as Protestants. So, the Reformation directly resulted in the rise and spread of Protestantism, encompassing various denominations like Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Anglicanism. While Catholicism existed before and continued after the Reformation, and Methodism emerged later as a branch of Protestantism, and Hinduism is a completely different religion originating in India, Protestantism is the direct religious consequence of the Reformation.
