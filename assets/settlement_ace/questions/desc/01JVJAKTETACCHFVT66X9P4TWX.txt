Cardiff is the capital city of Wales, and as such, it's the natural home for the key institutions of Welsh governance. Think of it like London being the center for the UK government. The Welsh government, responsible for devolved matters like health, education, and environment within Wales, needs a central base. Similarly, the National Assembly for Wales, now known as the Welsh Parliament or Senedd, is where elected representatives debate and pass laws specific to Wales. It makes sense that both would be located in the capital. While Newport and Swansea are significant cities in Wales, they don't hold the same status as the capital. Bangor, in North Wales, is known for its university and history, but it isn't a center of government. So, when you think of where the Welsh government and its parliament operate, remember Cardiff as the political heart of Wales.
