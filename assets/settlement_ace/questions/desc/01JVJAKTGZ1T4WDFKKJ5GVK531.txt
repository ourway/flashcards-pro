Okay, here's an explanation of why the Welsh Dragon isn't on the Union Flag. To understand this, we need to look at the history of the flag itself. The Union Flag, sometimes called the Union Jack, is a combination of the flags of England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The flag was first created in 1606 by combining the St. George's Cross of England and the St. Andrew's Cross of Scotland after James VI of Scotland became James I of England. Later, in 1801, the St. Patrick's Cross of Ireland was added to represent the union of Great Britain and Ireland. Now, here's the key: Wales wasn't included because, historically, Wales had already been united with England since the 16th century, specifically with the Laws in Wales Acts of 1535 and 1542. So, when the Union Flag was designed, Wales was considered part of the Kingdom of England, and therefore, its symbol, the Welsh Dragon, wasn't incorporated as a separate entity. It's a common misconception because Wales has such a strong cultural identity, but legally and historically, it was already integrated into England when the Union Flag was created.
