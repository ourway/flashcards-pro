The House of Commons and the House of Lords are the two chambers of the UK Parliament, but they don't have equal power. The House of Commons is the primary legislative body. Members of Parliament, or MPs, are directly elected by the public, making them accountable to the people. This democratic mandate gives the Commons the greater authority. Historically, the power of the Lords has been gradually reduced over centuries. Key moments include the Parliament Act of 1911, which limited the Lords' ability to block legislation passed by the Commons, and further reforms in 1949. While the House of Lords still plays an important role in scrutinizing and amending legislation, they cannot ultimately veto laws passed by the Commons. They can delay legislation, but the elected House of Commons has the final say. So, even though the title "Lords" might sound grand, the real power lies with the elected representatives in the House of Commons.
