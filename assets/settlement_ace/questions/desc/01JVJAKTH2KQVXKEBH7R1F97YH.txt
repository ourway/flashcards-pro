Okay, let's break down the court system in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland to understand why the High Court handles the more serious civil cases. Think of the court system as a hierarchy. At the bottom, you have courts dealing with smaller, more local issues. As you move up, the cases become more complex and significant. The County Court, for instance, deals with a wide range of civil disputes, but generally less complex ones. Now, the High Court is a superior court of record, meaning it keeps a formal record of its proceedings, and it's where the big legal battles are fought. These are cases involving substantial sums of money, complex legal issues, or matters of significant public interest. So, while the County Court handles a lot of day-to-day civil litigation, the High Court is reserved for the more serious and impactful cases. The Sheriff Court is a Scottish court, so that's not relevant here. Peace Courts is not a term used in the UK court system.
