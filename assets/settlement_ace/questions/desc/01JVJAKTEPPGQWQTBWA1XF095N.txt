The Speaker of the House of Commons plays a crucial role in the UK Parliament, but it's a common misconception that they're appointed by the Prime Minister or the Queen. The Speaker is actually an ordinary Member of Parliament (MP) who is elected to the position by other MPs. Think of it as a parliamentary popularity contest! Their main job is to chair debates in the Commons, ensuring that all MPs have a fair chance to speak and that the rules of the House are followed. They remain politically impartial, meaning they don't usually participate in debates or vote. Once elected, the Speaker resigns from their political party to maintain neutrality. While the Prime Minister holds significant power, they don't get to hand-pick the Speaker. The monarch also has no direct role in this election. So, the Speaker is essentially a referee, chosen by their peers to keep order in the House of Commons.
