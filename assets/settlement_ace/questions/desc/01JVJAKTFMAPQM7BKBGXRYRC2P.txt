The English Civil War in the 17th century was a tumultuous period, pitting King Charles I against Parliament. Understanding the nicknames of the opposing sides helps clarify the conflict. The term "Cavaliers" referred to the supporters of King Charles I. This name, initially used derisively by their opponents, suggested they were flamboyant and aristocratic, loyal to the Crown. Think of them as the King's knights, dashing and devoted. On the other side were the "Roundheads," supporters of Parliament, who often had shorter hair, hence the name. The Levellers were a political movement advocating for social and political reforms during that time, but not directly aligned as a sole supporter group of the King. The Luddites, on the other hand, emerged much later, in the early 19th century, protesting against new machinery. So, while the Roundheads were indeed opponents of the King, the Cavaliers were his loyal followers.
