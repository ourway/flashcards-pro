National Insurance is essentially the UK's social security system. It's a fund that helps pay for things like state pensions, unemployment benefits, and healthcare. To contribute to this fund, most working adults pay National Insurance contributions. The system is designed to track each individual's contributions throughout their working life. That's where the National Insurance number comes in. It's a unique personal number, like a social security number in other countries, that ensures your contributions are correctly recorded. Now, while you might not start working at 16, the government issues National Insurance numbers to young people just before their 16th birthday. This is because, at 16, you can legally start working part-time. So, even if you're just doing a few hours a week, any earnings need to be properly recorded for National Insurance purposes. It's a bit of forward planning to get everyone set up in the system as they become eligible to work and contribute. You might think it's 18, when you become a full adult, but it's actually 16!
