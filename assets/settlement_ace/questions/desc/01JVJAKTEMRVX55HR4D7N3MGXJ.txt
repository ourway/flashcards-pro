The Church of England's story is deeply intertwined with English history. Back in the 16th century, King Henry VIII wanted to divorce his wife, but the Pope wouldn't allow it. So, Henry declared himself the head of the Church in England, breaking away from the Roman Catholic Church. This new church needed a name, and that's where "Anglican" comes in. "Anglican" essentially means "English." So, the Anglican Church is simply the Church of England by another name, emphasizing its English roots and identity. It's a bit like calling Britain "Great Britain" â€“ both are correct, just different ways of saying the same thing. The Methodist and Baptist Churches are distinct Protestant denominations that emerged later and have different origins and structures, so they aren't interchangeable with the Church of England.
