Okay, so Henry VIII's story is one of the most famous in British history, and it's all tied to the Church of England. Back in the 16th century, England was a Catholic country, and the Pope held significant authority. Henry VIII was married to Catherine of Aragon, but she failed to produce a male heir, which was crucial for securing the Tudor dynasty. Henry wanted to divorce Catherine and marry Anne Boleyn, hoping she would give him a son. However, the Pope refused to grant the annulment, largely because Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, who held considerable power. Frustrated by the Pope's refusal, Henry took matters into his own hands. In 1534, he passed the Act of Supremacy, declaring himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England, effectively breaking away from the Roman Catholic Church. This allowed him to grant himself a divorce and marry Anne Boleyn. So, the statement is true: Henry VIII did indeed found the Church of England because the Pope wouldn't allow his divorce. It's a pivotal moment in English history, marking the beginning of the English Reformation and a lasting shift in religious power.
