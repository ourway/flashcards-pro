Okay, let's talk about women's voting rights in the UK. It's easy to assume that once women got the vote, it was immediately the same as men, but it was a gradual process. The first big step was in 1918, after World War I. The Representation of the People Act gave the vote to women over 30 who met certain property qualifications. Think about it: this was partly a reward for women's contributions to the war effort. However, it wasn't equal to men, who could vote from age 21. The key year for complete equality was 1928. The Equal Franchise Act of that year lowered the voting age for women to 21, matching the age for men. So, in 1928, British women finally gained equal voting rights with men regarding age. It's worth remembering that this was a significant victory after decades of campaigning by the suffragettes and suffragists. Some people might think it's false because women got the vote earlier, but the question specifically asks about *equal* voting rights regarding age, which didn't happen until 1928.
