Queen Elizabeth II's reign was a long and historically significant one, so understanding key milestones is important. Jubilees mark significant anniversaries of a monarch's reign. While jubilees happen at various lengths, the Diamond Jubilee specifically celebrates 60 years on the throne, not 50. Queen Elizabeth II acceded to the throne in 1952. Therefore, her Diamond Jubilee wasn't in 2010, which would have only been 58 years. Instead, it was celebrated in 2012, marking her 60th year as Queen. It's easy to get confused with other jubilees like the Silver Jubilee (25 years), Golden Jubilee (50 years), or Platinum Jubilee (70 years), but remembering that the Diamond Jubilee is specifically for 60 years will help you answer similar questions correctly.
