Okay, let's talk about 1066 and the Norman Conquest! This is a HUGE turning point in British history. Before 1066, England was ruled by Anglo-Saxon kings. Now, Harold of Wessex was indeed the King of England in 1066, but he wasn't the one doing the invading. The year 1066 saw a succession crisis after the death of Edward the Confessor, leading to several claimants to the throne. William, Duke of Normandy, believed he had a legitimate claim. So, in September 1066, William crossed the English Channel with his army and landed in England. The decisive battle was the Battle of Hastings in October 1066, where William's Norman forces defeated Harold's army. This victory led to William becoming King William I, also known as William the Conqueror. Richard the Lionheart, on the other hand, came much later, ruling in the late 12th century. Canute was an earlier king, ruling England in the early 11th century as part of a Danish dynasty. So, while Harold was on the scene, it was William of Normandy who led the invasion that fundamentally changed England.
