Okay, let's talk about the Wars of the Roses. This was a really turbulent period in English history, a series of civil wars fought between the House of Lancaster and the House of York for the English throne. Think of it like a real-life Game of Thrones! The key thing to remember is that these wars didn't all happen at once; they stretched over several decades. The conflict actually began in 1455, not 1485. The name "Wars of the Roses" comes from the emblems associated with each house: a red rose for Lancaster and a white rose for York. While the fighting continued on and off, a major turning point was the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, where Henry Tudor (a Lancastrian) defeated Richard III (a Yorkist). This battle is significant because it marked the end of the Wars of the Roses and the beginning of the Tudor dynasty. So, while 1485 is an important year in the story, it's the *end* of the conflict, not the beginning.
