Okay, so the tradition of the Queen delivering a speech outlining the government's agenda is a really important symbolic event in the UK. It's called the Queen's Speech, and it happens at the State Opening of Parliament, usually once a year. Now, even though it's the Queen reading the speech, it's actually written by the government. Think of it as the government telling the country, through the Queen, what laws and policies they plan to introduce in the coming months. The Queen is playing a constitutional role here, acting as a neutral figurehead. It's a ceremony steeped in history, dating back centuries, showing the relationship between the Crown, Parliament, and the government. While other members of the Royal Family have important roles, this specific duty of delivering the speech falls to the monarch. The Prime Minister is obviously a key figure in setting the agenda, but they don't deliver the speech itself.
