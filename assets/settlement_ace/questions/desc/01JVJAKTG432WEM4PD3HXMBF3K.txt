Wales has a fascinating history of resistance and cultural preservation. While England was being shaped by Anglo-Saxon kingdoms from around the 5th century onwards, Wales remained largely independent. The mountainous terrain of Wales provided a natural barrier, making it difficult for Anglo-Saxon forces to conquer and control the region effectively. Welsh kingdoms, with their own distinct language, laws, and customs, continued to thrive. Figures like Owain Glynd≈µr later led significant rebellions against English rule, highlighting the ongoing struggle for Welsh autonomy. So, while Anglo-Saxon influence certainly existed along the borders, to say Wales was *under the control* of Anglo-Saxon rule isn't accurate because Welsh kingdoms maintained their independence and unique identity throughout much of this period. It wasn't until much later, with acts like the Laws in Wales Acts of the 16th century, that English law was fully imposed.
