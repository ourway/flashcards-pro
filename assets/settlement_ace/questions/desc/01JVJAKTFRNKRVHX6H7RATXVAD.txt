Actually, girls in the UK generally outperform boys academically at almost every stage of education. This has been a consistent trend for several decades. While there might have been a time historically when boys were perceived to have an advantage, particularly in certain subjects, the modern reality is quite different. Girls tend to achieve higher grades in GCSEs, A-levels, and are more likely to go on to higher education. This isn't to say boys aren't doing well, but statistically, girls have a clear edge in terms of academic qualifications. So, while it might be tempting to think of traditional gender roles, the data simply doesn't support the idea that boys achieve better academic results than girls in the UK today.
