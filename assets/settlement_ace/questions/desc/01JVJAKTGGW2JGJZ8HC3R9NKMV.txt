Oliver Cromwell's story is fascinating, but it's important to remember the specific titles he held. After the English Civil War, when the monarchy was abolished, England became a republic known as the Commonwealth. Cromwell became Lord Protector, essentially the head of state, but he never took the title of King. He ruled England, Scotland, and Ireland with significant power, but he was wary of becoming a monarch himself, likely because he saw the problems it had caused for Charles I. The title 'King of Ireland' is more associated with the English monarchs who had claimed it for centuries, long before Cromwell came to power. So, while Cromwell was a powerful figure in British history, he never assumed the title of 'King of Ireland'; that remained with the monarchy, even during the Commonwealth period when the monarchy was temporarily abolished in England.
