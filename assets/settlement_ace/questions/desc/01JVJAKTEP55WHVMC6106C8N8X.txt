Let's talk about the UK's diverse population. The UK has a rich history of immigration, particularly after the Second World War, which brought people from all over the Commonwealth to help rebuild the country. This influx significantly shaped the UK's cultural landscape. However, while immigration has undoubtedly contributed to the UK's diversity, the statistic that almost 20% of the population has a parent or grandparent born outside the UK is an overestimation. The actual figure is closer to 10%. Think of it this way: roughly one in ten people in the UK have a parent or grandparent born abroad. It's a significant number, reflecting the UK's multicultural society, but not quite as high as one in five. It's easy to overestimate because you see and hear about diversity all around, but the official statistics paint a slightly different picture.
