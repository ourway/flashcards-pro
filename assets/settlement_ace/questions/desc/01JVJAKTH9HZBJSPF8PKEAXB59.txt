'The Lord of the Rings' is a cornerstone of modern fantasy literature, and its author is J.R.R. Tolkien. Tolkien wasn't just a writer; he was a philologist, a scholar of languages, and this passion deeply influenced his creation of Middle-earth. He meticulously crafted not only the world but also its languages, like Elvish, giving it a rich and believable history. Tolkien began developing the world of Middle-earth long before 'The Lord of the Rings', starting with 'The Hobbit' in 1937. The epic trilogy, 'The Fellowship of the Ring', 'The Two Towers', and 'The Return of the King', was published in the mid-1950s. The sheer scale of the world-building, the complex characters, and the timeless themes of good versus evil are what make Tolkien's work so enduring. While J.K. Rowling created the beloved Harry Potter series, Ian Fleming wrote the James Bond novels, and Charles Dickens is famous for his social commentary in novels like 'Oliver Twist' and 'A Tale of Two Cities', none of them created the fantastical world of Middle-earth.
