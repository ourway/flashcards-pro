Okay, let's talk about the social changes that happened after the Black Death. This devastating plague swept through Britain in the mid-14th century, around 1348-1350, and wiped out a huge chunk of the population â€“ we're talking potentially 30-60%! This massive loss of life had a knock-on effect on the feudal system. Suddenly, there was a shortage of labour, and peasants realized they could demand higher wages and better conditions. Serfs, who were tied to the land, started to gain more freedom. As the old feudal system weakened, a new social class began to emerge: the gentry. These were landowners, but unlike the old nobility, they often came from more humble backgrounds and gained their land through various means, including buying it or being rewarded for service. They were "gentle" in the sense that they weren't necessarily born into aristocracy, but they were still wealthy and influential landowners. The Clans are more associated with Scotland, the Serfs were actually declining in power after the Black Death, and the Tudors were a royal dynasty that came much later, in the 15th century, so they weren't a social class.
