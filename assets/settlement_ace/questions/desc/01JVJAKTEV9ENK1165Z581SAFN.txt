Okay, let's talk about the role of the monarch and Parliament. The UK operates under a system known as a constitutional monarchy. This means that while the monarch is the Head of State, their powers are largely symbolic and ceremonial. The real political power resides in Parliament, which is made up of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. One of the most significant ceremonial duties the monarch performs is the State Opening of Parliament. This happens at the beginning of each parliamentary session. The monarch delivers a speech, written by the government, outlining the government's plans for the coming year. This is a very visual and traditional event, steeped in history, and signifies the formal start of the parliamentary year. While the monarch travels extensively both within the UK and abroad, and their actions certainly influence the nation, these aren't specific ceremonial *duties* in the same way. And of course, making parliamentary policies is the job of elected officials, not the monarch.
