Robert Burns, often called the Bard of Ayrshire, is Scotland's national poet. He was born in Alloway, Ayrshire, in 1759 and his poems and songs are deeply rooted in Scottish culture and the Scots language. Burns wrote about everyday life, love, nature, and social issues, making his work accessible and relatable to people from all walks of life. His most famous works include "Auld Lang Syne," which is sung around the world on New Year's Eve, and "Tam o' Shanter," a narrative poem about a drunken farmer's encounter with witches. Burns's influence on Scottish literature and identity is immense, and he is celebrated annually on Burns Night, January 25th, with traditional Scottish food, music, and recitations of his poetry. So, while the UK includes England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, Robert Burns is specifically a Scottish cultural icon, making Scotland the only correct answer.
