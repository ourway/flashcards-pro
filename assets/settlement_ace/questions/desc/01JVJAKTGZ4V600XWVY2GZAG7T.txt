The Council of Europe, established in 1949, is often confused with the European Union, but they are distinct entities with different roles. The Council of Europe focuses on promoting human rights, democracy, and the rule of law across Europe through international conventions and agreements. Think of it as a forum for discussion and cooperation. A key example is the European Convention on Human Rights, which the Council of Europe created. This convention established the European Court of Human Rights, where individuals can bring cases if they believe their rights have been violated. However, the Council of Europe doesn't have the power to create laws that are directly enforceable in member states. That power lies with bodies like the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union within the EU framework. So, while the Council of Europe is influential in shaping standards and promoting cooperation, it doesn't actually enact European laws.
