The Statute of Rhuddlan, enacted in 1284, is a key moment in the relationship between England and Wales. To understand it, we need to remember that before this, Wales was made up of several independent principalities, often in conflict with each other and with the English. Edward I of England had conquered Wales a few years prior, and the Statute was his way of solidifying English rule. It essentially annexed Wales to England, imposing English law and administrative systems. This meant Welsh laws were replaced, and English counties were established in Wales. While it didn't completely erase Welsh culture, it marked a significant loss of Welsh independence and self-governance. It's interesting to note that Edward I built impressive castles like Conwy and Caernarfon to reinforce his control, which are now UNESCO World Heritage sites. So, the Statute of Rhuddlan is all about England formally taking control of Wales and integrating it into the English legal and political structure.
