The Council of Europe, established in 1949, plays a vital role in upholding human rights, democracy, and the rule of law across the continent. Think of it as a forum where European countries come together to discuss and agree on common standards and values. A key achievement is the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects fundamental rights like freedom of speech and the right to a fair trial. However, it's important to understand that the Council of Europe *doesn't* make laws that directly apply to member states. Instead, it creates conventions and recommendations. Member states can then choose to incorporate these into their own national laws. The *European Union*, on the other hand, *does* have the power to create laws that are binding on its member states. So, while the Council of Europe is influential in shaping legal standards, it's not a legislative body itself, making the statement that it has the authority to legislate false.
