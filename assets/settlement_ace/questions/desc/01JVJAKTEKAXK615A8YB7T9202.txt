Life expectancy in the UK has indeed increased significantly over the past century, and this is largely thanks to improvements in living standards and healthcare. Think about it: access to better nutrition, sanitation, and housing plays a huge role. Historically, diseases like tuberculosis and cholera were rampant, but public health initiatives and advancements in medicine have dramatically reduced their impact. The creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948 was a pivotal moment, providing free healthcare at the point of use and ensuring that more people could access medical treatment regardless of their income. While there are still health inequalities, the overall trend is towards longer lives, making the statement that people in the UK are living longer due to improved living standards and healthcare undeniably true. It's a testament to the progress made in public health and social welfare.
