Before a general election, every registered voter in the UK receives a poll card. Think of it as your personal invitation to participate in the democratic process. This card contains important information like your name, address, and the location of your designated polling station. It's not compulsory to bring it with you to vote, you can still vote if you forget it, as long as you are registered. The poll card simply speeds up the process because it helps the polling station staff quickly find your name on the electoral register. Now, you might be thinking about a "poll tax relief," but that's completely different. The poll tax, officially called the Community Charge, was a deeply unpopular tax introduced in the late 1980s that led to widespread protests, so a "relief" wouldn't be sent out before an election. Also, while polling stations can get busy, you don't receive a specific number to queue or a designated time to vote; you can generally vote anytime during opening hours on polling day.
