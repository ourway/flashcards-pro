The United Nations was founded in 1945, right after the devastation of World War II. Think about the global mood at that time â€“ countries were desperate to avoid another large-scale conflict. The League of Nations, a similar organization formed after World War I, had failed to prevent the second global war, so there was a real need for a stronger, more effective international body. The main aim of the UN, as laid out in its charter, is to maintain international peace and security. While the UN does important work in many areas, like fighting poverty, disease, and hunger, these are secondary to its core mission. Preventing war is the UN's primary focus because without peace, it's much harder to address other global challenges effectively. So, while the UN does work to prevent starvation, high inflation, and diseases, these are not the primary goals of the organization.
