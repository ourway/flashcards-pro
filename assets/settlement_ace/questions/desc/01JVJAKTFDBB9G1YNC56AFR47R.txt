The Church of England's history is deeply intertwined with the story of England itself. It emerged from the English Reformation in the 16th century when King Henry VIII broke away from the Roman Catholic Church. He wanted to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and the Pope wouldn't grant it. This led to the Act of Supremacy in 1534, declaring the King, not the Pope, as the head of the Church in England. While initially, the church maintained many Catholic traditions, it gradually developed its own distinct identity. The term "Anglican Church" is essentially a synonym for the Church of England, used more broadly to describe churches that are historically linked to it, forming the worldwide Anglican Communion. So, while the Church of England is definitely Christian, and was originally Catholic, the specific and most accurate alternative name for it is the Anglican Church.
