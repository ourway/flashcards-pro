Police and Crime Commissioners, or PCCs, are all about local accountability in policing. Think of them as the public's voice in how their local police force is run. Now, the key thing to remember is that they're directly elected by the public. This system was introduced in 2012 to replace police authorities, with the aim of making policing more accountable to the communities they serve. The idea is that because PCCs are elected, they have a direct mandate from the people, and that makes them more responsive to local concerns about crime and policing. So, while local councils are involved in many aspects of local government, they don't get to appoint the PCC. It's a public election, just like electing a Member of Parliament, but on a local, policing level. This direct election ensures that the PCC is accountable to the people they serve, not just to other politicians or officials.
