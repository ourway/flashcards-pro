'The Canterbury Tales' is a cornerstone of English literature, offering a vibrant snapshot of medieval society. Think of it as a literary road trip! Geoffrey Chaucer, who lived from around 1343 to 1400, is widely regarded as the father of English literature, and this work is his most famous. The tales are written in Middle English, which can seem a bit foreign to modern readers, but they provide invaluable insights into the lives, beliefs, and social structures of 14th-century England. The stories are framed as tales told by a diverse group of pilgrims traveling together to Canterbury Cathedral. While J.K. Rowling is a modern literary icon, and Charles Dickens captured Victorian England, and William Caxton was the first English printer, it's Chaucer's voice that echoes from the medieval period through 'The Canterbury Tales'.
