The order of the Patron Saints' Days reflects the calendar order of the saints' feast days. St David, the patron saint of Wales, is celebrated on March 1st. He was a Welsh bishop during the 6th century and helped spread Christianity throughout Wales. Next up is St Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland, celebrated on March 17th. St Patrick is credited with bringing Christianity to Ireland in the 5th century. St George, the patron saint of England, is celebrated on April 23rd. Although the legends surrounding St George are varied, he became a popular figure during the Crusades. Finally, St Andrew, the patron saint of Scotland, is celebrated on November 30th. He was one of Jesus's twelve apostles and is said to have been crucified on an X-shaped cross. So, remembering the months helps you remember the order of the saints' days: March, March, April, and November. It's easy to mix them up, but thinking about the calendar helps!
