The concept of marital rape was a long-contested issue in British law. Historically, there was a legal assumption that a woman consented to sexual intercourse within marriage, essentially granting husbands immunity from rape charges. This stemmed from outdated views of marriage and women's rights. However, this changed significantly over time, reflecting evolving societal attitudes and legal reforms. Landmark cases and persistent campaigning by women's rights activists gradually eroded this immunity. Finally, in 1991, the House of Lords ruled that a husband could be charged with raping his wife. This ruling was a watershed moment, recognizing that forced sexual activity is a crime regardless of marital status. So, the idea that a husband has an inherent "right" to sex with his wife is completely false and illegal. The law now clearly states that any person, including a spouse, can be charged with rape if they force someone into sexual activity without consent.
