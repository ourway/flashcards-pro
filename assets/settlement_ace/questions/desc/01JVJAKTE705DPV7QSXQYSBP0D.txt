Remembrance Day, observed on November 11th, is a significant day in the UK to honour the sacrifices of armed forces members who have died in the line of duty since World War I. The date itself, the 11th of November, marks the armistice signed between the Allies and Germany that ended the war. This armistice was signed at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918. Because of this historical moment, the two-minute silence is traditionally observed at 11 am on Remembrance Day. This specific time serves as a direct link to the end of World War I and provides a moment for collective reflection and gratitude for those who served and sacrificed. Choosing a different time would lose this important historical connection to the armistice.
