Edinburgh is the heart and soul of 'the Fringe,' the world's largest arts festival. Think of Edinburgh as the cultural capital of Scotland, steeped in history and known for its vibrant arts scene. The Fringe started back in 1947, when eight theatre groups turned up uninvited to the Edinburgh International Festival, an event designed to celebrate and enrich European cultural life after the Second World War. These groups weren't officially part of the festival, so they performed on the "fringe" of it â€“ hence the name! Over the years, it's exploded into a massive celebration of theatre, comedy, dance, music, and more, taking over the entire city each August. While Fraserburgh, Inverness, and St Andrews are all lovely places in Scotland, they simply don't have the established infrastructure, history, or reputation for hosting such a large and internationally renowned arts festival. So, when you think of 'the Fringe,' think of Edinburgh's bustling streets and overflowing venues.
