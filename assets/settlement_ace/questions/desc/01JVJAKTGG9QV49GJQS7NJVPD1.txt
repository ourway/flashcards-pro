Okay, let's break down why smoking in prohibited public places is a criminal offence. The UK has steadily tightened its laws around smoking, primarily to protect public health. Think back to 2007, when England introduced a comprehensive ban on smoking in virtually all enclosed public places and workplaces. This followed similar moves in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The aim was to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke, which is a known health hazard. So, while disputes about faulty goods, unfair dismissal, or unpaid rent are certainly legal issues, they fall under civil law. These are disagreements between private parties that are usually resolved through compensation or other remedies. Criminal law, on the other hand, deals with offences against society as a whole. Smoking where it's banned is a criminal offence because it violates the law designed to protect the public's well-being, and you could face a fine for doing so.
