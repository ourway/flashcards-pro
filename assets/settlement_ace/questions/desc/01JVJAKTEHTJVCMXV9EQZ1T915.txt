Wallace and Gromit are those charming characters made using clay animation, a technique where figures are sculpted, photographed in slightly different poses, and then played back in sequence to create the illusion of movement. This falls squarely into the category of animated films. Animation, in general, is the process of creating the illusion of motion through the rapid display of a sequence of images. While animation can take many forms today, including computer-generated imagery (CGI), Wallace and Gromit's distinct style uses stop-motion clay animation. The other options just don't fit. Silent movies rely on visual storytelling without spoken dialogue, action films are known for stunts and special effects, and soap operas are dramatic television series. Wallace and Gromit, with their clay figures and frame-by-frame animation, are a classic example of animated filmmaking.
