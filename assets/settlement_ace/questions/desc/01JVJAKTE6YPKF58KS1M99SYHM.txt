Wales, a constituent country of the United Kingdom, has a rich history and distinct cultural identity. While it might seem like any of its major cities could be the capital, the title belongs to Cardiff. Cardiff's selection as the capital city in 1955 was a relatively recent decision compared to other UK capitals. Before that, Wales didn't have an officially recognised capital. Cardiff's growth as a major port during the Industrial Revolution, particularly for coal export, contributed to its prominence. It also boasts significant cultural institutions like the National Museum Cardiff and the Wales Millennium Centre, making it a hub for Welsh arts and media. While Bangor has a historic cathedral and Newport became a city more recently in 2002, and Swansea is Wales's second-largest city with a beautiful coastline, none of them hold the official status and central functions of the capital like Cardiff does.
