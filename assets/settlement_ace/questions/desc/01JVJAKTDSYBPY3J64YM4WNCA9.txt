Okay, let's break down England's involvement in medieval conflicts. The Middle Ages, roughly from the 5th to the 15th century, saw England embroiled in several major events. The Crusades, a series of religious wars, were a significant part of this era. Starting in the late 11th century, European Christians, including many from England, went on these Crusades to the Holy Land. Think of Richard the Lionheart, a famous English king, who spent a considerable amount of time fighting in the Third Crusade. Then there's the Hundred Years' War, a prolonged conflict between England and France lasting from 1337 to 1453. This war was fought over the English claim to the French throne and involved iconic battles like Cr√©cy and Agincourt. So, the Crusades and the Hundred Years' War are definitely two major conflicts that England participated in during the Middle Ages. The Crimean and Peninsular Wars, on the other hand, are much later, taking place in the 19th century, long after the medieval period had ended.
