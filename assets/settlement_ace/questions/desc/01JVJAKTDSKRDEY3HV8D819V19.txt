Lord Byron, a leading figure of the Romantic movement in the early 19th century, was known for his passionate and often melancholic poetry. Romanticism emphasized emotion, individualism, and the beauty of nature. "She Walks in Beauty," published in 1814, perfectly embodies these themes. The poem describes an unnamed woman whose beauty is a harmonious blend of inner goodness and outward appearance, a common ideal in Romantic poetry. The poem's focus on beauty, both internal and external, and its lyrical language are hallmarks of Byron's style. "The Tyger" was written by William Blake, another Romantic poet, but his style is quite different, often exploring darker themes and symbolism. "The Daffodils" is a Wordsworth poem, celebrating the beauty of nature in a simple, accessible way. "Anthem for Doomed Youth" is a poignant war poem by Wilfred Owen, a 20th-century poet known for his stark depictions of the horrors of World War I, making it chronologically and thematically distinct from Byron's work.
