Rudyard Kipling, the celebrated author of classics like "The Jungle Book" and "Kim," is actually deeply connected to India, not South Africa. He was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, in 1865, during the time when India was part of the British Empire. His early life in India profoundly influenced his writing, providing the rich settings and cultural nuances that characterize many of his stories. While Kipling did spend some time in South Africa later in his life, even writing some works there, his origins and the core of his literary inspiration are firmly rooted in the Indian subcontinent. So, while it might be tempting to think of him as South African because he lived there for a period, remembering his birthplace and the strong Indian themes in his most famous works will help you recall that he wasn't originally from South Africa.
