Wimbledon is synonymous with tennis, a sport deeply ingrained in British culture. The Wimbledon Championships, officially "The Championships, Wimbledon," is the oldest tennis tournament in the world, first held in 1877 at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club near Wimbledon, London. It's one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, the others being the Australian Open, the French Open, and the US Open. What makes Wimbledon unique is that it's still played on grass, a surface that favors a fast-paced, serve-and-volley style of play. The tournament is steeped in tradition, from the strict all-white dress code for players to the consumption of strawberries and cream by spectators. Soccer, or football as it's known in the UK, is a completely different sport with its own rich history and traditions, and while incredibly popular, it has no connection to the Wimbledon Championships. So, the statement associating Wimbledon with soccer is incorrect because Wimbledon is exclusively a prestigious tennis event.
