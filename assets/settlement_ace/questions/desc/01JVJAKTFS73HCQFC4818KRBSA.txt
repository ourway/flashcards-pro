The Council of Europe is an international organisation founded in 1949, predating the European Union. Its main goal is to uphold human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in Europe. It's important not to confuse it with the EU, as it has a much broader membership. Think of it as a wider circle of European nations committed to these core values. The UK was one of the founding members and remains a part of it. The Council achieves its aims through various conventions and treaties, most notably the European Convention on Human Rights. As of today, the Council of Europe includes 47 member states, encompassing almost every country on the European continent. This large number reflects its commitment to inclusivity and its focus on shared values across a diverse range of nations. The other numbers are incorrect because they represent smaller groupings or are simply inaccurate counts of the Council's membership.
