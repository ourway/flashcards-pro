To be eligible to stand for election as a Member of Parliament in the UK, you actually only need to be 18 years old. This age requirement reflects the broader rights and responsibilities granted to adults at 18 in the UK, such as the right to vote and enter into contracts. Historically, the age requirement was higher, but it was lowered to 18 to encourage younger people to participate in the democratic process and to ensure that the House of Commons is representative of the population as a whole. So, while you might think 21 is a significant age, like in some other countries, in the UK, an 18-year-old is perfectly eligible to run for and become an MP, provided they meet the other criteria, such as being a British citizen, a citizen of the Republic of Ireland, or a Commonwealth citizen who does not require leave to remain in the UK.
