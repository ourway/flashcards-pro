Alright, let's delve into the Bronze Age! This period, roughly from 2500 BC to 800 BC in Britain, gets its name because people started using bronze, a mixture of copper and tin, to make tools and weapons. Now, picture the landscape back then. People lived in settlements, and their homes were typically roundhouses. These weren't just randomly shaped; the circular design was practical, offering good structural stability and efficient use of materials. When someone died during the Bronze Age, they were often buried in what we call round barrows. These are burial mounds, also circular, made of earth and stone. So, the statement is true because archaeological evidence consistently shows that roundhouses were common dwellings and round barrows were the typical burial sites during this specific period. It's a good way to remember this era â€“ round homes for the living, round mounds for the dead!
