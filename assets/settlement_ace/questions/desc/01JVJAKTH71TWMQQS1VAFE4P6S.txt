The quest to break the four-minute mile was a huge deal in the 1950s. It was seen as this almost impossible physical and psychological barrier. Many believed the human body simply couldn't run that fast. Several athletes were getting close, fueling the excitement and competition. Then, on May 6, 1954, at Iffley Road track in Oxford, Roger Bannister, a British medical student, achieved the impossible. He ran the mile in 3 minutes and 59.4 seconds. This was a monumental achievement, not just in sports, but in demonstrating human potential. While Sir Ian Botham is a famous cricketer, Sir Steve Redgrave a celebrated rower, and Sir Jackie Stewart a legendary Formula One driver, none of them were runners. Bannister's accomplishment resonated far beyond athletics, inspiring people to push their own limits. He became a symbol of perseverance and breaking barriers, making him the only correct answer.
