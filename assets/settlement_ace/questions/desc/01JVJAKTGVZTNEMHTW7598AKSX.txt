Robert Burns, often called Rabbie Burns, is Scotland's national poet, and a key figure in Scottish culture. He lived in the 18th century, from 1759 to 1796, and wrote in both Scots and English. His poems and songs celebrate Scottish life, love, and nature. Think of "Auld Lang Syne," a song sung around the world on New Year's Eve â€“ that's Burns! He captured the spirit of Scotland in his writing, using vivid imagery and reflecting the everyday lives of ordinary people. While the other nations of the UK have their own rich literary traditions, Burns is uniquely and inextricably linked to Scotland. His birthday, January 25th, is celebrated as Burns Night with traditional Scottish food, music, and recitations of his poetry. So, when you think of Robert Burns, think of the rolling hills, bagpipes, and passionate spirit of Scotland.
