Social networking is all about connecting with people, sharing updates, and seeing what others are up to, and it's become a huge part of modern life. Now, think about how people access the internet and social media when they're not at home. While a television is great for watching videos and a newspaper provides news and articles, neither is really designed for interactive social networking on the move. And sending a "post," meaning a letter, is far too slow for the instant communication that social media demands! The key here is portability and instant access. A mobile phone, especially a smartphone, allows you to access social media apps and websites from almost anywhere, making it the perfect device for social networking while you're out and about. It's like having a pocket-sized social hub!
