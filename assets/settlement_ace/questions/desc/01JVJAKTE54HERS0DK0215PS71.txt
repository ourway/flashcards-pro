St. Valentine's Day, celebrated on February 14th, is all about love and affection. Its origins are a bit murky, but it's believed to stem from several ancient Roman festivals, including Lupercalia, a fertility festival held in mid-February. By the Middle Ages, the day became associated with romance. Geoffrey Chaucer, the famous author of *The Canterbury Tales*, helped popularize the idea of Valentine's Day as a day for lovers in his poems. Over time, it evolved into the tradition we know today, with people exchanging cards, flowers, chocolates, and other gifts with their loved ones. While February might feel cold and dreary, St. Valentine's Day brings a touch of warmth and romance to the month. The other options are incorrect because they fall on different dates and celebrate different things. February Fool's Day isn't a real holiday, Remembrance Day is in November to remember those who died in war, and St. Patrick's Day is on March 17th, celebrating Irish culture.
