The Battle of Britain was a pivotal moment in World War II, fought entirely in the air over Britain. It took place during the summer of 1940, specifically from July to October. Germany aimed to gain air superiority over the Royal Air Force (RAF) in preparation for a potential invasion of Britain, codenamed Operation Sea Lion. The Luftwaffe, the German air force, relentlessly attacked British airfields, radar stations, and cities. The RAF, though outnumbered, fiercely defended the skies, aided by a crucial network of radar stations that gave them early warning of incoming attacks. The hot, clear weather of the summer months allowed for sustained aerial combat. While the war started in 1939, the Battle of Britain didn't begin until the following summer. The winter months would have made large-scale aerial combat much more difficult due to weather conditions, which is why the battle occurred when it did. Ultimately, the RAF's success in repelling the Luftwaffe forced Hitler to postpone and eventually abandon his invasion plans, marking a turning point in the war.
