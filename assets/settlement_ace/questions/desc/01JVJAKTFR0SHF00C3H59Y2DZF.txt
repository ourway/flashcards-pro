The Industrial Revolution, a period of massive technological advancement starting in the late 1700s, was powered by new energy sources, and steam was king. While others tinkered with steam, James Watt made crucial improvements that dramatically increased its efficiency and practicality. Before Watt, steam engines were inefficient and expensive to run, limiting their widespread use. Watt's key innovation was the separate condenser, patented in 1769. This meant the cylinder didn't have to be repeatedly heated and cooled, saving a huge amount of energy. He also developed other improvements like the double-acting engine, which provided power on both strokes of the piston, and the centrifugal governor, which automatically regulated the engine's speed. These innovations made steam power reliable and affordable, allowing it to be used in factories, mines, and transportation, driving the Industrial Revolution forward. While Adam Smith was an economist, Howard Florey developed penicillin, and David Hume was a philosopher, none of them worked on steam power.
