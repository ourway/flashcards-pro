King Henry VIII, who reigned from 1509 to 1547, is famous for many things, but perhaps most of all for having six wives! Understanding his marital history is a key part of understanding Tudor history. Now, while none of his wives were sisters, and certainly not all of them were British (some were from Spain and other European countries), the names Catherine and Anne do come up repeatedly. Henry married three different women named Catherine: Catherine of Aragon, Catherine Howard, and Catherine Parr. He also married two women named Anne: Anne Boleyn and Anne of Cleves, although Anne of Cleves was often referred to as Anna. So, remembering the sheer number of Catherines and Annes in Henry's life is a helpful way to recall this particular historical detail. It's a bit of a historical quirk, but it makes remembering his wives a little easier!
