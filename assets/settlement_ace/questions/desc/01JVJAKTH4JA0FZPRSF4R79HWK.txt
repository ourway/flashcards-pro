The Proms, short for the Promenade Concerts, is a significant event in the British cultural calendar, specifically for classical music lovers. It's not just a short burst of concerts; it's a full-blown, eight-week summer festival held annually, primarily at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The BBC broadcasts many of the concerts, making it accessible to a wide audience across the UK and even internationally. The Proms were founded in 1895, so they have a long and rich history. The "promenade" part of the name refers to the areas where people can stand or walk around during the performances, often at a lower ticket price, creating a more informal and accessible atmosphere. So, while it's tempting to think of it as just a summer event, the key is remembering its duration: a full eight weeks, not just four.
