Adam Smith is considered the father of modern economics, and his ideas are still incredibly influential today. He lived in the 18th century, a time of great intellectual and economic change, and his most famous work, "The Wealth of Nations," published in 1776, laid the foundation for classical economics. Smith argued for free markets, the division of labor, and the idea that individuals pursuing their own self-interest could unintentionally benefit society as a whole â€“ what he called the "invisible hand." His theories about supply and demand, competition, and the role of government in the economy are fundamental concepts that economists still study and debate. While David Hume was a significant philosopher of the same era, his focus was more on philosophy and skepticism, not economics. James Watt is famous for his improvements to the steam engine, a key invention of the Industrial Revolution, and Howard Florey was a key figure in the development of penicillin. So, while all are important figures, only Adam Smith is primarily known for his lasting economic theories.
