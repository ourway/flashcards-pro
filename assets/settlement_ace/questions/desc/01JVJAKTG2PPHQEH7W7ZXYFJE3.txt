Elizabeth I's reign, spanning from 1558 to 1603, is often considered a golden age in English history. Several factors contributed to her popularity, but the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 was a pivotal moment. Spain, a major European power at the time, attempted to invade England with a massive fleet of ships, the Armada, aiming to overthrow Elizabeth and restore Catholicism. The English navy, aided by stormy weather, successfully repelled the invasion. This victory was seen as a triumph of Protestant England over Catholic Spain, significantly boosting national pride and solidifying Elizabeth's image as a strong and capable leader. It's easy to see why this event made her so popular. The victory was a huge deal, and it really cemented her place in history as a powerful and successful queen. So, the statement is true; Elizabeth did become one of the most popular English monarchs, especially after the Armada victory.
