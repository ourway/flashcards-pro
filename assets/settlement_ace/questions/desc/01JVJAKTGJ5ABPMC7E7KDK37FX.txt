Okay, here's the explanation:

The voting rights of EU citizens in the UK are a bit nuanced, and it's important to understand the specifics. While EU citizens living in the UK *can* vote in some elections, it's not a blanket right to vote in *all* elections. Specifically, they can vote in local elections and elections to the European Parliament (when the UK was still part of the EU). The key point is that they *cannot* vote in UK general elections, which determine who sits in the UK Parliament and ultimately who becomes Prime Minister. These elections are reserved for British citizens, and citizens of Commonwealth countries who have permission to enter or stay in the UK, or who do not require such permission. So, while it might seem logical that long-term residents should have full voting rights, the rules are different for general elections. This distinction is rooted in the idea that electing the national government is a right reserved for those with a deeper connection to the country, either through citizenship or historical ties.
