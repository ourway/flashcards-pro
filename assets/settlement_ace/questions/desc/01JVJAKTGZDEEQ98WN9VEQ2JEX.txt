Okay, let's talk about St. Paul's Cathedral. The original St. Paul's was actually destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, a devastating event that reshaped the city. After the fire, a commission was set up to rebuild London, and that's where Sir Christopher Wren comes in. He was a brilliant architect, scientist, and mathematician, and he was tasked with designing a brand new cathedral. Wren's design was ambitious and incorporated elements of classical and baroque architecture. Construction began in 1675 and took over 30 years to complete, finally finishing in 1710. St. Paul's became a symbol of London's resilience and rebirth. So, while Samuel Pepys was famous for his diary describing the fire, Isaac Newton for his scientific discoveries, and Isambard Kingdom Brunel for his engineering feats much later on, it's Sir Christopher Wren who is forever linked to the architectural masterpiece that is the new St. Paul's Cathedral.
