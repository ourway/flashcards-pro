The UK legal system is structured with different courts handling different levels of crime. Think of it as a hierarchy, with the seriousness of the crime determining which court hears the case. Minor criminal cases, things like petty theft, traffic offenses, or minor assaults, are typically dealt with at the lowest levels. These are the Justice of the Peace Courts in Scotland and the Magistrates' Courts in England and Wales. These courts aim to resolve these issues quickly and efficiently. The Crown Court, on the other hand, handles more serious crimes like murder, rape, and armed robbery. The Coroner's Court investigates deaths that are sudden, violent, or unexplained. So, while the Crown Court deals with major issues and the Coroner's Court deals with investigating deaths, the Justice of the Peace and Magistrates' Courts are specifically designed to handle those less serious, day-to-day criminal matters.
