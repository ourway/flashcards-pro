The River Thames is practically synonymous with London. It's been central to the city's history and development since Roman times. Think of it as London's watery spine, influencing everything from trade and transport to culture and defense. The Thames has witnessed centuries of royal processions, naval battles, and bustling commerce. Many of London's most iconic landmarks are situated along its banks, including the Houses of Parliament, Tower Bridge, and the Tower of London. So, when you picture the London Eye, that giant Ferris wheel offering amazing views of the city, it makes perfect sense that it would be located right next to the Thames. The other rivers, the Wye, Severn, and Trent, are important rivers in the UK, but they flow through different regions and aren't associated with London in the same way. The Thames is the one that truly defines London's landscape and history.
