Mary Stuart, also known as Mary, Queen of Scots, lived a dramatic life filled with political intrigue. After her husband, Lord Darnley, was murdered in 1567, suspicion immediately fell upon Mary. Many people believed she was involved in the plot, perhaps because she had grown to despise Darnley. This suspicion is a key part of the story. Simultaneously, facing unrest in Scotland and needing support, Mary sought assistance from her cousin, Queen Elizabeth I of England. Elizabeth, though related, was wary of Mary's claim to the English throne and the potential threat she posed. So, Mary's plea for help to Elizabeth I is the second event that transpired. She certainly didn't give her throne to Elizabeth; in fact, she was a rival claimant to it! Fleeing to France was also not the immediate action she took, although she did eventually flee to England, seeking refuge, which ultimately led to her imprisonment and later execution.
