Okay, let's break down the Sikh population in the UK as reflected in the 2009 Citizenship Survey. Sikhism originated in the Punjab region of India in the 15th century. Over time, many Sikhs migrated to various parts of the world, including the UK, particularly after World War II due to labor shortages. While the Sikh community has become a vibrant and integral part of British society, it's important to remember that it still represents a relatively small percentage of the overall population. The 2009 Citizenship Survey aimed to capture the diverse religious and ethnic identities within the UK. The survey revealed that Sikhs, while a significant community, constituted approximately 1% of the population at that time. So, while other options might seem plausible at first glance, the survey data specifically points to 1% as the correct figure.
