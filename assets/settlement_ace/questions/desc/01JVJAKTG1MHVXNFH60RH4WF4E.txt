Okay, here's an explanation of why the UK's system of government is indeed a parliamentary democracy. The key here is understanding what that term actually means. A parliamentary democracy is a system where the people elect representatives to a parliament, and that parliament then holds the power to make laws and govern the country. In the UK, we vote for Members of Parliament (MPs) to represent our local areas in the House of Commons. These MPs are the ones who debate and pass laws. Now, it's true that the UK also has a monarch, which might make some think it's not a full democracy. However, the monarch's role is largely symbolic. They are the Head of State, but they don't make political decisions. The real power lies with the elected Parliament and the Prime Minister, who is the leader of the party that can command a majority in the House of Commons. So, while the UK has a monarch, it's the elected Parliament that governs, making it a parliamentary democracy. Think of it as a blend of tradition and modern governance, where the elected representatives are the ones calling the shots.
