Magistrates play a vital role in the UK's legal system, primarily dealing with less serious crimes. What's interesting is that the vast majority of magistrates, also known as Justices of the Peace, are actually unpaid volunteers. This tradition goes way back â€“ the idea was to have ordinary people from the community involved in administering justice. Because they're not legal professionals, they don't need to have formal legal qualifications like a law degree or experience as a solicitor. Instead, they receive training to equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge to make fair decisions. They usually sit as a panel of three, guided by a legally qualified clerk who advises them on the law. So, while some legal experts are involved in the court system, the core of the magistrates' court is made up of these dedicated, unpaid individuals. It's easy to think that because they're dealing with legal matters, they must be highly qualified lawyers, but that's not the case for most magistrates.
