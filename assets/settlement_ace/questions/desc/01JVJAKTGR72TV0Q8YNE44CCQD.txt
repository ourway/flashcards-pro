The Chartist movement, active primarily from 1838 to 1848, emerged from widespread discontent among working-class people who felt excluded from the political process. The Great Reform Act of 1832 had extended the vote, but still excluded a large portion of the male population. The Chartists' demands were outlined in "The People's Charter," a document calling for significant democratic reforms. Payment for Members of Parliament was crucial because, at the time, only wealthy individuals could afford to serve without an income. Allowing any man to stand as an MP challenged the existing system where only landowners and the upper class were considered eligible. The introduction of secret ballots aimed to protect voters from intimidation and bribery, ensuring they could vote freely according to their conscience. While women's suffrage was a later movement, the Chartists focused on male suffrage and broader democratic reforms for men. Open voting was the existing system, which the secret ballot aimed to replace.
