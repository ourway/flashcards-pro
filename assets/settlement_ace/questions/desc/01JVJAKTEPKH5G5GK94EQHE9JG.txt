Roald Dahl is the author of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. Dahl was a British novelist, short story writer, poet, screenwriter, and fighter pilot. He was born in Wales to Norwegian parents, which gave him a unique cultural perspective that often influenced his writing. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', published in 1964, is one of his most beloved works, telling the story of young Charlie Bucket's adventure in Willy Wonka's magical chocolate factory. The book explores themes of greed, honesty, and the importance of family. While J.R.R. Tolkien is famous for 'The Lord of the Rings', Charles Dickens for classics like 'Oliver Twist', and Rudyard Kipling for 'The Jungle Book', none of them wrote 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. Remembering Dahl's name is easier when you connect it with the character Charlie's last name, Bucket.
