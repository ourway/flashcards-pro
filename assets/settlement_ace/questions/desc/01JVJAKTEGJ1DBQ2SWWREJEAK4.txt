The United Kingdom is made up of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. While all contribute to the UK's identity and population, England is by far the most populous. Historically, England has been the dominant force within the UK, both politically and economically, which has led to a larger concentration of people residing there. Think about it â€“ London, the UK's capital and a global hub, is located in England. Major industrial and commercial centers are also primarily based in England. So, while Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have their own distinct populations, cultures, and contributions, England's population significantly outweighs them. Therefore, the correct answer is 84%. It's tempting to think it might be lower, considering there are four countries, but England's historical and economic significance has resulted in it housing the vast majority of the UK's population.
