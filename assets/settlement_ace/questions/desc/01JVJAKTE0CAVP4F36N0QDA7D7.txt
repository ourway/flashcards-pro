Henry VIII's marital life is one of the most talked-about aspects of Tudor history, largely because he had six wives! His desire for a male heir and his strong will led to some pretty dramatic events. The key thing to remember is that two of his wives met a rather unfortunate end: execution. Anne Boleyn was Henry's second wife. He married her after breaking with the Catholic Church so he could divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon. However, he later accused Anne of treason and had her beheaded in 1536. Catherine Howard, his fifth wife, suffered a similar fate. She was much younger than Henry, and was accused of adultery. She was also executed in 1542. The other wives either died (like Jane Seymour, who died shortly after giving birth to his son, Edward), were divorced (like Anne of Cleves), or survived him (like Catherine Parr). So, while Henry's relationships were full of drama, only Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard were actually executed.
