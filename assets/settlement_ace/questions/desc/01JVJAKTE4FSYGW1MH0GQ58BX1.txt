The First World War dramatically reshaped British society, and one significant outcome was the Representation of the People Act in 1918. Before the war, the suffragette movement had been campaigning vigorously for women's voting rights, but progress was slow. However, with millions of men away fighting, women stepped into traditionally male roles in factories, farms, and hospitals, proving their capabilities and contributing significantly to the war effort. This widespread contribution made it difficult to deny them political representation any longer. The 1918 Act granted the vote to women over the age of 30 who met certain property qualifications. While it wasn't full equality with men (who could vote at 21), it was a crucial first step. The other conflicts listed simply didn't have the same transformative impact on the social and political landscape regarding women's rights. The Crimean War was earlier, and the Wars of the Roses were far earlier, before the rise of the modern women's suffrage movement. While the Second World War also saw women playing vital roles, the voting age for women was lowered to 21, achieving full equality with men, in 1928, a decade after the First World War.
