The Roman occupation of Britain, lasting from 43 AD to 410 AD, fundamentally reshaped the island. While their influence touched many aspects of life, one significant contribution often overlooked is the introduction of new plants and animals. The Romans were practical and resourceful, and they brought with them species that would benefit their settlements and economy. For example, they introduced crops like cherries, grapes for wine production, and various herbs that were not native to Britain. They also brought animals such as rabbits, which were farmed for their meat and fur, and various breeds of domestic animals that improved local livestock. While Christianity did take root in Britain during the Roman period, it wasn't solely their introduction, and it truly flourished later. New food and cloth, while partially true, is too broad, and new machinery is inaccurate, as the Romans primarily focused on infrastructure and agricultural improvements rather than advanced machinery in Britain. So, when you think of the Roman legacy, remember the "Roman flora and fauna" that permanently altered the British landscape.
