The Industrial Revolution, which really took off in the UK during the 18th and 19th centuries, was all about massive increases in production and new technologies. Think about it: before factories, most things were made by hand. What changed that? The key was finding a reliable and powerful energy source to drive new machinery. While new economic ideas certainly played a role in shaping the business landscape and medical advancements improved lives, the real engine of this revolution was the steam engine. James Watt significantly improved the steam engine in the late 1700s, making it more efficient and practical. This meant factories could be built anywhere, not just near water sources for watermills. Steam power drove textile mills, powered trains, and fueled ships, transforming transportation and manufacturing. So, while software is crucial today, back then, it was all about harnessing the power of steam to change the world.
