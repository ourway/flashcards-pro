The Laurence Olivier Awards, often simply called the Olivier Awards, are Britain's most prestigious theatrical awards, equivalent to the Tony Awards in the United States. They celebrate excellence in professional theatre in London. The awards are named after the legendary British actor Laurence Olivier, and were established in 1976. Because they focus on London theatre, the annual ceremony is always held in London. Think of it this way: London is the heart of British theatre, particularly the West End, which is world-renowned. Holding the awards anywhere else wouldn't make sense, as the Oliviers are specifically designed to honour the achievements within the London theatre scene. While Edinburgh has its famous Fringe Festival and Manchester boasts a vibrant arts scene, the Olivier Awards are intrinsically linked to London's theatrical heritage.
