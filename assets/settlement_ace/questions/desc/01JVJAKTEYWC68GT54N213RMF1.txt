The title 'Prime Minister' wasn't officially used for many years, so identifying the "first" one is tricky! However, history generally recognizes Sir Robert Walpole as holding that distinction. He served as First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Leader of the House of Commons from 1721 to 1742. While these titles existed before, Walpole effectively consolidated power and became the leading minister in government, advising the monarch, George I and George II. He operated in a way that resembles how modern Prime Ministers function. He was the go-to person for the king, and he led the government's agenda in Parliament. Although he was sometimes referred to as "Prime Minister" during his time, it wasn't an official title. It was more of a nickname that stuck because he was so influential. Later Prime Ministers like Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, and Clement Attlee came much later in British history, long after the role of Prime Minister was formally established. So, while the others were significant Prime Ministers, Walpole is considered the *first* because he laid the groundwork for the position as we know it today.
