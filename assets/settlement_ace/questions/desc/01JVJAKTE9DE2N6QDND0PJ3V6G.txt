Okay, let's break down why Baptists are a Protestant Christian group in the UK. To understand this, we need to go back to the 16th century and the Protestant Reformation. This was a major movement that challenged some of the doctrines and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. Various Protestant denominations emerged from this, each with its own interpretations of the Bible. Baptists are one such denomination. A key belief that distinguishes them is their emphasis on baptism by full immersion, and they believe that only those who are old enough to understand their faith and make a conscious decision to follow Christ should be baptized. This is often referred to as "believer's baptism." While Methodists are also a Protestant denomination, they are not the correct answer in this case. Roman Catholics, on the other hand, are not considered Protestant, as they are part of the original church from which the Protestants dissented. Buddhists, of course, follow a completely different religion altogether, originating in India. So, because Baptists emerged from the Protestant Reformation and have distinct beliefs about baptism, they are correctly identified as a Protestant Christian group.
