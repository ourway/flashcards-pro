The Tower of London is steeped in history, serving as a royal palace, prison, and even a zoo over the centuries. To bring this history to life for visitors, the Tower employs Yeoman Warders, more commonly known as Beefeaters. These aren't just any tour guides; they are ceremonial guardians of the Tower and have all served in the armed forces for at least 22 years. Their distinctive Tudor-style uniforms make them instantly recognizable. Because of their unique role and deep connection to the Tower's heritage, they are the ones who conduct the historical tours. While you might find other guides in London, or imagine history graduates working there, it's the Beefeaters who are specifically known for providing those engaging and informative historical tours within the Tower of London itself. They are a living embodiment of the Tower's past!
