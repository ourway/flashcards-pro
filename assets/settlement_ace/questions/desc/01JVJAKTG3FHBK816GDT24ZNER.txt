Christmas Day, celebrated on December 25th, is a cornerstone of Christian tradition, commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ. Understanding this requires a bit of historical context. Christians believe Jesus is the son of God, sent to Earth to offer salvation to humanity. While the Bible doesn't specify an exact date for Jesus's birth, the 25th of December was chosen centuries later to align with existing winter solstice festivals, making the transition to Christianity easier for many cultures. So, when we think of Christmas, the central figure is always Jesus. It's not just a generic holiday or a celebration of winter; it's specifically about marking the anniversary of his birth. While Easter commemorates Jesus's death and resurrection, Christmas focuses on the Nativity, the story of his birth in Bethlehem. The name "Christmas" itself is a shortened form of "Christ's Mass," further emphasizing the religious significance of the day.
