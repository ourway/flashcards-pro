St. David's Day is all about celebrating Wales and its patron saint, St. David. He was a Welsh bishop during the 6th century and is a really important figure in Welsh history. He founded a monastery in what is now St Davids in Pembrokeshire, which became a significant religious centre. The day to remember him is March 1st. This date is believed to be the anniversary of his death, marking it as a traditional day of remembrance. On St. David's Day, Welsh people often wear traditional symbols like daffodils or leeks, and there are parades and concerts celebrating Welsh culture. You might be thinking of March 17th, but that's St. Patrick's Day for Ireland. November 30th is St. Andrew's Day for Scotland, and April 23rd is St. George's Day for England. So, to remember Wales, think of St. David on March 1st!
