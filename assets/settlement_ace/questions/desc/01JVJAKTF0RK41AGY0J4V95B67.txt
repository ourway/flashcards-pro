The voting age in the UK wasn't always 18. For a long time, it was 21. Think about it: 21 was traditionally seen as the age of adulthood, when you could legally drink and, well, vote! But as the 1960s rolled around, things started to change. There was a growing feeling that if young people were old enough to be drafted into the army and fight for their country, they should also have a say in who was governing them. This led to a lot of debate and campaigning. Finally, in 1969, the Representation of the People Act lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. This was a pretty big deal, giving a whole new generation a voice in politics. So, while 1949, 1959, and 1979 were all important years in British history, 1969 is the one that specifically marks the change in the voting age.
