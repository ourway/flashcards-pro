Boxing Day, celebrated on December 26th, has its roots in charitable traditions. Historically, churches would open their alms boxes – boxes where people donated to the poor – and distribute the contents to those in need on this day. Another theory links it to the Victorian era, where wealthy landowners would give boxes containing gifts, money, and sometimes leftover food to their servants and employees the day after Christmas as a thank you for their year-round service. This act of giving back to the community, especially to those less fortunate, is central to the spirit of Boxing Day. Because of its historical significance and continued cultural importance, it's now a public holiday in the UK, allowing people to spend time with family, continue the Christmas celebrations, or participate in charitable activities. While some might associate the name with the sport of boxing, that's not the origin of the holiday.
