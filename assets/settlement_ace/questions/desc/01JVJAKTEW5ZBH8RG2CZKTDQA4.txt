In the late 1990s, there was a significant shift in British politics with a move towards devolution, meaning the transfer of power from central government to regional bodies. This was largely driven by a desire to give Scotland and Wales more control over their own affairs. For centuries, decisions affecting these nations were primarily made in London. The Labour government, under Prime Minister Tony Blair, held referendums in both Scotland and Wales in 1997, asking the people if they wanted their own devolved assemblies. Both countries voted in favour. As a result, the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament were established in 1999. These new bodies were designed to give the people of Scotland and Wales a greater say in how they were governed, dealing with issues like health, education, and local government. It's important to remember that England already had its central Parliament in Westminster, so there was no need to create an "English Parliament" in 1999. The House of Lords, meanwhile, is a part of the UK Parliament and wasn't a new body created in that year.
