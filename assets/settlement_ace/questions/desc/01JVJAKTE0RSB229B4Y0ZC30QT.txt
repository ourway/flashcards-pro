Imagine medieval Britain, a land already struggling with poverty and hardship. Then, in 1348, a devastating plague arrived, carried by fleas on rats from trading ships. This wasn't just any disease; it was bubonic plague, a highly contagious and deadly illness. The term "Black Death" comes from the dark blotches that appeared on the skin of the infected, a gruesome symptom of the disease. It swept through England, Wales, and Scotland with terrifying speed, wiping out an estimated one-third of the population. Think about that â€“ one out of every three people gone! The impact on society was immense, leading to labor shortages and social upheaval. While the other color options might sound dramatic, "The Black Death" is the historically accurate and widely recognized name for this catastrophic event. It's a term that reflects both the physical symptoms and the sheer darkness of the period.
