Let's delve into the history of shampooing in Britain! Before the modern shampoos we know, the concept of hair washing and massage was quite different. Sake Dean Mahomet, an Indian entrepreneur, played a pivotal role in introducing the Indian art of 'shampooing' – which was essentially a head massage – to British society. In 1814, he opened what is considered the first commercial "shampooing" vapour bath in England, in Brighton. This wasn't just about washing hair; it was a therapeutic treatment involving herbal remedies and massage techniques popular in India. Mahomet's establishment became incredibly fashionable, attracting wealthy clientele. He even became the "Shampooing Surgeon" to King George IV. So, while Richard Arkwright is known for textile inventions, Robert Burns for poetry, and Isaac Newton for physics, it was Sake Dean Mahomet who brought the relaxing and cleansing practice of Indian head massage, or 'shampooing', to Britain, alongside his wife, Jane Daly, making him the correct answer.
