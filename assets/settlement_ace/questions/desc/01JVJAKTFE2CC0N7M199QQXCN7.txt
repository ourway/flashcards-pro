Wimbledon is synonymous with tennis, and it's one of the four Grand Slam tournaments, the most prestigious annual events in the sport. The others are the Australian Open, the French Open, and the US Open. Wimbledon is unique because it's played on grass courts, a surface that promotes a faster game. The tournament has a rich history, dating back to 1877, and is held annually at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in London. The traditions surrounding Wimbledon, like the consumption of strawberries and cream by spectators, add to its distinct character. While the UK is passionate about rugby, cricket, and snooker, Wimbledon is specifically and exclusively a tennis tournament, making that the only correct answer.
