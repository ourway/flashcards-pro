Forced marriage is a serious violation of human rights, and the UK takes a very strong stance against it. To understand why it's a criminal offence, think about the core values of British society: individual freedom and the right to choose your own path. Marriage should be a union based on love and mutual consent. Forcing someone into marriage strips them of their autonomy and can lead to a life of abuse and oppression. The UK government recognized this and, through legislation, made forced marriage a criminal offence. This means that anyone found guilty of forcing someone into marriage can face imprisonment. It's not just about protecting the individual being forced; it's also about sending a clear message that this kind of behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated in the UK. The law aims to protect vulnerable individuals, regardless of their background or origin, and uphold the principles of equality and freedom for all. The idea that it might be permitted or only allowed between cousins is completely false and reflects a misunderstanding of UK law and cultural values.
