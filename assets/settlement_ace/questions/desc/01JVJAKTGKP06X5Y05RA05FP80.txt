Common law in the UK is all about precedent, meaning that judges look to previous court decisions when making rulings on similar cases. Think of it as building a legal system brick by brick, with each judgment adding to the overall structure. This system evolved organically over centuries, starting well before Parliament began passing statutes. So, when a new case comes up, judges research how similar situations were handled in the past. If a previous ruling exists, they'll usually follow it, ensuring consistency and fairness across the legal system. This reliance on past decisions is what makes "following previous decisions" the core of common law. While some laws are written down in statutes passed by Parliament, common law is more about the accumulated wisdom of judicial rulings over time. It's not about juries deciding sentences; that's a separate part of the criminal justice system.
