Okay, let's talk about the Great Fire of London. In 1666, London was a very different place than it is today. Most buildings were made of wood and were crammed closely together. Sanitation was poor, and fire safety wasn't really a thing. Imagine a tinderbox waiting to ignite! The fire started in a baker's shop on Pudding Lane on September 2nd and raged for four days. Strong winds helped it spread rapidly, consuming homes, businesses, and even famous landmarks like St. Paul's Cathedral. While the plague had ravaged London just a year before, and England was often at war, neither of those events were the disaster that struck in 1666. Nuclear power plants didn't exist back then, so that's out too! The Great Fire, though devastating, actually led to improvements in building regulations and city planning, ultimately shaping the London we know today. So, when you think of 1666 and London, remember the flames!
