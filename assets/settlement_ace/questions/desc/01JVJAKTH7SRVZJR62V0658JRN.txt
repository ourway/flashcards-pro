Christmas Day, celebrated annually on December 25th, marks the birth of Jesus Christ and is a cornerstone of Christian tradition. While its religious significance is paramount for Christians worldwide, Christmas has also evolved into a widespread cultural holiday celebrated by many regardless of their faith. The traditions we associate with Christmas, like decorating trees, exchanging gifts, and festive meals, have roots in various pre-Christian winter festivals and customs that were gradually incorporated into the Christian celebration over centuries. For example, the Christmas tree tradition gained popularity in the 16th century in Germany and spread to Britain in the 19th century, largely thanks to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. So, while other holidays occur around the same time of year, like Hogmanay in Scotland, Christmas Day specifically commemorates the birth of Jesus on December 25th, making it the correct answer. Father's Day is a celebration of fathers, and Boxing Day is the day after Christmas, traditionally when servants and tradesmen would receive gifts.
