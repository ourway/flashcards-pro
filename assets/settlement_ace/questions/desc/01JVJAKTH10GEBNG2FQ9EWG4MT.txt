The Battle of the Boyne, a pivotal moment in British and Irish history, took place in 1690. To understand its significance, you need to know it was a key clash in the Williamite War, fought between the Catholic King James II and the Protestant King William of Orange for the British throne. James II had been deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and William, his nephew and son-in-law, took his place. The Battle of the Boyne, fought near the River Boyne in Ireland, was a decisive victory for William. While the war continued for a while after, this battle secured William's position as king and had a lasting impact on the political and religious landscape of Britain and Ireland. It's particularly important in Northern Ireland, where it's commemorated annually by some Protestants. So, remembering 1690 is crucial because it marks this turning point in the struggle for the British crown and the beginning of a new era.
