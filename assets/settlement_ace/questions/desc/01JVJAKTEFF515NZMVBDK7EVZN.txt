Mary, Queen of Scots, had a pretty dramatic life, even before she arrived in England. She was Catholic, and after being forced to abdicate the Scottish throne in favor of her infant son James, she sought refuge with her cousin, Queen Elizabeth I of England. Now, Elizabeth was Protestant, and saw Mary as a threat because some Catholics believed Mary had a stronger claim to the English throne. Elizabeth kept Mary under house arrest for nearly two decades. During this time, Mary became involved in several plots to overthrow Elizabeth. When evidence surfaced that Mary was complicit in the Babington Plot, which aimed to assassinate Elizabeth, Elizabeth felt she had no choice. Despite some hesitation, Elizabeth signed Mary's death warrant, and Mary was executed in 1587 at Fotheringhay Castle. So, while it might be tempting to think she escaped or became Queen, her story sadly ends with her execution.
