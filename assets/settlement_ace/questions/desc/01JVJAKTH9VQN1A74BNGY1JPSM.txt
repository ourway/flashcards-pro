The UK is a constitutional monarchy, meaning the Queen or King is the Head of State, but their power is largely symbolic. The real power lies with the elected government. However, the monarch still plays a vital role in national identity and tradition. When someone becomes a British citizen, they're not just gaining a passport; they're joining a nation with a long history and a specific set of values. The citizenship ceremony is a formal welcome into this national community. As part of that ceremony, new citizens make a pledge. This pledge is a public declaration of their commitment to the UK and its values. Because the monarch represents the UK, new citizens demonstrate their allegiance by swearing an oath or making an affirmation of loyalty specifically to the Queen. It's a symbolic act, but it signifies their acceptance of the UK's system of government and their willingness to uphold its laws and traditions. While sending or signing loyalty might seem like reasonable actions, the formal act of either swearing or affirming is the required demonstration.
