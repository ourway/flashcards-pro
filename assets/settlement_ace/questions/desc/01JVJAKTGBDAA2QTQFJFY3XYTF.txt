The Enlightenment, a hugely influential period in European history spanning roughly from the late 17th to the late 18th century, was all about reason, logic, and individual rights. Thinkers during this time challenged traditional authority and emphasized scientific inquiry and human progress. Scotland, in particular, became a hotbed of Enlightenment thought. Adam Smith, a Scottish economist and philosopher, is famous for his book "The Wealth of Nations," which laid the foundations for modern economics and free-market capitalism. David Hume, another prominent Scottish philosopher, was a key figure in empiricism and skepticism, questioning established beliefs and emphasizing the importance of experience and observation. While Robert Burns was a famous Scottish poet, and Robert Louis Stevenson a novelist, they were not central figures in the philosophical and economic debates that defined the Enlightenment. Smith and Hume were at the forefront of shaping new ideas about society, government, and the economy during this transformative era.
