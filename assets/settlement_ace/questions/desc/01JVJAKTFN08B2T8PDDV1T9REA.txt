British banknotes are issued by the Bank of England, and they come in specific denominations designed for everyday transactions. Historically, the denominations have evolved, but currently, you'll find £5, £10, £20, and £50 notes in circulation. These denominations are chosen to facilitate commerce and provide a range of values for different purchases. While there have been other denominations in the past, like the £1 note which is no longer common, the £25 note has never been a standard denomination issued by the Bank of England. It might seem like a plausible amount, falling between £20 and £50, but it simply doesn't exist in the official series of banknotes. So, if you ever encounter a question about British currency, remember the standard denominations: £5, £10, £20, and £50.
