The Church of England's origins are deeply intertwined with English history. Back in the 16th century, King Henry VIII wanted to divorce his wife, but the Pope wouldn't allow it. So, in 1534, Henry declared himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England, effectively separating it from the Roman Catholic Church. This act of independence is a pivotal moment in English history. Now, the term "Anglican" comes from "Anglicanus," a medieval Latin term referring to England. So, the Anglican Church is essentially the global family of churches that are in communion with the Church of England and recognize the Archbishop of Canterbury as their symbolic head. Therefore, it's perfectly accurate to say that the Church of England is also known as the Anglican Church; they are two names for the same religious body. Some people might think it's false because they associate "Anglican" with churches outside of England, but it's important to remember that the Anglican Communion originated in England and is directly linked to the Church of England.
