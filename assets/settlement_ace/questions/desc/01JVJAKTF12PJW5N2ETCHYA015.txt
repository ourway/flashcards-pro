Before the First World War, which began in 1914, Britain was undergoing significant social reforms aimed at addressing poverty and improving the lives of its citizens. Key among these were the introduction of the state retirement pension in 1908 and free school meals, which were gradually rolled out following the 1906 Education Act. These measures marked a shift towards greater state intervention in social welfare. The state retirement pension provided a safety net for older people, while free school meals aimed to combat child hunger and improve educational outcomes. The National Health Service (NHS), on the other hand, was a much later development, established in 1948 after the Second World War, as part of the post-war welfare state. Similarly, Child Benefit payments, although addressing similar social needs, were introduced even later, in 1975. So, while the NHS and Child Benefit are important parts of the UK's social safety net, they came about long after the First World War, making the state pension and free school meals the correct answer.
