Okay, let's clarify the geographical and political relationship between Ireland and Great Britain. Great Britain is actually a geographical term referring to the island that comprises England, Scotland, and Wales. Think of it as the largest island in the British Isles. Now, the United Kingdom, officially the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, is a political entity. It includes Great Britain *plus* Northern Ireland. The Republic of Ireland, on the other hand, is a completely separate and independent country. Historically, all of Ireland was once part of the UK, but after a long struggle for independence, most of Ireland became the Republic of Ireland in 1922. So, because the Republic of Ireland is an independent nation and only Northern Ireland is part of the UK, Ireland does *not* constitute part of Great Britain. It's a common mistake to assume they're the same, but remembering the geographical vs. political distinction helps.
