Okay, let's talk about walls! When we think about ancient walls in Britain, the most famous one is Hadrian's Wall. This massive structure wasn't built by an English king, but by the Roman Emperor Hadrian, way back in the 2nd century AD. The Roman Empire had conquered much of Britain, but they struggled to control the tribes in what is now Scotland, known as the Picts. Hadrian's Wall, stretching 73 miles across northern England, was designed to mark the northern boundary of Roman Britain and keep those Pictish tribes out. It wasn't just a wall; it had forts, milecastles, and turrets for soldiers to patrol and defend the territory. So, while later rulers like Henry I or Richard II were important figures in English history, they had nothing to do with building this particular wall. And while Donald Trump is known for building walls, his wasn't in ancient Britain! Hadrian's Wall stands as a testament to Roman engineering and their attempts to control the British Isles.
