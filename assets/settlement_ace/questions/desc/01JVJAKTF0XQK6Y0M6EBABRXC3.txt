Alright, let's talk about 1066 and the Norman Conquest. This is a pivotal moment in British history. Before 1066, England was ruled by Anglo-Saxon kings. Now, William, the Duke of Normandy, which is a region in northern France, believed he had a claim to the English throne. When King Edward the Confessor died without a clear heir, William saw his opportunity. He gathered an army and crossed the English Channel, landing in England. The famous Battle of Hastings took place in October 1066, where William's Norman forces defeated the English army led by Harold Godwinson. Harold was killed, and William then marched to London and was crowned King of England. This event is called the Norman Conquest because William was the Duke of Normandy, and his victory led to significant changes in English society, language, law, and architecture. The other options are incorrect because King Alfred the Great lived much earlier and defended England against the Vikings, Julius Caesar led Roman invasions but didn't conquer England permanently, and Harold was the English king defeated by William. So, William the Duke of Normandy is the correct answer because he initiated and successfully completed the conquest of England in 1066.
