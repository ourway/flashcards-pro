British society is built upon the fundamental values of tolerance, equality, and respect for the rule of law. These principles are deeply embedded in the UK's legal framework and cultural norms. Historically, the UK has strived to create a society where people of different backgrounds, beliefs, and lifestyles can coexist peacefully. Allowing extremism and intolerance would directly contradict these core values and undermine the very fabric of British society. Extremism, by its nature, seeks to impose a particular viewpoint, often through coercion or violence, which is incompatible with democratic principles. Intolerance, similarly, fosters division and discrimination, preventing individuals from fully participating in society. Therefore, extremism and intolerance are not acceptable because they actively work against the inclusive and harmonious society that the UK aims to be. While freedom of speech is protected, it doesn't extend to inciting hatred or violence. Some might mistakenly believe that complete freedom means accepting all views, but the law recognizes that certain expressions can be harmful and detrimental to society.
