Okay, so the statement claims that constituencies with virtually no voters were known as 'Pocket Boroughs.' That's incorrect. The term you're thinking of is actually 'Rotten Boroughs.' Before the electoral reforms of the 19th century, the UK's parliamentary system had some serious quirks. Over time, some boroughs, which were areas entitled to elect Members of Parliament, had drastically declined in population, sometimes to the point of having very few voters. These were the 'Rotten Boroughs,' and they were ripe for corruption. Now, 'Pocket Boroughs' were different. These weren't necessarily depopulated, but they were controlled by a single wealthy landowner or family who could essentially 'nominate' the MP. Think of it like having the MP in their pocket! So, while both types of boroughs represented flaws in the system, 'Rotten Boroughs' were defined by their tiny electorates, while 'Pocket Boroughs' were defined by their domination by a single person or family. The Great Reform Act of 1832 aimed to address these issues by redistributing seats to more populated areas and standardizing voter qualifications.
