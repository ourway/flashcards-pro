A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the construction of the Tower of London. The scene is set in the late 11th century, with a focus on the initial stages of the White Tower's construction. William the Conqueror, portrayed as a strong, determined figure in Norman attire, stands centrally, gesturing towards the ongoing work. He wears a blue tunic with gold trim, reminiscent of the UK flag colors. Around him, Norman soldiers and English laborers are actively engaged in building; some are hauling stones with ropes and pulleys, others are chiseling blocks, and some are mixing mortar. The architecture is realistic, showing the early Norman style with thick walls and rounded arches. In the background, the Thames River flows gently, with a few Norman ships anchored nearby, symbolizing William's arrival and conquest. The sky is overcast, painted in soft pastel blues and grays, adding to the solemnity and historical weight of the event. The overall composition is balanced, drawing the eye to William and the tower, emphasizing his role in commissioning the iconic structure. The painting should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and the scale of the construction project.
