A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format. The scene depicts a serene and picturesque view of Cambridge University, focusing on King's College Chapel. The Chapel's Gothic architecture is rendered with precision, showcasing its intricate details and grandeur. Dominating the foreground is a lush, green lawn gently sloping towards the River Cam, which reflects the Chapel's image in the water. On the left side of the frame, an apple tree takes prominence. Several ripe, red apples hang from its branches, and a single apple has fallen to the ground near the tree's base. The colours should be pastel, with the Chapel rendered in shades of light grey and white, the lawn in soft greens, the river in muted blues, and the apples in vibrant reds. The sky is a pale blue with wispy white clouds, suggesting a calm, clear day. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, with the Chapel centrally positioned and the apple tree providing a visual anchor on the left. The style is realistic yet slightly stylized to evoke a sense of timelessness and academic prestige, reminiscent of classic British landscape paintings.
