A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a pastel color palette depicting the Welsh Dragon perched atop a stylized, ancient-looking stone archway that represents the National Assembly for Wales. The dragon, rendered in soft shades of red and white, exudes an aura of wisdom and authority. Beneath the archway, a gentle river flows, symbolizing the flow of laws and governance. The river splits into two streams. One stream flows freely and brightly under the arch. The other stream is partially blocked by a symbolic, oversized, ornate key, representing the UK Parliament's influence. However, the water still manages to trickle through the blocked stream, signifying the Welsh Assembly's ability to pass laws, albeit with some constraints. The landscape surrounding the archway features rolling green hills dotted with traditional Welsh cottages. In the background, faintly visible through a soft mist, is a silhouette of the Houses of Parliament in London. The overall composition is balanced and serene, with a focus on the dragon and the archway as the central elements. The style should evoke a sense of historical importance and the unique identity of Wales within the United Kingdom, with soft colors to create a memorable and educational image.
