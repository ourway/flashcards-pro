A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic style reminiscent of 19th-century technical drawings, set against a soft, pastel-colored background (primarily light blues and creams). The central focus is a cutaway view of a complex steam engine, its brass and iron components rendered with precision. Adjacent to the steam engine, a large, intricate piece of machinery, perhaps a textile loom or a printing press, is depicted with similar detail. Gears, belts, and levers are visible, showcasing the mechanics of the machine. The steam engine is connected to the machinery with pipes and drive belts, symbolizing the power transfer. Subtle steam wisps are emerging from the engine, adding a sense of dynamism. The composition should emphasize the interconnectedness of the steam engine and the machinery, highlighting their transformative impact. The overall aesthetic should evoke a sense of innovation and progress, characteristic of the Industrial Revolution. Use a pastel color palette to soften the industrial feel, ensuring the image remains visually appealing and educational. No text should be present within the image.
