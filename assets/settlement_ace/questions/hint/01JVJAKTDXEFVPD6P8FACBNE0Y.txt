A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, depicting a stylized map of the United Kingdom, predominantly featuring England. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly mirroring the UK flag. England occupies the central and largest portion of the map, rendered in a soft pastel blue. Within England's borders, illustrate a gathering of people - approximately 84 individuals depicted as simple, yet distinct watercolor figures. These figures are diverse in appearance, representing the multicultural population of the UK. The other constituent countries of the UK – Scotland (top), Wales (left), and Northern Ireland (top left) – are represented in muted pastel shades of red and white respectively, appearing smaller and less densely populated. The borders between the countries are softly delineated with thin, dashed lines. The surrounding sea is a gentle wash of deeper blue, creating a sense of the UK as an island nation. The composition should emphasize the size and population of England relative to the rest of the UK, visually reinforcing the concept of 84% of the population residing within its borders. The entire image is contained within a 16:9 landscape ratio.
