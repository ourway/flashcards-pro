A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in watercolor style, depicting Queen Elizabeth II in a scene symbolizing her advisory role to the government. The Queen is seated at an ornate, antique wooden desk in a room reminiscent of Buckingham Palace's interior, bathed in soft, natural light filtering through a large window overlooking a lush, green garden. She is wearing a sophisticated, light blue dress suit with a pearl necklace, and a small, jeweled brooch. Before her stands a respectful, slightly younger male figure representing a Prime Minister, dressed in a dark suit. He is leaning slightly forward, listening attentively to the Queen. The desk is adorned with symbolic items: a partially open book displaying the British constitution, a quill pen resting on parchment, and a small, intricately carved wooden lion, symbolizing courage and leadership. The color palette should be dominated by pastel blues, creams, and golds, reflecting the regal yet gentle nature of the Queen's role. A subtle halo of light surrounds the Queen's head, signifying wisdom and guidance. The overall composition should convey a sense of historical importance, respect, and the ongoing tradition of the monarch's involvement in governmental matters, emphasizing her role as an advisor, warner, and source of encouragement. The scene should evoke a sense of quiet authority and the weight of responsibility.
