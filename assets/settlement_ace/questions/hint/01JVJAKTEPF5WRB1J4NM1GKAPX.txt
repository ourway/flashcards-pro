A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the iconic 10 Downing Street. The focal point is the black door with the prominent number "10" in gold. The door is slightly ajar, revealing a warm, inviting glow from within. In front of the door, on a small, elegant doormat, rests a miniature, stylized figure representing the Prime Minister. The miniature figure is dressed in a smart, dark suit and holds a briefcase. Above the doorway, subtly integrated into the architectural details, are delicate floral arrangements featuring red poppies, white lilies, and blue cornflowers, subtly hinting at the colors of the Union Jack. The brickwork of the building is rendered in a soft, pastel palette of creams and light browns, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The surrounding area features meticulously drawn details of the wrought iron railings and gas lamps, adding to the historic charm of the scene. The sky above is a gentle, pastel blue, with soft, watercolor clouds adding depth and serenity. The overall composition should evoke a sense of history, importance, and the personal residence of a significant figure, encouraging memorization through visual association. The image should be 16:9 ratio, and the door should be in the center of the image.
