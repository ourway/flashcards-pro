A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting the annual rowing race on the River Thames between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. The scene is set on a bright, slightly overcast day, with the Thames reflecting the soft light. Two sleek, classic rowing boats, each carrying a crew of eight rowers, are neck and neck in the middle of the river. The Oxford boat is adorned with dark blue oars and matching team uniforms, while the Cambridge boat sports light blue. The rowers are captured mid-stroke, their faces showing intense concentration and exertion. The background features the iconic architecture of London's riverbanks, including glimpses of historic buildings and bridges, rendered in soft, pastel hues. Spectators line the riverbanks, creating a colourful blur of activity. Small British flags are visible among the crowd. The overall composition is balanced, with the rowing boats as the central focus. The sky is a pale blue, blending seamlessly into the greyish water. The colour palette is primarily pastel, with accents of dark and light blue to represent the two universities. The style should evoke a sense of tradition and history, reminiscent of classic British sporting art.
