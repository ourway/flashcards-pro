A watercolor painting in a realistic style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a hand gently placing a collection of banknotes onto a stylized map of the United Kingdom. The map is rendered in soft pastel shades of blue, green, and pink, representing England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland respectively. The banknotes are a mix of designs, some clearly Scottish (featuring Scottish figures or landmarks like Edinburgh Castle), and others Northern Irish (depicting imagery like the Harland and Wolff cranes or portraits of significant Irish figures). These banknotes are distinctly different in design from a smaller collection of Bank of England notes also present. The hand is depicted in a neutral skin tone, symbolizing inclusivity. The background is a soft, blurred wash of pastel colors, evoking a sense of unity and national identity. The overall composition is balanced and calming, designed to convey a sense of legitimacy and acceptance. The art style should be reminiscent of classic British watercolor landscapes, with an emphasis on delicate detail and soft, diffused light.
