A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour 2D image in a realistic style, depicting a split scene. The left side, bathed in warm, golden hues reminiscent of a vintage map, showcases Queen Victoria regally seated on a throne. Behind her, a vast, stylized world map unfurls, meticulously detailed with miniature ships sailing across oceans, tiny figures representing diverse cultures, and vibrant depictions of territories coloured in British red. The map is demonstrably larger and more expansive than the scene on the right.

The right side, rendered in cooler, muted blues and greys, features Queen Elizabeth II standing gracefully in a modern setting, perhaps a garden in Buckingham Palace. Behind her, a significantly smaller and more subtly coloured map of the world is visible, representing the Commonwealth. The contrast in size and vibrancy between the two maps should be immediately apparent. A symbolic, cracked and crumbling column lies horizontally between the two scenes, signifying the decline of the former Empire. The overall composition emphasizes the historical context, using colour and scale to visually represent the shift in the size and nature of the British Empire over time. The art style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and educational clarity, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements. The colour palette should subtly incorporate the red, white, and blue of the Union Jack, with pastel shades dominating the Elizabethan scene to convey a sense of contemporary restraint.
