A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor image in a pastel color palette (primarily blues, reds, and whites) depicting the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London. The Cenotaph should be the central focus, rendered with meticulous detail to accurately reflect its architectural features and stone texture. The sky behind the Cenotaph is a soft, gradient blend of pastel blues and whites, suggesting a serene and contemplative atmosphere. Flanking the Cenotaph on either side, subtle, almost ghostly, figures of British soldiers from different historical periods (World War I, World War II) are depicted bowing their heads in remembrance. These figures should be semi-transparent, emphasizing their spectral nature and symbolic representation of the war dead. At the base of the Cenotaph, a scattering of vividly red poppies is illustrated, creating a striking contrast against the stone and symbolizing remembrance. The overall composition should convey a sense of solemnity, respect, and historical significance, with the Cenotaph standing as a timeless monument to sacrifice. The perspective should be slightly from below, enhancing the Cenotaph's imposing presence and emphasizing its role as a focal point for national remembrance. The style should be reminiscent of classic war art, maintaining a balance between realism and emotional impact. The image ratio is 16:9.
