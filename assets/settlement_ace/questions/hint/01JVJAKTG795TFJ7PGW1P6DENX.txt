A hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the interior of the Palace of Westminster during a parliamentary debate. The scene should be rendered in a realistic style, capturing the grandeur of the architecture with high ceilings, ornate details, and the characteristic green benches of the House of Commons. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, reminiscent of the UK flag but softened for a gentle, educational feel. The central focus is on the Speaker's chair and the debating floor, where several figures are engaged in discussion. Surrounding the central floor area, in the viewing galleries, are a diverse group of people - families with children, students, elderly individuals, and people of various ethnicities and ages. These individuals are depicted listening intently to the debate. Crucially, some of the people in the gallery should have subtle visual cues suggesting they are not on the electoral register, such as a faint ghostly or transparent effect, symbolizing that their presence is not contingent on their registration status. The overall composition aims to convey a sense of openness and public access to the parliamentary process, emphasizing that anyone can observe the debates, regardless of their electoral registration status. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere.
