A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor illustration in a pastel color palette (dominated by sky blues, creams, and soft reds) depicting Sir Frank Whittle standing proudly next to a cutaway diagram of a jet engine. The diagram should be detailed and scientifically accurate, showcasing the internal workings of the engine, including the compressor, combustion chamber, turbine, and exhaust nozzle. Whittle is portrayed in the style of the 1930s, wearing a neatly tailored suit and tie, and sporting a determined expression. Behind Whittle and the engine, subtly sketched in the background, is a stylized representation of a British airfield, complete with vintage aircraft taking off. A faint, stylized Union Jack flag is subtly integrated into the clouds in the sky. Emanating from the exhaust nozzle of the jet engine is a gentle, swirling pattern of pastel blues and whites, suggesting the powerful thrust being generated. The overall composition should be balanced, with the jet engine and Whittle occupying the central focus, and the background elements providing context and depth. The style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and technological innovation, suitable for educational purposes. The artwork should be realistic, not cartoonish or abstract, and avoid any text or numbers.
