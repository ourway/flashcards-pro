A hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The color palette should be primarily pastel, with subtle hints of red, white, and blue to allude to the UK flag. The central focus is a young girl, around 10 years old, standing confidently in a field of wildflowers. She is wearing a simple, white cotton dress. Her expression is serene and self-assured. Around her, delicate, stylized thorny vines form a protective circle, acting as a visual barrier. These vines are intricately drawn, with small, pastel-colored roses interspersed among the thorns. In the background, slightly blurred to maintain focus on the girl, is a silhouette of the Houses of Parliament against a soft, dawn sky. The overall composition should convey a sense of safety, protection, and the safeguarding of innocence. The wildflowers should be a variety of native British species, subtly reinforcing the UK context. The thorny vines should not appear threatening, but rather as a gentle, natural defense. The art style should evoke a sense of classic children's book illustration, focusing on soft lines and gentle blending of colors to create a reassuring and protective atmosphere.
