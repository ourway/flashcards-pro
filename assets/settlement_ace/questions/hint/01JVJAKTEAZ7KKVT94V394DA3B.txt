A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour illustration depicting the cityscape of Edinburgh, Scotland, during the Fringe Festival. The image should be in a 16:9 landscape format, with the main focus on Edinburgh Castle perched atop a rugged, green hill in the background. The castle should be rendered with realistic detail, showcasing its historic stonework and iconic silhouette. Below the castle, the Royal Mile should be bustling with activity. Street performers, rendered in pastel colours, are scattered along the street: a mime artist with a white face, a musician playing bagpipes, and a group of actors in colourful costumes gesturing dramatically. The architecture of the Royal Mile is distinctly Scottish, with tall, narrow buildings made of grey stone. Banners and flags in pastel shades of red, white, and blue (resembling the UK flag colours) are hanging from the buildings, adding to the festive atmosphere. The sky should be a soft, watercolour wash of pastel blue with gentle clouds. In the foreground, a cobblestone street leads the viewer into the scene, subtly suggesting the viewer is part of the festival crowd. The overall style is realistic and detailed, but with the soft, dreamlike quality of watercolour.
