A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting King Henry VII in his royal attire. He stands centrally in the image, radiating an aura of authority and determination. He is holding a set of scales. On one side of the scale, which is lower, there are symbols representing the common people of England: a farmer with a plough, a merchant with goods, a craftsman with tools. On the other side of the scale, which is raised, there are symbols representing the nobility: a miniature castle, a sword, a noble's hat. The background features a landscape of rolling green hills, a peaceful English village, and a distant, imposing castle on a hilltop, subtly representing the nobles' former dominance. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, with soft blues, greens, and creams dominating the scene, with touches of royal red and gold on Henry VII's attire. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, emphasizing the theme of restored equilibrium and royal control. The light source is soft and diffused, creating a sense of calm and stability, reflecting the peace and prosperity brought about by Henry VII's actions. The image aims to evoke a sense of historical significance and the king's role in shaping the future of England. The illustration should be meticulously detailed, ensuring that each element is recognizable and contributes to the overall narrative.
