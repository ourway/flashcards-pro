A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, depicting St. Patrick's Cross. The artwork should feature a vibrant red, diagonal cross prominently displayed against a pure white background. The cross should be slightly textured to mimic the look of woven fabric, adding depth and visual interest. The overall composition should be clean and uncluttered, focusing solely on the cross and its white field. The red should be a rich, slightly muted shade, reminiscent of traditional dyes. The white background should be a bright, clean white, offering a strong contrast to the red cross. The image should evoke a sense of history and tradition, subtly referencing the cultural significance of St. Patrick's Cross. Soft pastel colours should be used around the edges of the cross to make it blend with the white background. The image should be centered within the 16:9 landscape format, ensuring the cross remains the focal point. The art style should lean towards historical accuracy while maintaining an aesthetically pleasing composition.
