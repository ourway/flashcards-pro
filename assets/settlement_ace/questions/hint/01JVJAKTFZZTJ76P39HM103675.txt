A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a slightly oversized, intricately detailed, and overflowing traditional British money bag crafted from a heavy, textured brown leather. The bag is bursting open, and spilling out are numerous UK banknotes. Predominantly featured are £5, £10, £20, and £50 notes, each rendered with accurate depictions of their respective historical figures and iconic imagery. The colours of the notes should be vibrant and true to life. However, instead of a £100 note, there's a comical yet symbolic representation: a single, enormous, oversized gold coin with the number "100" embossed on it, causing the money bag to tear further. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel shades, with hints of red, white, and blue subtly incorporated to reflect the UK flag. The background is a soft, blurred depiction of the Bank of England, rendered in muted tones to keep the focus on the overflowing money bag. The style is reminiscent of classic British illustrations, aiming for an educational yet memorable visual aid. The light source is positioned from the top left, casting soft shadows that emphasize the texture of the bag and the notes.
