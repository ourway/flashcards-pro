A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting the architectural evolution of Protestant churches in Britain during the Reformation. The image, in 16:9 format, should showcase a progression from simpler, modest meeting houses to more established, yet still distinctively Protestant, church buildings. Centrally placed is a split visual, the left side featuring a humble, timber-framed meeting house with congregants entering, their faces reflecting earnest devotion and the right side showing a more substantial stone church with larger windows and a steeple, but devoid of elaborate ornamentation typical of pre-Reformation Catholic churches. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues and whites, subtly echoing the UK flag, with accents of earthy browns and greens representing the British landscape. The sky above should be a soft, diffused light, symbolizing a new dawn. Include subtle details like open Bibles in the hands of some congregants and the absence of icons or statues within the church interiors to emphasize the Protestants' focus on scripture and simplicity. The overall composition should convey a sense of historical development and the establishment of a distinct religious identity.
