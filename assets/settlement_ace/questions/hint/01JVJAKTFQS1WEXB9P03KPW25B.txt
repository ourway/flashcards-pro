A watercolour-style illustration depicting a sprawling, smoky 19th-century industrial landscape in Britain. Dominating the centre of the 16:9 canvas is a towering brick factory with multiple chimneys spewing thick plumes of grey smoke that partially obscure a pale, overcast sky. In the foreground, a cluster of workers, rendered in muted, pastel tones, are shown toiling wearily. Their faces are smudged with coal dust, and their postures are slumped with exhaustion. A young child, significantly smaller than the adult workers, is also depicted, highlighting child labour. The factory floor is dimly lit, with dangerous-looking machinery depicted in a simplified, realistic style. There are no visible safety guards or protective equipment. The overall colour palette leans towards muted blues, greys, and browns, reminiscent of the UK flag's sombre tones, with occasional splashes of pastel yellows and oranges to represent the flickering gas lamps inside the factory. The composition emphasizes the vast scale of the industrial setting and the vulnerability of the workers. The absence of any regulatory symbols, such as a law book or a government official, reinforces the idea that there were no protections for workers during this period. The hand-drawn style should be realistic, emphasizing the human element and the harsh conditions of the time, avoiding cartoonish or abstract representation.
