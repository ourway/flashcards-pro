A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image, ratio 16:9, depicting a stately, yet approachable, female figure representing the Home Secretary. She stands in the center of the frame, her silhouette echoing the iconic shape of the Houses of Parliament in the background, rendered in soft, pastel blues and greys. She is dressed in a navy-blue, tailored suit, with a subtle red poppy pinned to her lapel. Her expression is one of calm authority and vigilance. In front of her, arranged in a semi-circle, are several figures representing different aspects of the police force: a uniformed police officer, a detective in a trench coat, and a community support officer. These figures are drawn in a realistic style, with attention to detail in their uniforms and expressions, using a pastel color palette of blues, whites, and greys. A soft, diffused light bathes the scene, creating a sense of security and order. The ground beneath the figures is a stylized representation of the UK, with rolling green hills and subtle references to urban landscapes, all rendered in pastel greens and browns. The overall composition should convey a sense of protection and responsibility, subtly emphasizing the Home Secretary's role as the guardian of law and order in the UK. The art style should be reminiscent of classic British illustrations, evoking a sense of tradition and reliability.
