A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a scene in a quintessential British park. The color palette leans heavily on pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag. In the center of the frame, a golden retriever, rendered with lifelike detail, is shown having just defecated on a perfectly manicured lawn. The dog wears a smart, red collar. Behind the dog, a middle-aged woman with short, auburn hair, dressed in a tweed jacket and wellington boots, is depicted with a look of slight embarrassment. She is actively bending down, reaching with a blue gloved hand to pick up the dog's mess with a small, green, biodegradable bag. The surrounding park features classic British elements: a distant view of a red telephone box, a wrought-iron park bench in the lower left corner, and mature oak trees with dappled sunlight filtering through their leaves. A squirrel is perched on one of the branches, observing the scene. The overall composition emphasizes cleanliness and responsibility, with a visual narrative that strongly suggests the act of cleaning up after one's pet in a public space. The style aims for detailed realism, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, to create a memorable and educational visual mnemonic.
