A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a majestic Monarch butterfly perched delicately atop a stylized, simplified representation of a traditional English church steeple. The butterfly, rendered in vibrant shades of red, white, and blue to subtly evoke the colours of the UK flag, has intricate wing patterns that incorporate subtle floral motifs reminiscent of English gardens. The church steeple, painted in soft pastel shades of grey and cream, features a simple cross at its peak. The steeple is set against a backdrop of a gently rolling, green English countryside with a pale blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The overall composition is symmetrical, with the butterfly and steeple positioned centrally within the 16:9 frame. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a peaceful and serene atmosphere. The scene should feel distinctly English, conveying a sense of tradition and natural beauty. The attention to detail is paramount, ensuring that the image is both visually appealing and memorable, serving as a strong visual mnemonic for the connection between the Monarch and the head of the Church of England. Avoid any cartoonish or abstract elements, aiming for a realistic and elegant depiction.
