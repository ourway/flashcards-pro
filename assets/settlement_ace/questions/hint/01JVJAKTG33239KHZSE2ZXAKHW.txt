A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a stylized, interconnected scene representing the categorization of heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, and cannabis as illegal drugs. The central focus is a large, classic red 'Stop' sign, slightly weathered, dominating the middle ground. Radiating outwards from the 'Stop' sign are four distinct vignettes, each subtly illustrating one of the listed drugs, but in a way that avoids glorification or explicit depiction.

To the upper left, a faded, vintage apothecary bottle with a poppy design etched into the glass, suggesting heroin's opiate origin. To the upper right, stylized coca leaves are arranged artistically as a botanical illustration. To the lower-left, three stylized pills with a subtle, abstract "E" design are shown. To the lower right, a stylized cannabis plant is depicted in soft, muted green tones.

Each vignette is connected to the central 'Stop' sign by a thin, faded red line, subtly emphasizing the link to illegality. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with the red of the 'Stop' sign providing a stark contrast. The background is a soft, out-of-focus wash of muted grey and beige, reminiscent of aged parchment, giving the image a historical and educational feel. The style is reminiscent of antique botanical illustrations combined with public safety signage, creating a memorable and informative visual mnemonic.
