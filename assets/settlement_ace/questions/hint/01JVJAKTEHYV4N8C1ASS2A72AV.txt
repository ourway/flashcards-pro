A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, capturing a scene that symbolizes the Hundred Years' War. The image, in a 16:9 landscape ratio, features a central composition of two opposing medieval armies clashing on a battlefield reminiscent of the English countryside. One army bears the English flag, a white background with a bold red cross, while the other flies a banner with the fleur-de-lis, representing France. The battlefield is realistically rendered with muddy terrain, scattered weaponry, and fallen soldiers, but without any graphic content. Above the battlefield, a symbolic representation of time is depicted: a massive, ancient oak tree, its rings prominently displayed, stretching far back into the scene, almost fading into a misty horizon. The tree's growth symbolizes the long duration of the war, with each visible ring representing years passing. The colors are primarily pastel blues, reds, and whites, mimicking the UK flag's palette, along with earthy browns and greens for the landscape. The overall atmosphere is slightly melancholic, reflecting the war's prolonged and arduous nature. The art style aims for historical accuracy while maintaining an educational and visually appealing aesthetic. The sky is overcast, with subtle hints of light breaking through, casting dramatic shadows across the battlefield.
