A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a split scene representing Scotland and Northern Ireland. The left side showcases a Scottish landscape with rolling green hills, a loch reflecting a clear blue sky, and a distant, mist-covered mountain range. Dominating this scene is a stylized thistle, the national flower of Scotland, subtly interwoven with a banknote design. The banknote itself is a muted blue, featuring a portrait of a historical Scottish figure (perhaps Robert Burns or Walter Scott, but not explicitly identifiable) and intricate Celtic knotwork patterns. On the right side, the Northern Irish landscape features the Giant's Causeway, rendered with accurate basalt columns and the turbulent Atlantic Ocean in the background. Here, a sprig of shamrock is similarly integrated into a banknote design. This banknote is a pastel green, adorned with an image of the Harland and Wolff shipyard cranes (Samson and Goliath) and Celtic-inspired patterns. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel blues, greens, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag but softer and more inviting. The composition should be balanced, with each landscape and banknote design occupying roughly half of the frame, drawing the viewer's eye to the unique details of each region's currency representation. The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and emphasizing the natural beauty of both Scotland and Northern Ireland. The lack of text should emphasize the visual connection between the landscapes and the concept of distinct banknotes.
