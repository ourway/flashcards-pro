A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical illustration. The scene is set inside a 15th-century print shop in England. The central focus is William Caxton, depicted as a distinguished man with neatly combed hair and dressed in a long, dark robe typical of the period. He stands proudly beside his printing press, which is crafted from dark wood and adorned with intricate metal details. The press is actively printing pages; some freshly printed sheets are stacked neatly to one side. A quill and inkwell sit on a nearby table. Light streams in from a window on the left, illuminating Caxton's face and highlighting the textures of the paper and wood. The background includes shelves lined with bound books, representing the spread of knowledge. The colour palette should lean towards muted blues, reds, and browns, evoking the colours of the UK flag and a sense of historical authenticity. The overall composition is balanced, with Caxton and the printing press being the dominant elements, conveying the importance of his contribution. No text should be included in the image.
