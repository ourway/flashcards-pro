A watercolour-style landscape depicting the prehistoric village of Skara Brae in Scotland, rendered in a realistic style. The scene is set on a windswept, grassy coastline under a pastel blue and white sky. The stone houses of Skara Brae should be nestled closely together, partially buried in the earth for protection against the elements. The architecture should be visibly prehistoric, with rough-hewn stones and low entrances. Dominant colours should be earthy browns and greys of the stone contrasting with the green of the landscape. In the background, the wild, churning North Sea should be visible, with white-capped waves crashing against the shore. In the far distance, rolling hills of the Scottish Highlands fade into the horizon. The overall composition should emphasize the remote and isolated location of Skara Brae. The light should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of ancient mystery and historical significance. Small details, such as tufts of grass growing on the roofs of the houses and seabirds flying overhead, should add to the realism and atmosphere. The colour palette should be a mix of pastel blues, greens, and browns, with touches of white to resemble the UK flag.
