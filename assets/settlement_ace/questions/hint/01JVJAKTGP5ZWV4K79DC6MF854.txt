A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The scene depicts a serene public park in the UK, perhaps near a Georgian-style building subtly visible in the background. The main subject is a medium-sized, friendly-looking Labrador dog with a glossy coat, happily trotting along a grassy path. The dog is wearing a well-fitted, classic brown leather collar. Attached to the collar is a small, polished metal tag, clearly visible but without any actual text. Instead, the tag features an embossed symbol of a miniature house (representing the address) above a stylized banner shape (representing the name). The owner's hand, subtly rendered and slightly out of focus, holds a leash attached to the dog's collar, indicating responsibility. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades with accents of red, white, and blue subtly incorporated â€“ for example, blooming flowers in the park could be red and white, while a distant bench could be painted a light blue. The composition should focus on the dog and its collar, making it the central point of interest. Sunlight filters through the leaves of the trees, creating dappled shadows on the grass, adding depth and a sense of realism. The overall tone is peaceful and responsible, emphasizing the importance of dog identification in public spaces.
