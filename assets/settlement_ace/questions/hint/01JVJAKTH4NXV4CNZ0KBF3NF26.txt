A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting four distinct, adjacent landscape panels arranged horizontally in a 16:9 format. The colour palette should lean towards pastel shades with subtle hints of red, white, and blue, echoing the UK flag. The leftmost panel represents Scotland, featuring a vibrant scene of a St. Andrew's Day celebration. People are joyfully dancing a ceilidh, clad in traditional kilts, under a clear, azure sky. Thistles are prominently displayed. The second panel depicts Northern Ireland, showcasing a lively St. Patrick's Day parade. Emerald green shamrocks are abundant, and a marching band plays traditional Irish music. The third panel, representing England, shows a serene, almost melancholic scene on St. George's Day. A single, elegant rose lies on a cobblestone street, bathed in soft, diffused sunlight, subtly implying a lack of widespread celebration. People are going to work as normal. The final, rightmost panel portrays Wales on St. David's Day. A small child, dressed in traditional Welsh attire and holding a daffodil, looks wistfully at a distant parade, suggesting that while celebrated, it isn't a public holiday. The composition should emphasize the contrast between the vibrant celebrations in Scotland and Northern Ireland and the more subdued observances in England and Wales.
