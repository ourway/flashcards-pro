A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a Diwali celebration, split into two distinct but harmonious halves. The left half showcases a Hindu family joyfully lighting traditional clay diyas (oil lamps) arranged in intricate patterns on the steps of a colorful, ornately decorated home reminiscent of Indian architecture. The family members are dressed in traditional Hindu attire, with the women in bright saris and the men in kurtas. The background includes a silhouette of a Hindu temple with festive decorations. The right half portrays a Sikh family gathered around a table laden with sweets and traditional Sikh dishes, with a Nishan Sahib (Sikh flag) gently waving in the background. Family members are dressed in traditional Sikh attire, including turbans for the men and modest clothing for the women. They are lighting candles and sharing food, with expressions of warmth and togetherness. In the sky above, fireworks are exploding in a burst of pastel colors – predominantly blues, reds, and whites, mimicking the colors of the UK flag – symbolizing the festive spirit and the triumph of good over evil. The overall composition should emphasize the shared joy and light of Diwali, highlighting the cultural richness and unity of the Hindu and Sikh communities. The illustration should be detailed and realistic, avoiding cartoonish elements.
