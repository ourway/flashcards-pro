A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting two adjacent scenes, each occupying roughly half of the 16:9 canvas. The left side features a stylized contract, visually torn in half, with ink spilling from the rupture. The contract itself is rendered in aged parchment tones, with faded, elegant calligraphy visible. A quill pen lies discarded beside it, hinting at a broken agreement. Subtle shading suggests the weight and importance of the document. Dominant colors on this side are muted browns, creams, and a touch of crimson representing the broken agreement.

The right side portrays a symbolic representation of divorce. Two wedding rings, crafted from gold, are positioned on either side of a single, stylized rose stem. The rose stem is snapped in the middle, with thorns prominently displayed at the break. The rings are slightly tarnished, suggesting the passage of time and the breakdown of the relationship. The background is a soft, pastel blue, evoking a sense of sadness and separation. The overall composition uses a balanced symmetry to visually link the two seemingly disparate concepts of contract breach and divorce, highlighting their shared jurisdiction within County Courts. The artwork should evoke a sense of solemnity and the complexities of legal matters, while remaining appropriate and educational.
