A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style, depicting a scene from the Chartist movement. The colour palette should primarily consist of muted blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the Union Jack, with subtle pastel accents to create a sense of historical depth. The central focus is a group of determined Chartists marching across a rolling, green English countryside under a slightly overcast sky. They carry banners, rendered in a slightly faded, vintage style, with symbolic depictions of scales representing justice and quill pens signifying the written demands for reform. The clothing of the Chartists should reflect the typical attire of working-class individuals from the 1830s and 1840s â€“ simple jackets, trousers, and bonnets. In the background, suggest a distant cityscape with factories and chimneys, subtly indicating the industrial context that fueled the Chartist movement. The overall composition should convey a sense of forward momentum and collective purpose, highlighting the Chartists' campaign for voting system reforms. The details should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract interpretations, to provide an accurate and engaging visual representation of this historical moment. The image should evoke a feeling of determination, historical significance, and the fight for fairness.
