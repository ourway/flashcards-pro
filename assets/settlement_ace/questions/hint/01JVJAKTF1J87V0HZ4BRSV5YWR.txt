A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic watercolor style, depicting a vintage, hand-cranked film projector casting a beam of light onto a slightly aged cinema screen. The projector, predominantly in shades of brass and dark wood, should feature intricate details, including visible gears and a partially unwound reel of film. The cinema screen is slightly off-white, suggesting age, with subtle imperfections in the fabric. Emerging from the projector's lens is a focused beam of light, rendered in soft yellows and oranges, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Within the beam, silhouetted figures of Victorian-era gentlemen and ladies are faintly visible, suggesting they are the audience watching the first film. The background is a darkened, ornate Victorian theatre interior, with plush velvet curtains in a deep red color framing the screen. The overall color palette leans towards warm, muted tones of red, gold, and brown, evoking a sense of nostalgia and history. The composition is centered on the projector and screen, with the beam of light acting as a visual guide, drawing the viewer's eye to the silhouetted audience and emphasizing the historical significance of the event. The ratio is 16:9, landscape orientation. The entire scene should feel authentic and historically grounded, reminiscent of early cinematic experiences in the UK. The primary colour palette should be pastel colours and the entire illustration should feel calm and educational.
