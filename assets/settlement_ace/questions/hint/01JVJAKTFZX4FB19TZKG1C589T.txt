A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, ratio 16:9, depicting four distinct vignettes arranged horizontally across the canvas, each representing a different Protestant Christian group. The overall color scheme leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag. From left to right: First, a scene of a river baptism, with people dressed in simple, historical clothing, standing on the banks of a calm river under a clear blue sky. A minister in white robes gently pours water over a kneeling person. Second, a cozy meeting house with large windows showing a sunny landscape, representing Methodists. Inside, people are seated in pews, some singing from hymnals, bathed in warm sunlight. The third vignette shows a traditional Presbyterian church with a tall steeple, surrounded by lush green fields. A family exits the church, the father holding a bible. The final scene portrays a serene Quaker meeting, with individuals sitting in a circle in a simple, wooden room, radiating peace and contemplation. The background is a soft, muted white, allowing the details of each vignette to stand out. A delicate watercolor wash connects all four scenes, creating a sense of unity and harmony. The artwork avoids any textual elements, focusing on visually representing the diversity and inclusion within Protestant Christian groups.
