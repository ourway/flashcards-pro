A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant celebration of St. David's Day in Wales. The focal point is a young Welsh girl in traditional attire, complete with a tall black hat and a shawl, joyfully pinning a daffodil, the national flower of Wales, onto her chest. She stands in a lush, green field dotted with blooming daffodils. In the background, a quaint Welsh village nestles against rolling hills under a clear, pastel-blue sky. Villagers are seen parading through the streets, waving Welsh flags (red dragon on a white and green background) and carrying leeks, another symbol of Wales. A faint, stylized calendar is subtly integrated into the landscape, with the month of March highlighted by a delicate wreath of daffodils. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades of green, yellow, white, and blue, reminiscent of the Welsh landscape in spring. The composition should evoke a sense of warmth, pride, and cultural richness, capturing the essence of St. David's Day. The image should have a 16:9 aspect ratio, with the main action centered, creating a visually balanced and captivating scene.
