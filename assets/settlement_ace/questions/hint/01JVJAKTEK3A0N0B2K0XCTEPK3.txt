A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic book illustrations, depicting Robert Burns. The image, in 16:9 format, focuses on Burns seated at a rustic wooden desk, bathed in soft, natural light filtering through a window. He is holding a quill pen poised over a parchment, seemingly lost in thought, composing poetry. Burns is dressed in traditional Scottish attire: a tartan waistcoat, a simple linen shirt, and a dark jacket. The background features a rolling Scottish landscape with heather-covered hills and a distant, misty mountain range. A single thistle, subtly placed on the desk, adds a touch of Scottish symbolism. The color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, green, and heather purple, with hints of warm browns in the wood and clothing, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag. The overall composition is serene and contemplative, emphasizing Burns's connection to the Scottish landscape and his craft as a poet. A subtle, almost ethereal glow surrounds his head, suggesting inspiration and the timeless quality of his work. There are no text or numbers in the image.
