A watercolour painting in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant Welsh landscape under a clear, pastel blue sky. The focal point is a field densely populated with bright yellow daffodils, their trumpets facing upwards, basking in the sunlight. The overall color palette should lean heavily into pastel yellows, greens, and blues, reminiscent of the Welsh countryside in spring. In the background, rolling green hills fade into a soft, misty horizon, suggesting the vastness of Wales. A winding stone wall, typical of Welsh rural architecture, meanders through the field, adding depth and perspective. A gentle breeze is subtly suggested by the slight swaying of the daffodil heads. The sun, a pastel yellow orb, is positioned high in the sky, casting a warm, diffused glow over the scene, highlighting the daffodils. The composition should be serene and inviting, evoking a sense of national pride and natural beauty. The art style should capture the delicate details of the daffodils, with careful attention to light and shadow, creating a visually appealing and memorable image. The image ratio is 16:9, with the main field of daffodils centered within the frame.
