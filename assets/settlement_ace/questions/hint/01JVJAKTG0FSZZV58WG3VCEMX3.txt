A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image in a realistic style, depicting a serene, yet subtly stark, Northern European coastal scene. The scene is set against a pale, pastel-blue sky, subtly hinting at the chilly climate. Dominating the center is a traditional longship, its wooden planks rendered with careful detail, sailing on a calm, steel-grey sea. The ship's sail bears a simple, stylized emblem reminiscent of early Jutish symbols, using only shades of muted red. On the shoreline, a small cluster of thatched-roof houses are nestled against a backdrop of gently rolling hills covered in hardy, wind-swept grasses in pastel green and beige. A figure, dressed in simple, historically-inspired clothing of undyed wool (cream and light brown tones), stands on the shore, gazing out to sea. The overall palette should lean towards muted blues, greys, greens, and browns, evoking the Northern European landscape. The composition should emphasize the vastness of the sea and sky, conveying a sense of the Jutes' origins and the challenging environment they came from. The light should be soft and diffused, as if on an overcast day, contributing to the image's overall sense of tranquility and historical authenticity.
