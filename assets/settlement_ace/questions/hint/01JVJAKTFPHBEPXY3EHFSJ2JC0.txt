A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a pastel color palette, depicting two distinct paths diverging from a central point. The central point is represented by a stylized, classic British police helmet resting on a small, ornate plinth. One path, curving gently to the left, shows a quill pen resting on an open scroll, symbolizing a written complaint; the inkwell beside it is subtly shaped like the United Kingdom. The other path, curving to the right, features an open mouth formed by two megaphones placed together at the opening, from which sound waves emanate, visually representing a spoken complaint. The background is a soft, blurred wash of pastel blue, reminiscent of a calm sky. The overall composition should be balanced and serene, suggesting multiple avenues for voicing grievances. The light source is soft and diffused, creating gentle shadows that enhance the depth of the image. The style should evoke a sense of traditional British artistry, with a focus on detailed realism and subtle symbolic elements. The image should avoid any aggressive or confrontational imagery, instead focusing on the concept of accessible channels for expressing concerns.
