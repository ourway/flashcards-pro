A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Stormont Parliament Buildings in Belfast, Northern Ireland, bathed in the soft, pastel hues of a late afternoon sun. The building's architecture is rendered with precision, emphasizing its neo-classical features and iconic dome. In front of the building, visualize a lush green field, subtly shaped like the number '90' when viewed from above. This field is populated by an assembly of stylized, diverse figures, each representing a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly. These figures are dressed in a variety of contemporary clothing, reflecting the diverse backgrounds of Northern Ireland's population. The figures are arranged in a way that suggests a dynamic, yet orderly assembly, perhaps engaged in a lively debate. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel blues, greens, and creams, evoking a sense of peace and democratic harmony. The sky above should be a soft, watercolor wash of pastel blue, with subtle hints of pink and orange near the horizon. The composition should be balanced, with the Stormont building as the central focal point, drawing the viewer's eye towards the activity unfolding in the field below, and the number '90' shape of the field.
