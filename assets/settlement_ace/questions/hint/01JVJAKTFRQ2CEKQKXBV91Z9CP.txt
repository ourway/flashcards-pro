A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format, rendered in a soft pastel color palette of blues, reds, and whites. The central focus is divided into two distinct scenes, side-by-side, within the frame. On the left, a detailed depiction of a classic British police station facade, complete with a traditional blue police lamp above the entrance and a queue of diverse individuals waiting patiently outside the door. The building is constructed from red bricks. On the right, a stately, traditional writing desk sits in a well-lit office. A quill pen rests on top of a stack of parchment, and a half-written letter is visible, sealed with a red wax stamp bearing the crest of a British police force. Behind the desk, a framed portrait of a stern-looking Chief Constable in full uniform hangs on the wall. A gentle light source illuminates both scenes, casting soft shadows and highlighting the subtle textures of the brickwork, paper, and fabric. The overall composition should evoke a sense of order, authority, and accessibility, emphasizing the formal procedures involved in lodging a complaint. The style should be reminiscent of a classic British illustration, with attention to detail and a focus on realistic representation.
