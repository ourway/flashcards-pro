A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour painting in a realistic style, depicting a scene from the Crimean War era. The focal point is Queen Victoria, dressed in a royal blue gown with a white lace trim, standing on a slightly elevated platform. Before her, kneel three soldiers representing different branches of the British military: an infantryman in a red coat, a sailor in a navy uniform, and a cavalry officer in a green jacket. Each soldier displays a visible wound or sign of battle. Queen Victoria is pinning a Victoria Cross onto the chest of the infantryman, the medal rendered with precise detail to showcase its bronze color and distinctive design. The background features a Crimean landscape â€“ rolling hills with a distant view of a besieged city reminiscent of Sevastopol, with plumes of smoke rising. The sky is a soft, pastel blue with hints of pink and orange near the horizon, reflecting the somber yet hopeful atmosphere. The overall colour palette leans towards the colours of the UK flag with the addition of greens and browns of the landscape. The image should evoke a sense of courage, sacrifice, and royal recognition, serving as a visual mnemonic for the Crimean War's association with the Victoria Cross.
