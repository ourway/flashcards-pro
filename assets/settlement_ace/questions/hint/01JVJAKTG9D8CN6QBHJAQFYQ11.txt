A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical paintings, depicting the Battle of Bannockburn. The scene is framed in a 16:9 landscape orientation, with the main action centered. The color palette leans towards the blues, reds, and whites of the Scottish and English flags, subtly muted into pastel shades. At the heart of the image is Robert the Bruce, portrayed as a strong, determined king in shining armor, his face resolute. He wields a large war hammer, not striking a specific soldier, but rather positioned heroically amidst the chaos. Around him, Scottish soldiers, clad in traditional kilts and armor, fight valiantly. Their faces show determination and grit. In the background, the English army is in disarray, some soldiers falling, others retreating. The landscape is a muddy battlefield, with a small stream representing the Bannock Burn. The sky above is overcast, adding to the somber and dramatic atmosphere. Symbolic elements include a Scottish thistle subtly placed near Robert the Bruce and a fallen English banner in the mud, representing Scotland's triumph and the 'bruising' of the English. The overall composition should convey a sense of historical accuracy and the significance of the Battle of Bannockburn in securing Scottish independence. The details in the armor, weapons, and clothing should be carefully rendered, and the expressions on the faces of the soldiers should convey the intensity of the battle.
