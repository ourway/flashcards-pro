A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration depicting a scene symbolizing the Glorious Revolution. The art style should evoke a sense of historical significance and peaceful transition, utilizing a pastel colour palette with subtle hints of red, white, and blue to reflect the UK flag. The central focus is a grand, ornate door representing Parliament, bathed in soft, golden light streaming from above. On one side of the door, a regal but benevolent-looking lion (symbolizing the monarchy) is depicted bowing its head slightly in acknowledgement. On the other side, a group of diverse figures representing the people of England stand tall and proud, holding symbolic representations of law and order like scrolls and scales. The overall composition should emphasize harmony and balance, with gentle, rolling English countryside visible in the background, complete with iconic landmarks like a distant, stylized representation of the Tower of London barely visible on the horizon. Instead of showing explicit violence, the image should convey a sense of peaceful agreement and mutual respect. The sky above is a clear, tranquil blue, further reinforcing the idea of a bloodless revolution. The lion's crown should appear slightly less prominent than the radiant light illuminating the Parliament door, visually suggesting the shift in power. The entire scene should appear calm, dignified, and celebratory, reflecting the 'glorious' and peaceful nature of the revolution and the confirmed power of Parliament.
