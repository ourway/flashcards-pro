A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a resolute Winston Churchill in his iconic pinstripe suit and bow tie, standing against the backdrop of a stylized British flag rippling gently in the wind. Churchill holds his signature cigar, emitting a thin trail of smoke that curls upwards. The scene is bathed in warm, golden light, reminiscent of the wartime spirit. Beneath Churchill's feet, subtle outlines of wartime landmarks like the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben are visible, rendered in soft, muted tones. The color palette leans heavily on the blues, reds, and whites of the Union Jack, with touches of sepia to evoke a sense of history. The overall composition exudes strength, determination, and leadership. Focus on capturing Churchill's determined gaze and posture, symbolizing his unwavering resolve during World War II. The background should not distract from the main subject, but subtly enhance the feeling of British history and wartime resilience. The painting is 16:9 ratio and landscape orientation. The subject and idea should be mainly in the center of the image.
