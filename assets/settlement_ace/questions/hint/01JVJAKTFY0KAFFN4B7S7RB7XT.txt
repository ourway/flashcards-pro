A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, showcasing the hands of a skilled architect, Sir Edwin Lutyens. His hands, weathered yet precise, are carefully unfurling a detailed architectural blueprint of a grand building reminiscent of his work on the Cenotaph or a stately country home. The blueprint itself should be partially visible, revealing intricate details of columns, arches, and symmetrical designs. The background is softly rendered in pastel shades of blue and white, evoking a clear, bright sky above the English countryside. To the left of the hands, a T-square and set of architectural pencils lie neatly arranged, emphasizing the tools of his trade. To the right, a partially completed model of a building, reflecting the style of Lutyens, sits on a drafting table. The overall composition should be balanced and harmonious, with a focus on the textures of the paper, the delicate linework of the blueprint, and the subtle interplay of light and shadow on Lutyens's hands. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel blues, creams, and whites, accented with muted reds and browns in the wood of the drafting table and the pencils, creating a sense of timeless elegance and architectural precision. The illustration should emphasize the subject matter, which is architecture, and the realistic style will help users remember the correct answer. The image ratio is 16:9, and the main subject and idea are mainly in the center of the image.
