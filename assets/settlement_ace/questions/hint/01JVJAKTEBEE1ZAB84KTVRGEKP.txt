A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the iconic Grand National horse race. The scene is framed in a 16:9 landscape orientation, with the main action concentrated in the central area. The artwork features a line of horses and jockeys leaping over a challenging Aintree fence, complete with meticulously rendered details of the water jump. The horses are a variety of breeds and colors, their muscles taut and glistening. The jockeys are dressed in vibrant racing silks, their faces focused and determined. Splashes of mud and water create a sense of dynamic movement. The background showcases the Aintree Racecourse, with a crowd of spectators blurred in the distance, their silhouettes suggesting excitement and anticipation. The sky is overcast, typical of the UK weather, with subtle gradations of grey and white. The color palette should subtly incorporate the colors of the UK flag â€“ reds in the jockey's silks, whites in the fence posts, and blues in the overcast sky. The overall mood is one of exhilarating competition and the rich history of British horse racing. The image should evoke a sense of movement, speed, and the unique atmosphere of the Grand National.
