A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a game of musical chairs set in front of the Houses of Parliament. Five chairs are arranged in a circle, draped with miniature Union Jack flags. Six figures, each representing a different political party leader, are depicted walking around the chairs with anticipation. The figures are dressed in smart attire, suggesting a formal setting. One figure, slightly ahead of the others, has a concerned look on their face, as if anticipating the music to stop. The style should be realistic but with a touch of whimsy, avoiding cartoonish exaggeration. The Houses of Parliament in the background are rendered in soft, pastel blues and greys, with the iconic clock tower prominently displayed. The overall color palette should be reminiscent of the UK flag, with subtle reds, whites, and blues, but leaning towards pastel shades to create a calming and educational atmosphere. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of anticipation and transition. The composition should emphasize the circular movement of the figures and the central placement of the chairs, symbolizing the fluidity of the Prime Minister's position.
