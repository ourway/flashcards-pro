A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a slightly tilted, aged parchment scroll floating gently above the Houses of Parliament, with Westminster Bridge subtly visible in the background. The scroll, representing the Bill of Rights, appears incomplete and faded around its edges, suggesting it's an imperfect or outdated version. A quill pen lies discarded at the base of the scroll, hinting at unfinished business. The Houses of Parliament are rendered with careful architectural accuracy, their stone bathed in the soft, diffused light of a late afternoon. Instead of being a vibrant blue, the sky adopts a muted, pastel blue tone. A single, prominent crack runs vertically down the center of the scroll, symbolizing a flaw or error in the document's dating. The composition is centered, with the scroll and Parliament dominating the frame. The color palette leans toward pastel hues of blue, beige, and grey, evoking a sense of historical distance and slight uncertainty. The overall mood is one of quiet contemplation and subtle error, designed to remind the viewer of the incorrect date associated with the Bill of Rights in the question.
