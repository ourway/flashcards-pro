A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, set against a soft, pastel sky. The central focus is a meticulously detailed Wimbledon tennis court, bathed in gentle sunlight. A pristine white tennis net stretches across the middle of the court, casting a delicate shadow. On one side of the net, a tennis racket rests casually against a stack of bright yellow tennis balls. The racket's handle is wrapped in a navy-blue grip. On the opposite side of the net, instead of a tennis racket, there is a discarded checkered flag lying on the ground. Over the flag is a single muddy tennis ball, as if it were carelessly thrown there. In the background, spectators dressed in light, summery clothing watch the game intently, their faces blurred to maintain focus on the court. The composition should evoke a sense of tranquility and the quintessential English summer. The color palette should be dominated by Wimbledon's classic green and white, accented with pastel shades of blue, yellow, and rose to give a soft, educational feel. The overall image should be clean, uncluttered, and instantly recognizable as Wimbledon, subtly emphasizing the contrast between the tennis court and the misplaced racing flag.
