A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a sturdy oak tree, its roots deeply embedded in British soil. The tree's trunk is partially split, revealing healthy, vibrant new growth emerging from within. This new growth is depicted as blossoming white flowers tinged with pastel blue and red at the edges of the petals, subtly referencing the UK flag. Around the base of the tree, discarded parchment scrolls and broken stone tablets lay scattered, symbolizing the rejection of old doctrines. Sunlight streams down from the upper left corner, illuminating the new growth and casting long, soft shadows that create depth and contrast. In the background, a faint, stylized silhouette of a cathedral can be seen, its spires reaching towards the sky, but partially obscured by mist. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with dominant blues, reds and whites in the flowers, and earthy greens and browns in the tree and ground, creating a serene and hopeful atmosphere. The composition emphasizes the contrast between the decaying old order and the flourishing new belief system, symbolizing the birth of Protestantism from the Reformation.
