A detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic British educational posters, depicting a grand, ornate European building, subtly inspired by the Palais de l'Europe in Strasbourg, but clearly fictional. The building is bathed in soft, pastel blues and whites, with touches of muted red in the flags gently waving outside. Instead of legislative gavels and official documents, the central focus is a large, symbolic, intricately detailed quill pen resting on an open book displaying images representing human rights, democracy, and the rule of law â€“ a stylized scales of justice, a voting booth, and intertwined hands. Around the building, figures representing diverse European cultures are depicted engaged in peaceful activities: a musician playing a stringed instrument, a group discussing ideas, and children planting trees. These figures are intentionally non-uniform, showcasing the diversity the Council of Europe seeks to uphold. The composition should emphasize the building's role as a center for discussion and promotion, not legislation. There are no harsh lines or shadows, contributing to a feeling of peaceful collaboration. The overall impression should be one of advocacy and promotion rather than enforcement or authority.
