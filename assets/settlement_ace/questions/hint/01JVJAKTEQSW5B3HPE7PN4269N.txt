A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a once-bustling shipyard now fallen into disuse during the Great Depression. The colour palette should lean towards muted blues, greys, and browns, reminiscent of a melancholic maritime scene. The central focus is a large, half-finished ship on a slipway, its wooden frame exposed and weathered, suggesting halted construction. Rust stains streak down the hull, and seaweed clings to the lower sections, implying neglect and time. Around the ship, the yard is sparsely populated, with only a few figures visible. One or two workers are sitting despondently on crates, heads bowed, while another gazes forlornly out to sea. Tools lie scattered and unused on the ground. In the background, a few skeletal cranes stand motionless against a cloudy, overcast sky. The sea in the distance is choppy and grey, mirroring the economic turmoil. The overall atmosphere should be one of stagnation and decay, highlighting the impact on shipbuilding. The style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and emotional depth, avoiding any modern elements and focusing on the period details of the 1930s. The sky should be overcast.
