A meticulously detailed, realistic, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the Elizabeth Tower (formerly known as the Clock Tower) at the Houses of Parliament in London. The tower should be centrally positioned, showcasing its neo-Gothic architectural features with accuracy. The colour palette should feature pastel shades of blue and white, subtly echoing the UK flag, with touches of gold to highlight the clock face and architectural details. The clock face should be prominently displayed, its hands indicating a time around midday, casting a soft shadow. Emanating outwards from the clock face are gently rippling sound waves, subtly suggesting the bell's chime, rendered in a lighter shade of blue that fades into the sky. The sky itself should be a soft, watercolour wash of blues and whites, suggesting a partly cloudy day. Below the tower, the Houses of Parliament should be partially visible, rendered in less detail to maintain focus on the tower. Around the base of the tower, depict a scattering of stylized, pastel-colored forget-me-not flowers, subtly representing remembrance and the historical significance of the landmark. The overall impression should be one of serene grandeur and historical weight, designed to evoke a sense of familiarity and prompt recollection of the bell's name.
