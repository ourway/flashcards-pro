A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting a fleet of imposing galleons sailing on a turbulent, deep blue sea. The ships, rendered in realistic detail, feature prominent Spanish flags emblazoned with the royal coat of arms of Spain, their red and gold colors vividly contrasting against the sky. The lead galleon is slightly larger and more ornate, suggesting it's the flagship. Above the ships, a dramatic, stormy sky filled with swirling gray and white clouds hints at the challenges faced by the Armada. Subtle details include the intricate rigging of the ships, the cresting waves of the sea, and the determined expressions on the faces of tiny sailors visible on deck. The overall composition emphasizes the scale and ambition of the Spanish Armada, while the watercolor style lends a historical and artistic feel. The sun is partially obscured by the clouds, casting a dramatic light on the scene, highlighting the ships and the Spanish flags. The color palette primarily consists of blues, grays, reds, and golds, evoking both the maritime setting and the Spanish national colors. The image should convey a sense of historical significance and the power of the Spanish empire at the time.
