A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting a scene from Iron Age Britain. The image, in 16:9 format, centers on a wizened, yet strong, Celtic Druid seated beneath a sprawling, ancient oak tree. The Druid, adorned with woven green robes and a bronze torc around his neck, is gesturing emphatically with his hands as he narrates a tale. Around him, a small group of Iron Age people, dressed in simple woolen tunics and trousers dyed with earthy tones, are gathered, their faces illuminated by the warm glow of a nearby fire. The firelight casts long, dancing shadows that add depth and mystique to the scene. The oak tree's branches reach towards the sky, its leaves painted in shades of emerald and gold, symbolizing wisdom and longevity. In the background, rolling hills of the British countryside stretch towards the horizon, dotted with Iron Age roundhouses constructed from wattle and daub. The overall color palette leans towards pastel greens, blues, and browns, reminiscent of the UK's natural landscape, with subtle hints of red in the firelight to evoke warmth and storytelling. The art style is realistic, focusing on accurate depictions of Iron Age clothing, tools, and architecture, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements to ensure educational clarity. The composition is designed to draw the eye towards the Druid, emphasizing his role as the central figure and the voice of the Celtic language.
