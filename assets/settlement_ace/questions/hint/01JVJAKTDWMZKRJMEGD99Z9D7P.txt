A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic botanical illustrations, on a 16:9 landscape canvas. The central focus is a large, exquisitely rendered diamond, sparkling with refracted light that casts subtle rainbows onto the surrounding surface. The diamond is not a typical cut; instead, it's shaped subtly like the outline of the British Isles, a clever visual pun. Embedded within the "diamond-island," are tiny, detailed vignettes: a miniature Balmoral Castle, a wisp of Scottish heather, a Welsh daffodil, and the white cliffs of Dover. The diamond rests on a velvet cushion, predominantly royal blue with subtle crimson and white threads woven into an intricate pattern that hints at the Union Jack without explicitly forming the flag. Soft, pastel hues dominate the color palette: pale blues, gentle pinks, and creamy whites, with hints of gold reflecting off the diamond's facets. The backdrop is a soft, diffused light, as if emanating from a stained-glass window, casting a gentle glow that highlights the diamond's brilliance and the delicate details of the surrounding elements. The overall composition should evoke a sense of history, tradition, and enduring strength, mirroring the significance of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee.
