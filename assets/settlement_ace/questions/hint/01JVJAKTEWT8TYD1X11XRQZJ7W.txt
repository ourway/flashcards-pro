A serene, hand-drawn watercolour landscape depicting the rolling green hills of the English countryside under a pastel blue sky. In the foreground, on the left side of the image, a meticulously detailed roundhouse with a thatched roof stands nestled amongst wildflowers. The roundhouse is built from natural materials, blending seamlessly with its surroundings. To the right, a round barrow, a burial mound covered in lush green grass, mirroring the shape of the roundhouse, sits prominently. Positioned slightly behind the round barrow, casting a soft shadow, is an ancient oak tree, its branches reaching towards the sky, symbolizing history and longevity. The colours should follow a pastel palette, predominantly greens and blues, with touches of earthy browns for the roundhouse and barrow. The composition should be balanced, drawing the eye towards the visual connection between the roundhouse and the round barrow. The overall style should be realistic and detailed, reminiscent of a classic English landscape painting, creating a sense of tranquility and historical depth.
