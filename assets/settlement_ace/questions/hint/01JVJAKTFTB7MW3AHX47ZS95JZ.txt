A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style (not cartoonish or abstract), depicting a vibrant and noble Welsh dragon perched atop a craggy mountain peak in Snowdonia National Park, Wales. The dragon, rendered in shades of deep crimson and gold, is the focal point. Around its neck, it wears a regal coronet embedded with emeralds. The mountain is bathed in the soft, golden light of dawn, with mist swirling gently around its base. In the foreground, nestled within a patch of lush green grass dotted with daffodils (the national flower of Wales), lies a single, exquisitely crafted Prince's feather, rendered in delicate shades of white and gold. The sky above is a gradient of pastel blues and pinks, reminiscent of a serene morning. The composition should emphasize the dragon's strength and majesty, while also hinting at the delicate responsibility it carries as a symbol. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, punctuated by the bold red of the dragon and the gold accents, subtly evoking the colors of the UK flag. The background should feature rolling hills and valleys, characteristic of the Welsh landscape, creating a sense of depth and grandeur. The image should convey a sense of history, tradition, and the enduring connection between the Prince and the land of Wales. The aspect ratio is 16:9, with the main elements centered within the frame.
