A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical tapestry or medieval manuscript illumination. The image is set against a soft, parchment-toned background. The central focus features two stylized heraldic roses: one predominantly crimson red and the other pure white. The red rose, depicted with velvety petals and subtle shading to convey depth, is slightly positioned to the left. The white rose, equally detailed, is placed to the right. Both roses are in full bloom, symbolizing the peak of the conflict. Below each rose, intertwining thorny vines extend towards each other but do not fully connect, representing the ongoing conflict and separation between the houses. The vines are coloured in muted greens and browns, providing a natural contrast to the vibrant roses. The composition is symmetrical, emphasizing the equal standing and opposition of the two houses. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues of red, white, and green, evoking a sense of history and nobility. The style is clean and precise, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements. The image should be visually appealing and easy to understand, serving as a memorable reminder of the House of Lancaster (red rose) and the House of York (white rose). The image ratio is 16:9.
