A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Eden Project in Cornwall. The artwork centers around the two iconic biomes, resembling large, interconnected geodesic domes, nestled within a reclaimed china clay pit. The domes should be transparent enough to reveal the lush, diverse plant life thriving inside â€“ a miniature rainforest in one and a Mediterranean landscape in the other. Around the biomes, illustrate the undulating, green Cornish landscape, with hints of the rugged coastline in the background. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades, with a focus on greens, blues, and earthy tones, subtly incorporating the red and white of the UK flag through flower choices and the color of the soil. In the foreground, subtly depict a stylized cornucopia overflowing with various plants and flowers, representing the 'corn' element of Cornwall, subtly blending into the natural landscape. The composition should emphasize the harmonious integration of the modern architecture with the natural environment, capturing the essence of the Eden Project as a symbol of sustainability and botanical diversity in the UK. The sky should be a soft, watercolour wash of light blue with gentle, wispy clouds.
