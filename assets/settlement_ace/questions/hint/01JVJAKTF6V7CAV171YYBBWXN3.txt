A watercolour-style 2D image in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a diverse group of people standing in a stylized, simplified version of the Houses of Parliament. The architecture is recognisable but rendered in soft pastel colours â€“ primarily blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the Union Jack. The central figure is an individual standing slightly apart from two distinct groups on either side. These two groups are loosely arranged and coloured to subtly suggest the traditional colours associated with the UK's main political parties (e.g., blue and red). The central figure, the "independent," is dressed in neutral colours and holds a small, symbolic, uncoloured flag representing their independent status. This flag could feature a simple, universally understood symbol of independence, such as a white dove or a single star. The background should subtly fade, focusing attention on the figures. The overall style should be realistic but with a gentle, educational feel, avoiding harsh lines or overly detailed facial features. The composition should emphasise the central figure's separation and unique position within the broader political landscape, conveying the idea of independence within a structured system. The image should avoid any suggestion of conflict or negativity, instead promoting the concept of diverse representation.
