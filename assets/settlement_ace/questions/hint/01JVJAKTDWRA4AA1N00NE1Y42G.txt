A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a portrait of David Hume, depicted not as a stern historical figure, but as an approachable, contemplative scholar. He is seated in a stylized study, bathed in soft, diffused natural light filtering through a window. His clothing is rendered in muted, pastel blues and creams, evoking a sense of serenity and wisdom. The background includes bookshelves filled with leather-bound volumes, hinting at his extensive knowledge and philosophical depth. A quill pen rests in his hand, poised above a partially written manuscript titled with symbolic representations of human figures intertwined, suggesting his writings on human nature. The composition leans towards a slightly idealized, almost reverential portrayal, emphasizing his enduring influence. Subtle details, such as a faint smile playing on his lips and the gentle crinkling around his eyes, convey his humanity and intellectual curiosity. The overall color palette consists of soft blues, creams, and gentle earth tones, reminiscent of the Scottish landscape and the understated elegance of the Enlightenment period. The art style should evoke the feeling of a classical painting, but with a light, modern touch that makes it accessible and engaging for contemporary viewers.
