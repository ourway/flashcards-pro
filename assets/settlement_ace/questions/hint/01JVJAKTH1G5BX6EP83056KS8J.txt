A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a serene, stylized English countryside scene, symbolizing resolution and fairness. The central focus is a split image: on the left, a quaint, thatched-roof cottage representing 'individual A', and on the right, a modern office building symbolizing 'organization B'. A winding, pastel-blue river (resembling the color of the UK flag) flows between them, visually separating yet connecting the two entities. Above the river, a balanced set of scales, rendered in soft gold, hangs suspended, subtly suggesting justice and impartiality. Delicate pastel-colored flowers bloom along the riverbanks, adding a touch of tranquility and highlighting the peaceful resolution sought in civil disputes. The sky is a gentle gradient of pastel blues and pinks, creating a calming and non-confrontational atmosphere. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, reinforcing the idea of fair resolution. The style should evoke classic English landscape paintings, emphasizing realism and detail without appearing overly busy or cluttered.
