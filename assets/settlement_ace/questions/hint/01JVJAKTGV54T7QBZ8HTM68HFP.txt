A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image in a realistic style, depicting two distinct scenarios side-by-side, divided by a subtle, vertical line. On the left side, a diverse group of people, rendered in pastel skin tones, are walking together in a park with a backdrop of a blue sky. One person is being pushed away by another person with a hateful expression. The hateful person is wearing a dark jacket. This scene should evoke feelings of sadness and injustice. On the right side, a shop with a traditional British storefront is depicted. Inside, a young person who looks under 18 is reaching for a pack of cigarettes on the counter, while the shopkeeper is handing it over with a neutral expression. The cigarette package should be red and white, reminiscent of the colors of the UK flag. The overall palette should be pastel, with hints of red, white, and blue strategically placed within the composition to subtly represent the UK. The composition should draw the viewer's eye to the expressions and interactions in both scenes, highlighting the injustice and potential harm. The art style should lean towards realism to ensure clarity and convey the seriousness of the subject matter. The background should be blurred to keep the focus on the main actions.
