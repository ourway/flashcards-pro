A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a vibrant, mountainous landscape representing Wales. Dominating the center of the image is a proud Welsh Dragon, its scales rendered in shades of deep red and emerald green, standing atop the highest peak. The dragon is breathing a plume of white smoke that curls into the shape of a defiant Welsh flag. Below the mountains, a clear, flowing river winds through the valley. On one side of the river, depicting the Anglo-Saxon, there's a small, orderly village with thatched-roofed houses, rendered in muted browns and greys, with Anglo-Saxon banners. On the other side, representing Wales, is a more rugged landscape with ancient stone structures and Celtic knotwork patterns subtly etched into the rocks. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades of green, blue, and red, reminiscent of the Welsh landscape and flag, creating a visually appealing and memorable image. The composition should emphasize the dragon's dominance and the clear separation between the Anglo-Saxon village and the Welsh landscape, symbolizing Wales' independence from Anglo-Saxon rule. The style should be realistic enough to convey the rugged beauty of Wales, while the watercolor technique adds a touch of artistic flair.
