A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D landscape in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic watercolour illustrations. The image, in a 16:9 ratio, features a split composition, centrally focused. On the left, Edinburgh Castle is perched dramatically atop a rugged, volcanic crag. The castle is rendered with careful attention to architectural detail, showcasing its stone walls, towers, and battlements under a slightly overcast sky. Tiny figures dressed as medieval knights stand guard, their armour gleaming faintly. To the right, Lincoln Cathedral rises majestically from a gentle, green landscape. Its towering spires and intricate Gothic architecture are meticulously depicted. Within the cathedral grounds, miniature figures of monks in traditional robes are seen in quiet contemplation. The colour palette leans towards pastel blues, greys, and greens, with touches of muted red and gold to subtly evoke the colours of the UK flag and to enhance the historical atmosphere. The overall artistic style is educational and engaging, designed to create a memorable visual association between the two buildings and the Middle Ages. The image avoids any text, relying solely on visual elements to convey the information.
