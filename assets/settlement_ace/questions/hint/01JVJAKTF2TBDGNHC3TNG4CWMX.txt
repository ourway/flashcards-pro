A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a somber scene set against the backdrop of the Irish countryside. The scene centers on a weathered, ancient stone Celtic cross, partially overgrown with ivy, standing prominently in a field of emerald green. Dark, heavy clouds fill the sky, casting long shadows across the landscape, evoking a sense of historical weight and sorrow. At the base of the cross, scattered and faded lilies and other wildflowers serve as offerings, hinting at remembrance and mourning. A spectral, translucent figure of Oliver Cromwell, rendered in muted grey and blue tones, stands slightly behind and to the left of the cross, his expression unreadable, his form suggesting a haunting presence rather than a solid figure. He's dressed in period-appropriate attire - dark, simple clothing befitting his Puritan beliefs, devoid of ornamentation. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades of green, grey, and blue, with subtle hints of red in the fading flowers, subtly referencing the UK flag without being overt. The composition should emphasize the cross as a symbol of Irish heritage and the looming figure of Cromwell as a representation of a complex and controversial historical impact. The style should be reminiscent of historical paintings, aiming for a visual representation that evokes contemplation and reflection.
