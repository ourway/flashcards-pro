A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting the three countries that form Great Britain: England, Scotland, and Wales. The composition is centered, filling the 16:9 landscape ratio. England is represented by a lush, green field with rolling hills, a classic thatched-roof cottage nestled amongst the trees, and sheep grazing peacefully. A winding path leads towards a medieval castle in the distance, symbolizing England's rich history. Scotland is depicted as a rugged, mountainous landscape with a deep blue loch reflecting the sky. A lone bagpiper stands on a rocky outcrop, clad in traditional tartan, playing a mournful tune. A majestic stag stands nearby, representing the Scottish Highlands. Wales is visualized as a verdant valley with steep, slate-covered hills. A traditional Welsh dragon, rendered in vibrant red, perches atop a hill, overlooking a small village with colorful houses. A choir practices in a stone chapel, symbolizing Wales' strong choral tradition. The color palette should evoke the UK flag, with shades of red, white, and blue subtly integrated into the landscape and details. The sky above is a soft, pastel blue, with fluffy white clouds drifting lazily across. Light should be diffused and natural, creating a sense of peace and tranquility. The overall style should be reminiscent of classic British landscape paintings, with a focus on detail and accuracy.
