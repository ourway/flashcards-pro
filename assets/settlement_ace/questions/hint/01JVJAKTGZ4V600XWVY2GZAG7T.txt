A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, resembling a watercolor painting, aspect ratio 16:9. The central focus is a grand, circular table positioned in the middle of the image. Around the table sit diverse figures representing various European nations, each holding documents, and engaging in animated discussions. The table is made of dark wood with intricate carvings, and a large, ornate quill sits unused in an inkwell at the table's center. Radiating outwards from the table are numerous scrolls depicting conventions and charters. These scrolls are rolled out and slightly unfocused, suggesting their widespread influence but lack of direct legislative power. In the background, subtly blurred, is the iconic silhouette of the Houses of Parliament, symbolizing legislative authority, but clearly separate and distinct from the central scene. The colour palette should primarily consist of pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly reminiscent of the UK flag, creating a calming and educational atmosphere. The overall composition emphasizes the collaborative and discursive nature of the Council of Europe, contrasting it with the direct law-making power symbolized by the distant Parliament. The lighting is soft and diffused, highlighting the detailed expressions of the figures and the intricate details of the scrolls, ensuring clarity and visual appeal. The image should evoke a sense of thoughtful deliberation and advisory influence rather than decisive legislative action.
