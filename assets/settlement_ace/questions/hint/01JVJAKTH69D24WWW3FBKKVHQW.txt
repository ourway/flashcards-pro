A watercolour-style illustration depicting a stylized, pastel-coloured factory scene in the UK. The factory's architecture includes subtle nods to British industrial heritage, such as Victorian-era brickwork and tall chimneys emitting soft, pastel-coloured smoke. Inside the factory, simplified depictions of workers (gender-neutral and diverse in appearance) are shown at their workstations, with pastel-coloured light bulbs hanging above. Radiating from each worker is a fine, almost invisible, thread that connects to a central, oversized, stylized piggy bank sitting on a desk in a manager's office. The piggy bank is predominantly white with faint pastel blue and red stripes, reminiscent of the Union Jack. The manager, depicted as a friendly, approachable figure with glasses and a welcoming smile, is shown placing a small, stylized key into the piggy bank. This action symbolizes the automatic deduction of income tax. The background includes a subtle gradient of pastel blues and pinks to create a soft and approachable atmosphere. The overall composition focuses on the central connection between the workers, the employer (represented by the manager), and the piggy bank, visually representing income tax being deducted before the workers receive their pay.
