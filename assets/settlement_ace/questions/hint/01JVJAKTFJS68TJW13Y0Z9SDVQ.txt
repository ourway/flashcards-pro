A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour illustration depicting the two chambers of the UK Parliament, the House of Lords and the House of Commons, in a 16:9 landscape format. The composition is split vertically, with each chamber occupying roughly half of the frame. On the left, the House of Lords is represented by a scene featuring several stately figures in red robes, with coronets and ermine trim, engaged in a formal debate. The background features gothic arches and stained glass windows, hinting at the historical and traditional nature of the Lords. On the right, the House of Commons is depicted with a more bustling and diverse crowd of individuals, representing the general public, seated on green benches. These figures are dressed in a variety of contemporary clothing, reflecting the diverse demographics of the UK. The architecture in the background is similar to the Lords but feels more open and accessible, symbolizing the Commons' role as representatives of the people. A symbolic bridge, rendered in pastel blue, subtly connects the two chambers in the center of the image, signifying their collaborative role in the UK Parliament. The colour palette leans towards the pastel colours, with accents of UK flag colours (red, white, and blue) integrated into the details of the robes, architecture, and the connecting bridge to create a cohesive and memorable image. The overall art style is realistic, avoiding cartoonish elements, and aiming for a detailed and informative representation suitable for educational purposes.
