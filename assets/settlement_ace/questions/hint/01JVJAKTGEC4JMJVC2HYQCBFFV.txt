A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Oliver Cromwell in the mid-17th century. The composition is centered, adhering to a 16:9 landscape ratio. Cromwell is not wearing a crown, but instead, he is depicted in muted, earthy tones, reflecting the somber atmosphere of the post-Civil War era. He is dressed in dark, practical clothing, befitting his image as a military leader and 'Lord Protector,' not royal garments. He stands in front of the Houses of Parliament, which are rendered with architectural precision, showcasing the historical context. The buildings are partially shrouded in a light mist, creating a sense of solemnity and transition. Cromwell holds a simple, unadorned staff in his right hand, symbolizing his authority, but devoid of royal ornamentation. The color palette leans towards pastel blues and grays, with subtle hints of red in the parliamentary banners in the background, evoking the Union Jack's colors without directly replicating them. The overall mood is serious and reflective, emphasizing Cromwell's role as a leader who rejected the crown, opting instead for the title of Lord Protector. The details in his facial expression should convey determination and a sense of duty, rather than regal entitlement, reinforcing the correct answer.
