A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, ratio 16:9. The scene is set in 17th-century London, dominated by tightly packed timber-framed houses with steeply pitched roofs, rendered in muted pastel yellows and browns to evoke a sense of age and fragility. In the foreground, a cobblestone street is partially deserted, with a few figures depicted: a doctor in a long, dark coat and a beaked mask (a common plague-era garment) tending to a slumped figure wrapped in a simple cloth. A red "X" is prominently painted on a nearby door, signifying a plague-infected household. A wheelbarrow, laden with shrouded bodies, is being pushed by a lone figure, their face obscured by shadow, adding to the somber atmosphere. Rats, symbols of the plague's spread, scurry across the street. The sky is overcast and grey, reflecting the despair and gloom of the time. The composition focuses on the stark contrast between the everyday life of the city and the encroaching presence of death and disease. Subtle details, such as closed shutters on windows and discarded personal belongings in the street, further emphasize the impact of the plague on the city's inhabitants. The overall tone is melancholic and evocative, aiming to create a lasting visual impression of the devastation caused by the Great Plague.
