A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic Hollywood movie posters, with a distinct British flair. The artwork should be in a 16:9 landscape format, using a pastel colour palette with hints of red, white, and blue to subtly evoke the UK flag. The central focus is a split composition. On the left, a silhouette of Sir Alfred Hitchcock, portly and recognizable, is subtly framed by a suspenseful scene: a shadowy figure near a Bates Motel-esque building under a stormy night sky, elements suggestive of "Psycho." On the right, a stylized desert landscape, influenced by the visuals of "Alien" or "Blade Runner", with a lone, futuristic vehicle traversing the terrain, representing Ridley Scott's science fiction influence. The background blends into a soft, gradient sky with subtle pastel hues. The image should be rich in visual detail, avoiding cartoonish or abstract representations, and aiming for a realistic, illustrative quality, as if painted with watercolours. The aim is to create a memorable visual mnemonic connecting Hitchcock and Scott to British film directing. No text is included in the image.
