A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a classic British high street scene. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag. The central focus is on a quaint shop with a slightly crooked, charming facade, labeled simply with an emblem of a stylized product (e.g., a kettle, toaster, or a shoe). Emanating from the shop is a soft, diffused light, suggesting an interior. Standing outside the shop, facing towards the viewer, is a woman with a determined yet polite expression. She is holding a receipt in one hand and gesturing towards the shop with the other. A subtle, symbolic “scales of justice” is integrated into the shop's sign, but rendered artistically as part of the design, not explicitly as a legal symbol. The background includes other shops and pedestrians, softly blurred to maintain focus on the main subject, creating a sense of everyday life in a UK town. The overall composition should evoke a sense of fairness, consumer rights, and the resolution of disputes within a community setting. The sky above is a light, watercolor wash of blue, suggesting a calm and reasonable atmosphere. The image should create a visual association between a product complaint and a structured, legal-but-civil process.
