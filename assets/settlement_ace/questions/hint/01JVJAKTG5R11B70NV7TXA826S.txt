A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is Queen Elizabeth II, depicted in her later years, but with a youthful, benevolent aura. She is wearing a royal blue gown, reminiscent of the blue in the Union Jack, and the Imperial State Crown, rendered with meticulous detail to showcase its jewels. The crown is the primary focal point, sparkling subtly. Behind the Queen, a semi-circle composed of stylized flags of various Commonwealth countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, India, South Africa, etc.) fans out gently, suggesting the breadth of her symbolic leadership. The flags are simplified but recognizable, avoiding any textual elements. The background is a soft, pastel-toned sky, transitioning from a pale blue at the top to a gentle rose color near the horizon. Wisps of clouds, painted with delicate brushstrokes, add depth. The Queen's expression is serene and dignified, conveying a sense of stability and tradition. The overall composition should evoke a feeling of respect and historical continuity. The colour palette should lean heavily on blues, reds, and whites, drawing inspiration from the Union Jack, but softened into pastel shades to create a gentle and memorable visual. The image should focus on the Queen wearing the crown as the head of the commonwealth.
