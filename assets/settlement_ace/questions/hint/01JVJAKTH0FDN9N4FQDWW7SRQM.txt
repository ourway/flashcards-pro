A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting two distinct but connected scenes within a single 16:9 landscape composition. The color palette leans towards pastel hues interspersed with the red, white and blue of the UK flag. On the left side, centrally positioned, is a stylized depiction of a modern office building with large windows reflecting the sky. Inside one window, a person is working at a computer, subtly suggesting “wages from paid employment.” Small stylized pound sterling (£) symbols are gently raining down on the building, indicating the concept of earning income. The right side of the image features a quaint, semi-detached house with a "For Rent" sign subtly placed in the front yard, representing “income from property.” Behind the house, a flourishing apple tree is laden with ripe fruit, symbolizing savings and dividends. The apples are colored in shades of red and gold, and some are falling into a basket below, suggesting the idea of accumulating wealth. A winding path made of cobblestones, coloured in white and grey, connects the office building and the house, visually linking the two sources of income. The sky above is a soft, gradient blend of pastel blue and white, with fluffy clouds. The overall mood is calm and prosperous, suggesting financial well-being.
