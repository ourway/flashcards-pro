A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style, depicting the interior of the House of Commons. The color palette leans heavily on the blues and reds reminiscent of the UK flag, subtly muted to pastel shades for an educational feel. The composition is centered on the Speaker's Chair, ornately carved and bathed in soft light filtering through large, arched windows. Below, rows of MPs are seated, some actively engaged in debate, others listening intently. The overall atmosphere conveys a sense of serious deliberation and democratic process. The benches are densely packed, reflecting the large membership of the Commons. The Mace, a symbol of royal authority, rests prominently on the table in front of the Speaker. The architectural details are rendered with precision, showcasing the grandeur and history of the chamber. The image should evoke a feeling of importance and responsibility, visually emphasizing the House of Commons as the central hub of British political power and the voice of the electorate. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a sense of solemnity and respect. The image should avoid any specific individuals or political affiliations, focusing instead on the institutional importance of the House.
