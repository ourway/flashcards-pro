A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the Tudor Rose emblem set against a soft, parchment-toned background. The Tudor Rose, the prominent central subject, is a symbolic fusion of two distinct roses: the red rose of Lancaster and the white rose of York. The left side of the rose exhibits the deep crimson petals characteristic of the Lancaster rose, rendered with subtle gradations of red to convey depth and texture. The right side features the pristine white petals of the York rose, delicately shaded to highlight their velvety appearance. These two roses are seamlessly interwoven, their petals merging and intertwining to form a single, unified bloom. The central core of the rose showcases golden stamen, intricately detailed, adding a touch of regal splendor. The surrounding sepals are depicted in varying shades of green, providing a naturalistic contrast to the floral elements. The overall color palette leans towards pastel variations of red, white, and green, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag while maintaining a gentle, educational tone. The composition emphasizes the central placement of the Tudor Rose, ensuring it commands attention within the 16:9 frame. Soft, diffused lighting enhances the watercolor effect, creating a warm and inviting visual that aids in memorization.
