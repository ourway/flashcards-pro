A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a powerful steam train, painted in Great Western Railway's Brunswick green, majestically traversing a quintessential British countryside landscape. The train is the central focus, its wheels churning and steam billowing skyward in graceful, swirling patterns. The landscape unfolds behind the train, featuring rolling green hills dotted with sheep, a stone viaduct spanning a gentle river, and quaint villages nestled in the valleys. The composition emphasizes the westward trajectory of the train, with the horizon stretching towards the west, bathed in the warm, golden light of a setting sun. The sky is a pastel blue, fading into soft oranges and pinks near the horizon, mirroring the UK flag's color palette in a subtle way. The overall mood should be one of progress, grandeur, and the expansion of Britain's industrial prowess. The elements should be realistically rendered, with attention to the textures of the train's metal, the stone of the viaduct, and the wool of the sheep. The image should evoke a sense of awe and historical significance, capturing the spirit of the Great Western Railway as a groundbreaking achievement in British engineering.
