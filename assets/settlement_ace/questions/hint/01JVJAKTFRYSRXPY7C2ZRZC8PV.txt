A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Welsh flag (the Red Dragon flag, or Y Ddraig Goch) waving gently in a light breeze. The flag should dominate the center of the 16:9 landscape composition. The background should subtly fade from a pastel sky blue at the top to a pastel white near the bottom, mirroring the white and green fields of the flag. The red dragon, the central element, should be rendered with careful attention to detail: scales, claws, teeth, and a serpentine body that conveys both power and elegance. Its color should be a vibrant, saturated red, contrasting sharply with the white and green background. The green field beneath the dragon should be a lush, verdant hue, suggesting the rolling hills of Wales. The white field above should be a clean, bright white. The flag's fabric should appear slightly weathered, hinting at its historical significance. The overall mood should be one of national pride and mythical heritage, employing a pastel color palette with a focus on reds, greens, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag colors. The style should lean towards classical illustration, suitable for educational purposes, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements.
