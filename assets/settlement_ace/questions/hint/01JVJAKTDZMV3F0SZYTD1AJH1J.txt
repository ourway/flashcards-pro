A vibrant, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a fashion illustration, showcasing two distinct figures representing Vivienne Westwood and Mary Quant. The background features a stylized silhouette of the Houses of Parliament, subtly rendered in pastel blue and white, hinting at the British context.

On the left, a figure embodying Vivienne Westwood is depicted with fiery red, punk-inspired hair and dressed in a deconstructed tartan outfit, complete with safety pins and bold accessories. The clothing design should be reminiscent of her iconic punk fashion with clashing patterns. On the right, a figure symbolizing Mary Quant is shown with a neat, geometric bob haircut, clad in a brightly colored mini-skirt and go-go boots, embodying the youthful and revolutionary style of the 1960s. The mini-skirt should be a vibrant pastel pink.

The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades with pops of bold red and blue in Westwood's attire and Quant's mini-skirt, subtly referencing the Union Jack colors. The composition is balanced, with each figure occupying a significant portion of the frame, their contrasting styles visually emphasizing the breadth of British fashion influence. The ground beneath them is a stylized, cobblestone street, drawn in muted grey tones, adding depth and grounding the scene in a recognizable British setting. The overall mood is celebratory and fashion-forward, highlighting the designers' impact on British culture.
