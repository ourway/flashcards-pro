A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the Queen of the United Kingdom inaugurating the new parliamentary session. The central focus is Queen Elizabeth II, adorned in full royal regalia, including the Imperial State Crown and a long, flowing crimson robe trimmed with ermine. She is seated on the throne in the House of Lords, which is visible in the background. The throne is draped in opulent gold fabric. The House of Lords is intricately detailed with dark wood paneling, ornate carvings, and plush red benches occupied by Lords and Ladies in traditional attire. Sunlight streams in through arched windows, illuminating the scene and creating a sense of grandeur. The overall color palette leans towards regal reds, golds, and deep blues, reminiscent of the UK flag, with subtle pastel highlights to soften the scene. Symbolic elements include the Mace of the House of Lords prominently displayed, and the Royal Standard flag subtly visible in the background. The composition emphasizes the Queen's central role and authority, conveying the solemnity and historical significance of the occasion. The style should evoke a sense of tradition, history, and the enduring nature of the monarchy.
