A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration depicting the British House of Commons in a 16:9 landscape format. The scene focuses on two prominent groups of MPs seated facing each other. The group on the right, bathed in slightly brighter, warmer lighting, represents the ruling party. They appear numerous, but not overwhelmingly so. The group on the left, representing the Opposition, is visually positioned as the second-largest, noticeably smaller than the ruling party, but still substantial and formidable. The color palette leans towards pastel blues and reds, subtly referencing the UK flag. The Speaker's Chair is visible in the background, providing context. The artistic style is realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, maintaining a serious and educational tone. The composition should emphasize the balance of power between the two parties, with the Opposition clearly defined as the second strongest. The overall impression is one of structured debate and political balance within the UK's parliamentary system, reinforcing the idea that the Opposition consistently holds the position of the second-largest party.
