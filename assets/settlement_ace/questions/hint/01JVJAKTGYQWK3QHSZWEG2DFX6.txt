A hand-drawn, realistic, 2D image in watercolor style, depicting Queen Elizabeth I standing on the shores of the New World. The image ratio is 16:9 and landscape orientation. Queen Elizabeth I is the central figure, dressed in her iconic Tudor-era attire: a richly embroidered red gown, a high white ruff, and a jeweled crown atop her auburn hair. Her expression is regal and thoughtful as she gazes towards the horizon. The backdrop features a serene coastline with a few wooden sailing ships visible on the calm, turquoise ocean in the distance. On the shore in the foreground, a small group of English settlers are depicted constructing a simple wooden structure, symbolizing the first attempts at colonization. The landscape is lush and green, hinting at the abundant resources of the New World. To the left of the Queen, a flowering dogwood tree (a native plant of Virginia) is in full bloom, its white blossoms adding a touch of delicate beauty. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades, with reds, blues, and greens dominating to evoke a sense of historical significance and connection to the UK flag. The composition should be balanced, with the Queen as the focal point, subtly linked to the settlers and the landscape, visually narrating the beginning of English colonization during her reign.
