A detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, reminiscent of 19th-century industrial landscapes, set in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a highly detailed steam engine, rendered with intricate mechanical components, gleaming brass, and polished steel. The engine is depicted powering a large factory with multiple chimneys expelling gentle, white steam into a pastel sky of light blues and pinks. The factory is built of red brick and has large arched windows. Around the factory, show a sprawling landscape with rolling green hills, suggesting the transition from agricultural to industrial society. In the foreground, place a symbolic element: a gear made of interwoven roses (red and white), representing the fusion of nature and technology. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with accents of red, white, and blue subtly incorporated in the details of the factory and landscape, subtly nodding to the UK flag. The composition should evoke a sense of progress and innovation while retaining a soft, nostalgic feel. The style should be realistic enough to convey the power of steam but with a gentle, artistic touch suitable for educational purposes. Avoid any harsh or overly industrial tones; aim for a scene that is both informative and aesthetically pleasing.
