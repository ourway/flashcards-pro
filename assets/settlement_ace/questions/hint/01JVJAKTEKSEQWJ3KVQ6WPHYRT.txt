A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a beam of radiant, golden light emanating from the heavens, illuminating a regal figure kneeling in prayer. The figure, representing King James I or Charles I, is adorned in royal robes of deep blue and crimson, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack. A faint halo, rendered in soft, ethereal blues and whites, hovers above the king's head, symbolizing divine favor. The background features a grand, ornate cathedral interior, with stained-glass windows casting vibrant, multicolored patterns across the stone floor. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues, creating a sense of reverence and tranquility. Above the king, a symbolic representation of God is suggested through the radiant light and subtle cloud formations, avoiding any direct depiction. The composition focuses on the central beam of light connecting the heavens and the king, emphasizing the concept of divine appointment. The image should evoke a sense of historical importance and the power of faith, visually linking the king's authority to a higher power.
