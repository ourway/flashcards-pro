A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic sports illustrations, depicting Bobby Moore, the captain of the English football team, triumphantly holding the Jules Rimet Trophy aloft. The scene is set within the iconic Wembley Stadium, suggested by the subtle arches in the background, rendered in soft, pastel shades of blue and white, evoking the colours of the British flag. Moore is depicted in his classic white England jersey with the three lions crest prominently displayed, his face radiating joy and pride. The focus is on the trophy, gleaming gold under the stadium lights, intricately detailed to showcase its unique design. Around Moore, the blurred figures of his teammates are visible, celebrating the victory. The composition is centered, drawing the eye directly to Moore and the trophy. The style is painterly, with visible brushstrokes and a soft, slightly desaturated colour palette to give it a vintage feel, emulating the look of a classic photograph from 1966. The overall effect should be one of national pride and sporting achievement, creating a memorable visual association between Bobby Moore and England's World Cup victory.
