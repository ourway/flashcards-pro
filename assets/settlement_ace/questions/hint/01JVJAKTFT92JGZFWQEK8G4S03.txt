A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in watercolor style (16:9 aspect ratio), depicting Lancelot 'Capability' Brown and Gertrude Jekyll collaboratively designing a garden. Brown, dressed in 18th-century attire with a tricorn hat, gestures expansively towards a rolling, verdant landscape featuring a serpentine lake and strategically placed mature trees. Jekyll, in early 20th-century dress with gardening gloves and tools, kneels in the foreground, carefully planting colorful, textured flowerbeds. The garden is a harmonious blend of Brown's naturalistic landscaping and Jekyll's vibrant, artistic planting schemes. Dominant colors are pastel greens, blues, and floral pinks, accented with earthy browns and creams. The composition emphasizes the balance between structure and nature, reflecting their shared profession. The background showcases a stately home in the distance, partially obscured by trees, symbolizing the grand scale of their garden designs. The sky should be soft and overcast, typical of the English countryside, creating a diffused light that highlights the textures of the foliage and flowers. The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish elements, and evoking a sense of historical accuracy and aesthetic beauty. The overall image should convey a sense of tranquility, creativity, and the enduring impact of their work on British garden design.
