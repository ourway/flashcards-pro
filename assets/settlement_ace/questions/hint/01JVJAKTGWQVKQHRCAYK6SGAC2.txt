A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, showcasing the Houses of Parliament in London. The composition is centered on the Palace of Westminster, bathed in the soft, early morning light. The color palette leans heavily on pastel blues and reds, reminiscent of the Union Jack. In the foreground, a flock of stately swans gracefully glides on the River Thames. Among the swans, one swan is noticeably larger and older, seemingly wearing a small, ornate crown. This "hereditary" swan is depicted mid-shed, feathers gently falling from its body, symbolizing the loss of automatic privilege. The falling feathers swirl slightly, creating a sense of movement and transition. In the background, the iconic Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) stands tall, its clock face subtly reflecting the numbers "19" and "99" through clever light and shadow play, almost imperceptible but noticeable upon closer inspection. The overall atmosphere is one of gentle change and historical significance, highlighting the transition within the House of Lords. The artwork should avoid any cartoonish features and maintain a sophisticated, educational aesthetic.
