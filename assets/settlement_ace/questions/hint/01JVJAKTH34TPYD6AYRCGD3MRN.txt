A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style depicting twenty-eight stylized, interconnected houses, each representing a member country of the EU. The houses are arranged in a circular pattern, symbolizing unity and collaboration. Each house should be subtly unique in its architectural style, drawing inspiration from the diverse architectural traditions across Europe, but maintaining a harmonious overall aesthetic. The color palette should be predominantly pastel, with soft blues, pinks, yellows, and greens, evoking a sense of peace and cooperation. Subtle elements of the UK flag colours (red, white, and blue) should be integrated into the details of a few of the houses – perhaps a red roof tile, a blue window frame, or a white door. The houses are nestled in a lush, rolling landscape of green hills, dotted with symbolic flora and fauna representative of different European regions – lavender fields suggesting France, windmills alluding to the Netherlands, and olive groves hinting at Italy. A winding, cobblestone path connects all the houses, illustrating the interconnectedness of the EU member states. The sky should be a soft, watercolor wash of blues and whites, with gentle sunlight illuminating the scene, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The overall composition should be balanced and harmonious, emphasizing the strength and unity of the EU through its visual representation of interconnected homes within a shared landscape.
