A heartwarming, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting a cheerful family scene set against a soft, pastel blue sky. A father is playfully tossing a young child into the air, both beaming with joy. The father is dressed in smart-casual attire, perhaps a light blue shirt and khakis, while the child wears brightly colored overalls. To the left of the father and child, the mother stands smiling, holding a bouquet of sunflowers. In the immediate foreground, three stepping stones are visible, each slightly elevated above the ground. The first stone is adorned with a single, large daisy, the second with two intertwined roses, and the third with three vibrant sunflowers. The background features a quintessential English garden, complete with a neatly trimmed hedge, a blooming rose bush, and a glimpse of a quaint cottage with a thatched roof in the distance. The overall color palette should lean towards soft pastels, with pops of yellow from the sunflowers and roses. This idyllic scene captures the essence of family togetherness and the joy of Father's Day, visually emphasizing the number 'three' as a gentle reminder of the third Sunday in June. The style should be realistic but with a touch of whimsy, creating a visually appealing and memorable image. The 16:9 ratio should focus on the family in the center with the 3 stepping stones in the foreground.
