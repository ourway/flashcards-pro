A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Catherine of Aragon's arrival in England. The scene is framed in a 16:9 ratio, with the main focus centered. Catherine, dressed in ornate, historically accurate Spanish royal attire of the early 16th century, stands on the deck of a ship adorned with both the Spanish flag (Rojigualda) and subtle Tudor roses. The ship is sailing towards the white cliffs of Dover, rendered in soft, chalky pastel tones. The sky above Spain is a bright, sunny azure blue, transitioning to a more muted, overcast grey above England, subtly representing the change in climate and culture. In the foreground, the calm, turquoise sea reflects the colors of the sky. A few seagulls fly around the ship. Symbolic elements include a small chest filled with oranges (representing Spain's sunny climate and produce) near Catherine's feet and a single, prominent red rose clutched in her hand, foreshadowing her role in English history. The overall color palette leans towards the reds and yellows of the Spanish flag and the blues and whites of the English coastline, creating a visually harmonious and memorable image. The style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and regal elegance, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements.
