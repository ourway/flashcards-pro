A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style. The scene depicts two distinct boroughs, contrasting their characteristics. On the left, a "rotten borough" is symbolized by a dilapidated, miniature town nestled within a decaying apple core. The apple core is riddled with holes and surrounded by wilting leaves, emphasizing the 'rotten' aspect. Only a handful of tiny, silhouetted figures are scattered within the town, signifying the small number of voters. The color palette here leans towards muted greens, browns, and yellows, evoking a sense of decay. On the right, a "pocket borough" is represented by a grand, stately manor house perched atop a hill. The manor is surrounded by lush, well-maintained gardens in pastel colours. A large, opulent pocket watch, made of gold, is subtly incorporated into the landscape, with the manor house reflecting on its shiny surface, symbolizing control by a wealthy family. A winding road leads up to the manor, suggesting access and influence. The overall composition contrasts the neglected, diminutive rotten borough with the prosperous, controlled pocket borough. The sky is a soft, pastel blue, unifying the two scenes and creating a harmonious, educational image. The ratio is 16:9, with the two boroughs positioned on either side of the center.
