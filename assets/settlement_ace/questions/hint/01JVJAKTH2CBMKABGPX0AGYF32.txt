A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a somber scene of 17th-century London during the Great Plague of 1665. The composition is centered on a cobblestone street winding through densely packed Tudor-style buildings, their timber frames dark against whitewashed walls. A lone figure, a plague doctor clad in a long, dark robe, a wide-brimmed hat, and a distinctive bird-like mask, stands in the foreground, holding a posy of flowers. The flowers are in pastel colors of pink, yellow and white. Around him, faint, ghostly figures of people are depicted, some holding their faces, others lying prone on the street. Subtle visual cues suggest illness: handkerchiefs held to faces, faint clouds of sickness emanating from affected individuals. The color palette leans towards muted blues, grays, and browns, punctuated by the stark white of the buildings and the dark tones of the doctor's attire, creating a melancholic atmosphere. The sky is overcast, mirroring the despair of the era. The overall effect should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and the devastating impact of the plague on London's population, serving as a visual mnemonic for the correct answer. The image avoids any text or numbers, relying solely on visual storytelling to convey the information. The ratio is 16:9, landscape orientation.
