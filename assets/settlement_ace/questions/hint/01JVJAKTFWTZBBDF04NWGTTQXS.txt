A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting two distinct, yet connected cityscapes. The image, in 16:9 landscape format, should be dominated by a warm, pastel color palette, subtly incorporating hues of red, white, and blue reminiscent of the UK flag. The left cityscape represents India, characterized by intricately detailed Mughal-style architecture, bustling marketplaces filled with traditionally dressed figures, and serene temples nestled amidst lush greenery. The right cityscape symbolizes China, showcasing iconic pagodas with upturned eaves, winding alleyways teeming with people in traditional clothing, and tranquil gardens featuring koi ponds and bamboo groves. A stylized, winding river, rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor technique, connects the two cityscapes, subtly suggesting the journey and integration of these workers. The river should be teeming with boats each carrying people. Each cityscape should visually suggest a population of one million people through the sheer density and detail of its inhabitants and structures, without explicitly showing numerical figures. The overall composition should evoke a sense of industriousness and cultural richness, highlighting the significant contribution of these workers to the UK's history following the Emancipation Act. The artistic style should lean towards realism, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, to maintain an educational and respectful tone.
