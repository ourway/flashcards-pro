A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical illuminated manuscripts. The scene is set in a grand, medieval scriptorium with light streaming in from arched windows. Dominating the center is a large, ornate book, open and resting on a heavy wooden lectern. The book's pages are filled with meticulously drawn miniature landscapes depicting various aspects of 11th-century England: fields being plowed, forests teeming with wildlife, villages with thatched roofs, and Norman castles on hilltops. Each miniature scene is rendered with incredible detail, showcasing the resources and activities of the land. Standing beside the lectern is William the Conqueror, depicted not as a fearsome warrior but as a thoughtful ruler, observing the book's contents with a discerning gaze. He is dressed in regal attire, subtly incorporating the colors of the UK flag (red, white, and blue) into his robes. Around him, scribes are diligently working at their desks, using quills and ink to record information. The color palette should be primarily muted pastel tones, with occasional vibrant accents to highlight the richness of the English landscape. The overall composition should evoke a sense of historical importance and the meticulous nature of the survey, emphasizing the idea of a comprehensive record of William's 'domain', subtly hinting at "The Domesday Book". The image should have a 16:9 aspect ratio.
