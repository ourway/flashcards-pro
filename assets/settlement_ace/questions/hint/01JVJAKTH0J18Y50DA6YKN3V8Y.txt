A hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a quaint British village scene. The central focus is a bustling village square, with a classic red brick building prominently displayed, representing the local council headquarters. The building has large windows allowing a glimpse of people working inside, implying activity and authority. A traditional British phone booth and a red post box stand nearby, further rooting the scene in UK culture. The village square is surrounded by charming, pastel-colored shops with flower boxes overflowing with blooms. People of diverse ages and backgrounds are depicted walking and interacting, creating a sense of community. A gentle, rolling green hill rises in the background, dotted with sheep. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and greens, reminiscent of the UK flag but softened for a calming effect. The art style is realistic yet gentle, emphasizing the everyday aspects of local life and the central role of the council building within the community, visually reinforcing the concept of local councils as 'local authorities'. The image should evoke a sense of familiarity and the importance of local governance.
