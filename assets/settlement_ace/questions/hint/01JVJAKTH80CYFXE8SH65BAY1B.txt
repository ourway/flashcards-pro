A serene, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape orientation, primarily using a pastel color palette with accents of red. The central focus is a vast field of vibrant red poppies, gently swaying in a soft breeze under a clear, pale blue sky. The field stretches towards a distant, rolling green hillside, reminiscent of the British countryside. Interspersed subtly among the poppies are delicate silhouettes of peaceful doves in flight, barely visible against the sky, symbolizing peace. The poppies themselves are realistically rendered, with detailed petals and dark centers. At the bottom center of the image, slightly out of focus to maintain the prominence of the poppies, is a worn, wooden cross, partially obscured by the flowers, hinting at remembrance. The overall composition evokes a sense of tranquility, remembrance, and hope, with the red poppies being the dominant visual element, firmly associating them with the concept of Remembrance Day. The art style should be realistic and detailed, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements.
