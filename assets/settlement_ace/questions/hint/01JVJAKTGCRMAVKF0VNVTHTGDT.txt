A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style landscape depicting a long, winding road stretching from the rugged north coast of Scotland to the rolling hills of southern England. The Scottish Highlands are represented by majestic, mist-covered mountains with patches of heather in bloom. A small, stylized lighthouse stands on the northern coastline, its light beam subtly emanating outwards. As the road progresses south, it transitions into the gentler, greener landscape of the English countryside. Fields of wheat, dotted with sheep, flank the road. In the far distance, the white cliffs of Dover mark the southern coast of England. The road itself should be slightly elevated, giving a sense of the great distance covered. Along the road, subtly incorporate mile markers that count upwards, but without showing numbers. The color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue (for the Scottish sky and sea), green (for the English countryside), and heather purple (for the Scottish Highlands), and white (for the Dover Cliffs). The overall composition emphasizes the length of the journey and the diverse landscapes of the UK. The sky transitions gradually from a brighter, more vibrant blue in Scotland to a softer, more muted blue in England, reflecting the change in latitude. The style should be realistic, yet with a touch of whimsy to make it memorable. Focus on intricate details in the landscape: the texture of the heather, the wool on the sheep, the waves crashing against the Scottish coast, without any text.
