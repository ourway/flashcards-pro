A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Grand National horse race. The scene is set on a bright, sunny day at Aintree Racecourse. Focus should be on the horses and jockeys leaping over a challenging fence, rendered with meticulous detail to show the power and athleticism of the horses. The jockeys are dressed in brightly colored silks, each unique and eye-catching. The background features a jubilant crowd of spectators, dressed in traditional British attire, waving flags and cheering enthusiastically. The composition emphasizes the motion and excitement of the race, with splashes of mud and grass adding to the realism. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with accents of red, white, and blue subtly incorporated to evoke the colors of the UK flag. The sky is a soft, gradient blue with fluffy white clouds. The fence in the foreground is particularly detailed, showing the wooden structure and the greenery it's made of. The image should convey a sense of British tradition, sporting excellence, and the thrill of horse racing.
