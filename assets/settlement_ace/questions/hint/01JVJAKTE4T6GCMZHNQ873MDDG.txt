A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image in a realistic style, depicting a grand, ancient cathedral reminiscent of Canterbury Cathedral, rendered in soft pastel blues, whites, and creams, dominating the central composition of the 16:9 landscape. The cathedral's iconic central tower rises majestically, bathed in a gentle, ethereal light. From the top of the tower, ethereal, stylized wings, reminiscent of an angel's wings, extend outwards, reaching towards stylized representations of different continents arranged around the cathedral. Each continent is depicted with subtle, symbolic elements representing its unique characteristics, for example, Africa with a stylized baobab tree, Asia with a pagoda, and the Americas with a stylized mountain range. The wings are rendered in a gradient of pastel blues fading into white at the tips, symbolizing the reach and influence spreading from the central church. Small, stylized doves fly alongside the wings, further emphasizing the message of peace and outreach. The scene is set against a soft, blended sky of pastel blues and pinks, creating a serene and spiritual atmosphere. The overall impression should be one of gentle expansion and global connection originating from the central, historically significant church.
