A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a group of determined-looking women marching in an Edwardian-era London street, the Houses of Parliament subtly visible in the background. The women are dressed in clothing typical of the early 20th century, primarily in suffragette colours: purple, white, and green. They carry banners, but the banners are intentionally blank, devoid of text, only showing the symbolic colours to represent their cause. The lead woman holds a stylized, artistically rendered ballot box, overflowing with white paper ballots, emphasizing the concept of voting. Pastel shades of purple, green, and white dominate the color palette, with gentle sunlight casting soft shadows on the scene. The cobblestone street reflects the light, adding depth to the image. The overall composition should convey a sense of peaceful yet resolute determination and historical significance, reminiscent of vintage posters or book illustrations. The sky is a soft, watercolour blue, with subtle cloud formations. The style should be detailed and realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and evoke the feeling of a historical painting.
