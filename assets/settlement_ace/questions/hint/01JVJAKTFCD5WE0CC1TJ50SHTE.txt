A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a large mosaic artwork that resembles the floor of the UK Parliament. The mosaic is composed of many small, irregularly shaped tiles, each representing a different constituency within the UK. Each tile is colored in a unique pastel shade, predominantly blues, reds, and whites reminiscent of the UK flag, but also incorporating greens, yellows, and purples to represent the diversity of the constituencies. Each tile's colour subtly blends into the next, creating a harmonious, unified image. At the center of each tile, a symbolic figure of a person stands, each figure coloured in the same hue as the tile they inhabit, representing the Member of Parliament for that constituency. The figures are diverse in appearance, reflecting the varied population of the UK. The composition of the mosaic should be such that the overall shape roughly resembles the outline of the United Kingdom, further emphasizing the interconnectedness of the constituencies. The lighting is soft and diffused, highlighting the texture of the watercolor paper and the subtle variations in color within the mosaic. The image should convey a sense of unity and representation, with each constituency clearly and distinctly represented within the larger whole of the UK.
