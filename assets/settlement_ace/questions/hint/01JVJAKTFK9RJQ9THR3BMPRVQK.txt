A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format. The color palette primarily consists of pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The central focus is a split scene, bisected vertically. On the left side, depict an Edwardian-era London scene, circa 1908. Prominently feature a stylized depiction of the Olympic rings subtly incorporated into the architecture of a grand, classical stadium. Spectators in period attire (boater hats, long dresses) are cheering. The overall atmosphere is one of nascent sporting excitement and early 20th-century optimism. On the right side of the image, illustrate a post-World War II London scene, circa 1948. Show a similar stadium, rebuilt with a more utilitarian, post-war architectural style, also bearing subtly integrated Olympic rings. People are wearing simpler clothing and a sense of resilience and rebuilding is in the air. Symbolically, a dove of peace flies gently between the two stadiums, connecting the two eras. The sky in both scenes should be clear and bright, enhancing the overall sense of hope and national pride. The style should be realistic but with a gentle, nostalgic watercolor aesthetic.
