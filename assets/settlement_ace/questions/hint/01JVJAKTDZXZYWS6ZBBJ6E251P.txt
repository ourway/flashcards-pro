A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor painting in a landscape format (16:9) depicting the rugged terrains of Scotland and Wales, symbolizing their successful resistance to Anglo-Saxon rule. The central focus is on two distinct landscapes: on the left, the Scottish Highlands, characterized by towering, mist-shrouded mountains, deep lochs reflecting the sky, and scattered heather in bloom with pastel purples and greens. A lone, ancient stone tower stands atop one of the peaks, a beacon of enduring Scottish identity. On the right, the Welsh countryside unfolds with rolling green hills, dramatic coastal cliffs meeting the sea, and valleys dotted with quaint stone villages. A winding path leads up to a medieval Welsh castle perched on a hilltop, its flag bearing a stylized red dragon fluttering in the breeze. A subtle, almost ethereal, line of defense, represented by a faint, glowing blue border (reminiscent of the blue in the Union Jack), separates these regions from a flatter, more open English landscape receding into the background. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with blues, greens, purples, and browns dominating the scene, evoking a sense of peace, resilience, and cultural preservation. The sky above is a soft, watercolor wash of pale blue and white, suggesting a bright, clear day. The style should be reminiscent of classic landscape paintings, emphasizing detail and realism.
