A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the United Kingdom as a large, central island rendered in shades of blue, reminiscent of the Union Jack. Upon this island, four distinct figures stand, representing England (a figure dressed in Tudor attire), Scotland (a figure in traditional Highland dress), Wales (a figure with a dragon emblem), and Northern Ireland (a figure holding a shamrock). These figures are positioned closely together, symbolizing their unity within the UK. To the west and south-east of the main island, smaller, separate islands are depicted in soft pastel yellows and greens. One island is shaped slightly like a "M" (Isle of Man), and the other is a cluster of smaller islands (Channel Islands). On each of these smaller islands, figures stand waving towards the UK, but are distinctly separate and not part of the central group. The sea surrounding all the islands is a tranquil, light blue, with subtle wave patterns to indicate the geographical separation. The overall composition should convey a sense of familial connection but also distinct independence. The style should evoke classic British illustrations, with attention to detail in the clothing and geographical features.
