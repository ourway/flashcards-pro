A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a bustling harbor scene in the 1950s United Kingdom. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly reflecting the colors of the UK flag. In the center of the image, a large passenger ship, adorned with a stylized Union Jack flag, is docking. Disembarking from the ship are diverse groups of people, dressed in clothing representative of various cultures and nationalities, carrying suitcases and hopeful expressions. They are walking towards a city skyline in the background, which features iconic British landmarks such as Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament, rendered in soft, muted tones. The sky above is a gentle pastel blue with fluffy white clouds. On the docks, British workers are shown welcoming the newcomers, offering assistance and friendly gestures. Symbolic elements such as blooming flowers and growing trees should be subtly incorporated around the harbor, representing growth and prosperity. The overall composition should convey a sense of optimism, integration, and the positive impact of immigration on the UK's economy during that era. The horizon line should be slightly lower than the center of the image, emphasizing the vastness of the opportunity and the hopeful journey of the immigrants.
