A hand-drawn, realistic, watercolour-style 2D image in pastel colours (or UK flag colours) depicting a quintessential Halloween scene in a quaint British village setting (16:9 ratio). The focal point is a row of terraced houses with softly glowing windows, each adorned with whimsically carved pumpkins grinning from the doorsteps. The pumpkins should vary in size and expression, some with triangular eyes and toothy grins, others with more rounded, jovial faces. Children dressed in classic Halloween costumes – ghosts draped in white sheets, a little witch in a pointed hat, a tiny goblin with pointy ears – are trick-or-treating, their bags slightly bulging with sweets. A cobblestone street winds gently through the village, lit by the warm, diffused light of old-fashioned street lamps. The sky is a deep twilight blue, with a crescent moon peeking through wispy clouds. Scatter fallen autumn leaves (red, orange, and yellow) across the cobblestones, adding a touch of seasonal charm. In the background, a silhouette of a church steeple can be seen against the twilight sky, subtly hinting at the historical origins of Halloween. The overall atmosphere should be one of friendly spookiness and festive community spirit, conveying the traditional observation of Halloween on October 31st. Avoid any overly scary or violent imagery; instead, focus on the lighthearted and joyful aspects of the holiday.
