A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting the iconic Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland under a pastel dawn sky. The Causeway's hexagonal basalt columns are arranged in a visually striking manner, with several columns distinctly highlighted in a pale blue. Positioned atop the Causeway, arranged symmetrically around the centre of the image, are stylized, pastel-colored sheep, each with a uniquely patterned wool coat. There are nine rows of twelve sheep each. The entire scene is bathed in soft, diffused light, creating a serene and memorable atmosphere. The composition emphasizes the natural beauty of the landscape and the ordered arrangement of the sheep, symbolizing the elected members. The pastel color palette should consist of soft blues, pinks, and greens, reminiscent of the UK flag's colors and the tranquil Northern Irish countryside. The art style should be realistic yet gentle, avoiding harsh lines or overly detailed textures, to maintain a focus on the overall visual mnemonic. The landscape occupies the lower two-thirds of the frame, while the sky fills the upper third, providing a sense of depth and scale.
