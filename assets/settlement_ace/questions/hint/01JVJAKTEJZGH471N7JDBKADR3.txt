A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, adhering to a 16:9 landscape ratio. The color palette should be dominated by pastel blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag, creating a calming yet patriotic atmosphere. The central focus is a set of balanced scales, rendered in polished brass, symbolizing justice and impartiality. On one scale pan rests a miniature, detailed model of the Houses of Parliament, representing the political landscape. The other scale pan holds a quill pen, poised above a blank scroll, signifying the civil servant's impartial service and unbiased record-keeping. The background features a soft, blurred depiction of the British countryside, rolling hills and fields, subtly hinting at the wider public good that civil servants serve. The scales are positioned on a sturdy, antique wooden table, suggesting tradition and steadfastness. Sunlight streams in from an unseen window, casting gentle shadows that enhance the depth and realism of the scene. The overall composition aims for a sense of quiet dignity and unwavering fairness, visually reinforcing the concept of impartiality as a core value.
