A hand-drawn, realistic, watercolour-style image, ratio 16:9, depicting a single, empty, dark wooden chair positioned centrally on a stage bathed in soft, diffused light. The stage backdrop is a muted pastel blue, reminiscent of a clear twilight sky. The chair itself is slightly worn, suggesting history and use, and has a small, almost unnoticeable British flag draped casually over one armrest. A single spotlight shines directly onto the empty chair, creating a sense of focus and highlighting its emptiness. Around the central stage, in the blurred background, are silhouetted figures representing a diverse crowd, subtly suggesting a waiting audience. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel blues, greys and browns, with the flag adding a touch of red, white, and blue. The composition should emphasize the solitude and significance of the vacant chair, implying a temporary absence rather than a complete void. The style should evoke a sense of historical importance and democratic process, without being overly dramatic or sombre. The stage floor is a polished wood, reflecting the soft light, adding depth to the scene. The image should convey the idea of a temporary vacancy requiring a specific event (byelection) to fill it, rather than triggering a general election.
