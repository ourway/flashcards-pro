A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a serene Scottish landscape under a pastel-colored sky of soft blues, pinks, and whites. The central focus is a solitary figure of Robert Burns, rendered with careful attention to historical accuracy in his clothing, standing on a heather-covered hillside. He is gazing towards a picturesque scene of rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep. In the mid-ground, a traditional stone cottage with a thatched roof nestles peacefully, smoke gently curling from its chimney. A meandering, crystal-clear stream cuts through the landscape, reflecting the pastel sky. Dominating the background are majestic, mist-shrouded mountains, their peaks hinting at the rugged beauty of the Scottish Highlands. Subtle details, such as thistles growing near Burns' feet and the faint sound waves emanating from a set of bagpipes leaning against a nearby rock, allude to Scottish culture and heritage. The overall composition should evoke a sense of tranquility and the timeless beauty of the Scottish countryside, visually associating Burns with his homeland. The entire image should be contained within a 16:9 aspect ratio, with the most important elements concentrated in the center.
