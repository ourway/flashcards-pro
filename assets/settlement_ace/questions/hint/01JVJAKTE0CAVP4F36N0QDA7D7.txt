A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical portraiture. The scene is divided into two distinct central panels against a soft, subtly textured background of faded parchment colour. The left panel depicts Anne Boleyn, portrayed with a sorrowful yet dignified expression. She wears a dark green Tudor gown with intricate gold embroidery and a pearl necklace. Her dark hair is styled according to the period, with a distinctive gable hood. A single teardrop rolls down her cheek. Behind her, barely visible through a misty veil, is the faint outline of the Tower of London. To the right panel, Catherine Howard is depicted similarly, but her gown is a vibrant rose red, reflecting her youth and perceived impulsiveness. Her hair is a lighter auburn, and her expression conveys a mix of fear and regret. A faint, ghostly image of Hampton Court Palace appears behind her. Connecting both panels is a stylized, ornate axe, its blade clean and gleaming, positioned horizontally. The handle of the axe is wrapped in a crimson ribbon, symbolizing the tragic fate of both queens. The overall colour palette leans towards muted pastels and earthy tones, with strategic pops of red and green to draw the eye. The composition emphasizes the central figures and the axe, visually linking them and serving as a stark reminder of their shared destiny.
