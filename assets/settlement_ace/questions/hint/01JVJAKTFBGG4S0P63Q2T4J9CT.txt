A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic botanical illustrations with a touch of historical painting. The image, in a 16:9 landscape format, centers on a large, mature English oak tree, its branches spreading wide and its leaves rendered with intricate detail in varying shades of green, accented by hints of brown and gold to suggest the season of early autumn. Partially obscured within the dense foliage, but subtly highlighted by dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves, is a figure representing King Charles II. He is dressed in simple, earth-toned clothing, blending with the colors of the tree trunk and branches. His face is partially visible, conveying a sense of anxious watchfulness. The colours are mainly pastel: light greens, browns, and pale blues. Around the base of the tree, the undergrowth is suggested with delicate strokes, and in the far background, hints of the English countryside – rolling hills and a distant village – are visible, rendered in soft, muted tones. The overall composition should evoke a sense of secrecy and refuge, emphasizing the oak tree as a sanctuary. The art style aims for realism, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements. The color palette incorporates pastel colours and hues reminiscent of the UK flag, with subtle reds and blues appearing in the distant landscape and the king's clothing, respectively. The illustration style should be similar to classical watercolour botanical art, with a focus on detail and realism.
