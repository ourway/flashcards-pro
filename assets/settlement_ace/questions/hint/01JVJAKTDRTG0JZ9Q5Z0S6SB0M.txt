A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image, ratio 16:9, depicting the Houses of Parliament. The Palace of Westminster is centrally positioned, bathed in soft, pastel-toned sunlight reminiscent of a crisp autumn morning in London. The River Thames flows gently in the foreground, reflecting the building's majestic silhouette. The House of Commons chamber is illustrated with a vibrant, energetic atmosphere, filled with diverse, realistically rendered figures engaged in lively debate. Their clothing should be in muted pastel tones. Sunlight streams through the windows, highlighting the speaker's chair. Conversely, the House of Lords chamber is depicted in softer, muted blues and greys, conveying a sense of quiet contemplation and historical gravitas. Fewer figures are present, and the overall atmosphere is more subdued. A symbolic, slightly oversized mace rests prominently in front of the Commons speaker's chair, signifying authority. Subtle visual cues, such as brighter lighting and more dynamic composition, emphasize the Commons' vitality compared to the Lords. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The art style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish elements, and should aim for an aesthetically pleasing and educational depiction of the Houses of Parliament. The image should not contain any text.
