A watercolour painting in a realistic style, depicting two intertwined hands, one male and one female, against a backdrop subtly blending the colours of the UK flag (red, white, and blue) in a soft, pastel palette. The female hand is shown with a delicate bracelet on the wrist, and appears to be slightly resisting, with fingers gently curved inward. The male hand is clasped firmly around the female hand, conveying a sense of unwanted pressure. The background features a blurred, soft-focus image of the scales of justice, subtly tilted, symbolising the imbalance of power. A single, wilting rose lies near the hands, representing the potential damage caused by coercion. The lighting is soft and diffused, emanating from the top left, casting gentle shadows that emphasise the tension in the hand clasp. The overall composition is centered and balanced, with a focus on the hands as the primary subject. The artwork evokes a sense of sadness and injustice, highlighting the importance of consent and the violation that occurs when it is absent. The image should be 16:9 and landscape orientation, with the main subject and idea mainly in the center of the image.
