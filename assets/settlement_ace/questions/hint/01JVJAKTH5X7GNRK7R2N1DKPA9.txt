A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a Scottish courtroom scene. The focus is on the jury box, where fifteen diverse individuals are seated. Each juror is rendered with distinct facial features and expressions, suggesting thoughtful deliberation. The backdrop features elements of traditional Scottish architecture, such as stone walls and arched windows, subtly incorporating the nation's heritage. The color palette leans towards pastel hues, with gentle blues, soft reds, and muted whites reminiscent of the UK flag, fostering a calm and serious atmosphere. The composition emphasizes the unity of the jury, arranged in a way that guides the viewer's eye across each member. Subtle tartan patterns are woven into the jurors' attire, adding a touch of Scottish identity without being overwhelming. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a sense of solemnity and importance. The overall artistic goal is to create a memorable visual mnemonic, associating the image of a full, diverse jury in a Scottish courtroom with the number fifteen, aiding recall of the correct answer. The image should evoke a sense of justice, fairness, and the critical role of the jury in the Scottish legal system.
