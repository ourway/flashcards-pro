A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a stylized, oversized calendar page representing February, subtly indicated by delicate winter-themed floral illustrations (snowdrops and crocuses) bordering the page. Overlaid on the number '14' is a large, intricately designed heart, composed of intertwined red and white roses. The heart casts a soft shadow, giving it a slight depth. Two doves, symbols of love and peace, are perched on either side of the heart, facing inwards as if whispering sweet nothings to each other. A pastel pink background with subtle watercolor washes suggests romance and gentleness. The overall tone is romantic and celebratory, reminiscent of vintage Valentine's cards. The art style should be realistic but with a touch of whimsy, suitable for educational purposes. The colors are primarily pastel pinks, reds, and whites, with hints of green from the floral elements, subtly echoing the colours of the UK flag without being overtly patriotic. The composition is balanced, with the heart and the date 14 being the primary focal points, ensuring the viewer's eye is immediately drawn to the key information.
