A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a classic British living room scene. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades with subtle red, white, and blue accents reminiscent of the UK flag. The focal point is a vintage-style television set, its screen glowing softly, and displaying a generic image of rolling green hills and grazing sheep, symbolizing British landscapes and culture. On a small, ornate table beside the television rests a steaming cup of tea in a delicate china teacup with a Union Jack pattern. The room is softly lit by a table lamp with a fringed shade, casting warm shadows. A comfortable armchair sits invitingly nearby. Behind the armchair, partially visible, is a bookshelf filled with classic literature, hinting at the BBC's commitment to educational and cultural programming. The overall composition should evoke a sense of nostalgia, British heritage, and the central role of television in British home life, thereby visually linking the TV licence fee to the BBC. The absence of any text is crucial, ensuring the image relies solely on visual cues to prompt recall. The image should be of 16:9 ratio.
