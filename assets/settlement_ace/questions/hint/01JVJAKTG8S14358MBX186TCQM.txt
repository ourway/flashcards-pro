A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolour painting in a realistic style, depicting King Charles I standing in a grand, yet subtly crumbling throne room. The color palette leans heavily on pastel shades of blue, red, and white, evoking the Union Jack subtly without directly replicating it. Charles I is dressed in regal attire, complete with a crown, but his expression is one of detached arrogance and stubbornness. A single, bright ray of light shines down from above, illuminating him and emphasizing his belief in the Divine Right of Kings. However, the light casts long, distorted shadows around him, hinting at the consequences of his actions. In the foreground, partially obscured by shadows, are symbolic representations of the Houses of Parliament â€“ a quill pen resting on a scroll (representing legislation) and a simple wooden chair (representing the common people). These are intentionally placed in shadow, signifying Charles I's disregard for Parliament. Cracks are visible on the walls of the throne room, and dust motes dance in the single ray of light, symbolizing the decay and instability of his reign. The overall composition should evoke a sense of impending doom and the fragility of absolute power when divorced from the will of the people. The background should subtly fade into a blurred, indistinct representation of the Tower of London, hinting at his eventual fate.
