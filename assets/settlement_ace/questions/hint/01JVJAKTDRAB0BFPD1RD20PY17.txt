A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a receding Roman legion marching away from a verdant, rolling English landscape. The scene is bathed in the soft, golden light of a late afternoon sun. The foreground features a weathered Roman centurion, his back to the viewer, clad in traditional armor, his red cape billowing slightly in the breeze. He gazes towards a distant, winding road that disappears over a hill. Behind him, the legion marches in formation, their shields and spears glinting. The landscape is dotted with iconic English elements: ancient oak trees, a stone henge-like formation in the distance, and a winding river. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues and greens for the landscape, with accents of Roman red and gold on the soldiers. The sky is a blend of soft blues and oranges, suggesting a time of change and departure. The composition emphasizes the long passage of time, with the receding legion symbolizing the end of their presence in Britain. The overall feel is historical, peaceful, and evokes a sense of the Roman era drawing to a close in Britain. The image should be strictly 2D with a 16:9 aspect ratio.
