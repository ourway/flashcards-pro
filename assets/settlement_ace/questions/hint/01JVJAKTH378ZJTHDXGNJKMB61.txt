A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a whimsical yet geographically informative scene. On the left side, representing Wales, a misty, green valley dotted with grazing sheep. A traditional Welsh cottage with a slate roof sits nestled amongst the hills. On the right side, representing Northern Ireland, a vibrant breakfast table is laden with Ulster Fry. The Ulster Fry includes sausages, bacon, fried egg, black and white pudding, and soda bread. A faint, stylized map outlines each country behind the respective scene, Wales in a muted red hue and Northern Ireland in a soft blue. A symbolic, broken line visually separates the two scenes, emphasizing the geographical and culinary distinction. The colour palette leans towards pastel shades, with gentle greens for Wales and warm yellows and browns for the Ulster Fry, creating a comforting and memorable image. The overall style should evoke a sense of classic British countryside and culinary tradition.
