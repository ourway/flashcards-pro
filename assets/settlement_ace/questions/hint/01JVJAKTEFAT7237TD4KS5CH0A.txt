A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the Battle of Hastings. The scene focuses on the clash between Norman and Saxon armies in the center of a gently sloping green field. Dominating the composition is William the Conqueror on horseback, clad in shining armor with a Norman banner displaying a golden lion. His expression is determined, his sword raised, leading his Norman knights forward. Facing him is a line of Saxon soldiers, shields interlocked, their King Harold Godwinson visible in the center, an arrow piercing his eye. The background features a clear, bright sky with a hint of clouds, reminiscent of the English countryside. Scattered across the battlefield are fallen soldiers, broken weapons, and heraldic shields bearing Norman and Saxon symbols. The colors are primarily pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly echoing the UK flag, with touches of gold and silver for the armor and weaponry. The overall composition should convey both the chaos and the historical significance of the Norman invasion, emphasizing the leadership of William and the tragic fate of Harold. The style should be reminiscent of historical tapestries and illuminated manuscripts, creating a visually rich and memorable image.
