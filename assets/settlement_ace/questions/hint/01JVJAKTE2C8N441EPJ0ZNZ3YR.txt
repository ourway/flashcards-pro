A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image, 16:9 ratio, depicting two opposing medieval armies clashing on a vast, rolling green field under a turbulent sky. The English army, positioned on the left, prominently features soldiers bearing the St. George's Cross on their shields and banners, charging forward with longbows and spears. Their armor is a mix of polished steel and heraldic colors, primarily reds and whites, subtly echoing the English flag. The French army, on the right, displays the Fleur-de-lis on their banners and shields, advancing with swords and axes. Their armor incorporates blues and golds, reminiscent of the French royal colors. In the foreground, a fallen knight lies between the armies, his armor reflecting the somber sky, symbolizing the extended conflict and its human cost. The field is dotted with wildflowers, adding a touch of poignant beauty to the scene of war. The overall color palette leans towards muted pastel tones, with strategic pops of red, white, and blue to subtly allude to both nations' flags. The art style should be realistic, capturing the details of medieval weaponry and armor, while also conveying the emotional intensity of the battle. The composition should emphasize the scale and duration of the conflict, with the armies stretching into the distance, suggesting a war that spanned generations. The sky above is filled with dark, swirling clouds, hinting at the long and arduous nature of the Hundred Years War.
