A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration, 16:9 landscape. The central focus is the White Tower, a prominent keep within the Tower of London complex. The tower is rendered in creamy white stone, showcasing its Norman architecture with rounded arches and sturdy battlements. Above the tower, a stylized royal standard of the United Kingdom flutters gently in a pastel blue sky. Inside the tower, suggested by a subtly glowing light emanating from the windows, are faint outlines of crowns, scepters, and orbs, symbolizing the Crown Jewels. The overall color palette is a blend of pastel blues, reds, and whites, echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The foreground depicts a manicured green lawn leading up to the tower, dotted with stylized, vibrant red poppies, a symbol of remembrance and the UK's natural beauty. The composition is designed to emphasize the tower's imposing presence and historical significance, while the soft watercolor style and pastel palette create an approachable and educational aesthetic. The light should be soft and diffused, and shadows should be minimal.
