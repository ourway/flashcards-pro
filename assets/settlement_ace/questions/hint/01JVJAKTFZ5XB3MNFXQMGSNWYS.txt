A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolour style (16:9 landscape). The central focus is a large, stylized, white dove, wings outstretched in a gesture of peace and protection. The dove hovers gently over a miniature world map, rendered in soft pastel blues and greens. The world map is not highly detailed but features recognizable continental outlines. Emanating from the dove's wings are subtle, radiating lines of soft blue and white, suggesting a protective aura. Below the dove and the world map, depict a collection of simplified, diverse human figures holding hands in a circle. These figures are small and rendered in pastel skin tones, wearing simple, colourful clothing that subtly hints at various cultures around the world. The background is a wash of soft, blended pastel colours, primarily blues and whites, resembling a peaceful sky. There are no sharp edges or harsh lines; everything is soft and flowing. The overall impression is one of serenity, protection, and unity. The colours should evoke the calming aspect of the UK flag, and the dove should be the main focal point, symbolizing the prevention of war. The image should be free of any text or numbers.
