A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a somber scene representing Mary, Queen of Scots' imprisonment. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, greys, and muted reds, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The central focus is Mary, Queen of Scots, depicted as a woman in her late 30s, with auburn hair and wearing a simple, dark blue gown. She is sitting on a stone bench inside a tall, circular tower room. The room is sparsely furnished with a small wooden table and a pitcher of water. Through a barred window, a flock of twenty fluffy, white sheep are visible in a misty, green Scottish landscape. Each sheep has a tiny, almost imperceptible, crown on its head, symbolizing Mary's lost royalty. Mary's gaze is fixed on the sheep, her expression a mixture of sadness, resignation, and longing. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet contemplation and the slow passage of time. The light should be soft and diffused, emanating from the window and casting long shadows across the room. The artist should focus on capturing the textures of the stone walls, the wool of the sheep, and the fabric of Mary's dress, adding depth and realism to the scene. The composition should emphasize the isolation and confinement of Mary within the tower, with the vast landscape representing the freedom she has lost.
