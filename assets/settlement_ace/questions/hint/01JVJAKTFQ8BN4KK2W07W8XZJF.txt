A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, depicting a field of poppies under a pastel dawn sky. The composition is centered around a weathered, overturned artillery gun, its barrel partially buried in the poppy field. The gun is rendered in muted grey tones with subtle rust detailing, conveying its age and disuse. Draped softly over the gun barrel is a tattered Union Jack flag, its colors faded and worn, symbolizing the sacrifices made during the war. Around the gun, vibrant red poppies bloom in abundance, their delicate petals contrasting sharply with the cold steel of the weapon. The sky transitions from a deep indigo at the horizon to soft pastel pinks and blues higher up, signifying hope and remembrance. Several white doves are taking flight from the field, ascending into the dawning sky, representing peace and the end of conflict. The overall color palette leans towards the pastel shades of the sky, with the red of the poppies providing a powerful focal point and a somber reminder of the lives lost. The style should be realistic and detailed, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements to create a respectful and memorable visual representation of the war's end.
