A hand-drawn, realistic 2D illustration in a watercolor style, depicting a visually appealing and heartwarming scene representing Mothering Sunday. The artwork should be in a 16:9 landscape format, with the main subject centered. The colour palette should be pastel. The illustration features a pastel pink and white striped vase, elegantly holding a vibrant bouquet of spring flowers. The flowers include daffodils (bright yellow), tulips (a mix of pastel pink and white), and hyacinths (soft lavender and blue). The arrangement should look lush and full, symbolizing appreciation and love. Beside the vase, slightly overlapping, lies a pastel pink greeting card, delicately decorated with an embossed floral design. A small, ornate heart-shaped box of chocolates, wrapped in light blue paper and tied with a white satin ribbon, sits near the card. The background is a soft, blurred wash of pastel yellow and green, suggesting a bright, sunny spring day. The overall composition should evoke a sense of warmth, affection, and the traditional, heartfelt gifts associated with Mothering Sunday in the UK. The style should be reminiscent of classic botanical illustrations with a touch of whimsical charm.
