A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a dynamic rugby match. The composition is centered on a rugby scrum, with players from six distinct teams fiercely contesting the ball. Each team is subtly distinguished by their jersey colors, reflecting the flags of the Six Nations: England (white with a hint of red), Scotland (navy blue), Wales (red), Ireland (green), France (blue), and Italy (azure blue). The backdrop features a stylized representation of iconic landmarks from each nation, blended seamlessly: a faint outline of the Tower of London, Edinburgh Castle, Snowdonia mountain range, the Cliffs of Moher, the Eiffel Tower, and the Colosseum. The sky is a soft pastel blue, reminiscent of a crisp winter day. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, punctuated by the bolder hues of the team jerseys. The ground is realistically rendered with mud and grass. The players' expressions convey determination and grit. The art style aims for realism and accuracy, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, to ensure the image is both educational and visually appealing. The ratio is 16:9, landscape.
