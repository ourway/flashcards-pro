A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a citizenship ceremony scene. The image is composed with a 16:9 aspect ratio, focusing on the central area. The colour palette leans towards the pastel shades of blue and red, reminiscent of the UK flag. The scene is set within a grand hall, suggested by subtle architectural details like arched windows letting in soft light. The central figure is a woman with a warm, welcoming expression, slightly elevated on a small podium. She is dressed in smart, official attire, perhaps a subtly styled skirt suit in a light pastel blue. Before her stands a group of diverse individuals, their faces radiating hope and pride. One individual, positioned slightly forward, is depicted with their hand raised in a gesture of affirmation, their mouth slightly open as if speaking. The focus is on this act of verbal commitment. Around the periphery of the group, other figures stand attentively, their expressions reflecting the solemnity and joy of the occasion. The background includes soft, blurred details of the hall, suggesting a sense of tradition and importance without distracting from the central action. Light should be diffused, creating a gentle and respectful atmosphere. The overall impression should be one of sincerity, commitment, and the spoken word, reinforcing the idea of affirming or swearing an oath of loyalty.
