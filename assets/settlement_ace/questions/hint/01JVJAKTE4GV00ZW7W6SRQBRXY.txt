A whimsical, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, capturing a scene from "A Midsummer Night's Dream." The image, in a 16:9 landscape ratio, centers on a moonlit forest glade, bathed in soft, pastel blues and purples reminiscent of a summer twilight. In the foreground, Titania, the Queen of the Fairies, reclines on a bed of vibrant bluebells, her flowing gown a mix of pastel greens and whites. She is surrounded by tiny fairies with translucent, butterfly-like wings in shades of pink and lavender. One fairy offers her a dewdrop on a large, heart-shaped leaf. To Titania's right, a donkey wearing a comical floral crown peeks through the foliage. In the background, silhouetted against the moonlit sky, are entwined trees, their branches adorned with glowing fireflies. The overall composition evokes a sense of magic, romance, and dreamy enchantment, fitting for a Shakespearean comedy. The color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, purple, green, and pink to enhance the dreamlike quality, with subtle highlights to create depth and texture. The drawing style should resemble classical book illustrations, with a focus on botanical details and ethereal lighting.
