A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a scene representing the 18th-century Enlightenment. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, creams, and faded reds, subtly echoing the Union Jack's colors. The central focus is a grand, open book resting on a sturdy oak table. Emanating from the book are radiant beams of light, not harsh but soft and illuminating, casting a warm glow on the surrounding objects. These beams symbolize the innovative ideas in politics, philosophy, and science that characterized the Enlightenment. Around the book, arrange symbolic objects: a quill and inkwell representing the writing and dissemination of new ideas; a telescope pointed upwards, signifying scientific exploration and discovery; a globe, partially lit by the book's light, representing the global impact of these new philosophies; and a stack of bound manuscripts, each subtly hinting at different disciplines (politics, philosophy, science). The background is a softly rendered library interior with arched windows allowing diffused light to filter in, furthering the sense of enlightenment. The overall composition should convey a sense of intellectual awakening and the transformative power of knowledge, capturing the essence of the Enlightenment movement. The light should appear natural and soft, as if from a candle.
