A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, showcasing Queen Victoria in her later years, around the turn of the 20th century. She is seated regally on an ornate throne within Buckingham Palace, bathed in soft, diffused light filtering through large, arched windows. The throne is crafted from dark, polished wood and inlaid with subtle gold detailing, featuring the royal coat of arms subtly etched into the back. Queen Victoria wears a black mourning dress adorned with delicate lace, reflecting her perpetual state of mourning after Prince Albert's death. A small, jeweled crown rests atop her head, and she holds a scepter in her right hand. The background features a glimpse of the palace gardens through the windows, with meticulously rendered rose bushes in full bloom. The colour palette leans towards muted pastels with touches of royal blue and crimson in the throne's upholstery and the distant flags visible in the garden, subtly echoing the colours of the Union Jack. The overall composition is symmetrical and balanced, emphasizing Queen Victoria's central position and conveying a sense of enduring power and historical significance. The light and shadow should be rendered delicately, creating depth and texture in the fabrics and architectural details. The image should evoke a sense of Victorian grandeur and solemnity, acting as a visual cue to the queen's long reign.
