A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Queen Elizabeth II during a state visit. The scene unfolds on a grand, subtly stylized tarmac with a red carpet leading to a royal aircraft subtly marked with a British emblem. The queen, adorned in a regal yet approachable pastel blue dress suit and a small diamond tiara, is shaking hands with a foreign dignitary. The dignitary is dressed in formal attire representative of their nation, with subtle design elements hinting at a Middle Eastern country (e.g., a Keffiyeh headscarf). In the background, subtly blurred but recognizable, are elements representing both the UK and the foreign country: a stylized Big Ben and a landmark building from the Middle Eastern country. The composition should be centered, focusing on the interaction between the Queen and the dignitary. The color palette leans towards soft pastels, with strategic uses of red, white, and blue (the colors of the UK flag) to subtly emphasize the British identity. The overall atmosphere should convey diplomacy, respect, and the fostering of international relations. The style should evoke a sense of historical significance and contemporary relevance. The sky is a soft, watercolour wash of pastel blue and pink, suggesting early morning or late afternoon, to further enhance the peaceful and diplomatic tone.
