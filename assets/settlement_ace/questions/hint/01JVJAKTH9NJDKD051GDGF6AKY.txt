A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor painting in a pastel color palette (primarily blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag), depicting a stylized map of the United Kingdom. The map should be centrally positioned in the 16:9 landscape frame. England, Wales and Northern Ireland should be pale blue. Scotland, prominently featured, is colored a warm pastel red. Superimposed over Scotland is a stylized representation of eight sheep, carefully arranged to visually suggest the percentage. The sheep are fluffy and white, with subtle shading to give them depth. The backdrop behind the UK map is a faint, textured parchment color, suggesting historical documents and the long history of the UK. The overall composition should be clean and uncluttered, ensuring the focus remains on Scotland and the eight sheep. The art style should evoke classic British watercolor landscapes, emphasizing detail and subtle washes of color. The sheep should be drawn realistically but with a touch of whimsy, making them memorable and engaging. The map should be accurate in its general outline but simplified for clarity, avoiding excessive detail that would distract from the central concept. The shadows should be soft and consistent, enhancing the depth and realism of the image.
