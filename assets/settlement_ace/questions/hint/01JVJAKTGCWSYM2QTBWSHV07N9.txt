A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a composition depicting a Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) visualized as a confident, middle-aged individual, smartly dressed in a business suit, standing behind a large, oak desk in a bright and modern office. On the desk, arrange symbolic items: a miniature police car, a balanced scale representing justice, and a stylized budget chart depicted as a pie graph. The pie chart should be divided into segments representing different policing priorities, such as neighborhood patrols, cybercrime units, and community outreach programs. The background should subtly feature the silhouette of a typical British townscape at sunrise, with rolling green hills and quaint houses. The color palette should be predominantly pastel blues, creams, and light reds, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag without being overtly patriotic. The overall art style should aim for realism, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and focusing on clear, understandable visual representations. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of transparency and openness, appropriate for a public servant. The composition should emphasize the PCC's role as a planner and decision-maker, directly correlating to the question about determining police priorities and budgets.
