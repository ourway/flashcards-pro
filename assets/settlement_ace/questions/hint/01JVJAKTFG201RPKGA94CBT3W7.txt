A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style (not cartoonish or abstract). The image, in a 16:9 landscape format, depicts Prince Charles in regal attire, centered in the frame. He wears a sophisticated suit with a blue tie and a crest visible on his jacket. He stands against the backdrop of a stylized Welsh landscape. Rolling green hills dotted with white sheep stretch towards the horizon. Dominating the background is a majestic, snow-capped mountain reminiscent of Snowdonia. In his left hand, Prince Charles gently holds a single, vibrant red Welsh poppy (the national flower of Wales). A soft, diffused light bathes the scene, creating a serene and dignified atmosphere. Subtle hints of the Welsh flag colors (red, white, and green) are woven into the landscape and Prince Charles's attire, creating a visual link to Wales. The overall palette leans towards pastel shades, giving the image a gentle, educational feel. The composition is designed to draw the eye to Prince Charles and the poppy, symbolizing his title as the Prince of Wales and his connection to the region.
