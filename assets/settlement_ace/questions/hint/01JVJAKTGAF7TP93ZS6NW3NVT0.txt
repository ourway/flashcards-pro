A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting King Alfred the Great standing on a grassy knoll, overlooking a battlefield. The central focus is on King Alfred, portrayed as a regal figure with a determined expression. He wears a crown adorned with subtle, stylized Celtic knots and a royal blue tunic, partially covered by shining silver armour. He holds a sheathed sword in his right hand, and his left hand rests on a large, intricately detailed shield bearing a stylized emblem of a golden dragon, breathing fire. In the background, a scene unfolds depicting the aftermath of a battle: scattered Viking longboats partially submerged in a misty river, representing their defeat. A few Viking warriors, rendered in muted greys and browns, are seen retreating in disarray. The sky is a blend of soft pastel blues and greys, suggesting a dawn after a long night of conflict. The overall color palette should lean towards the blues, reds, and whites of the UK flag, but in muted, pastel tones to create a serene yet powerful image. The art style should evoke a sense of historical authenticity, reminiscent of medieval tapestries and illuminated manuscripts. The composition should draw the eye to Alfredâ€™s strong, central figure, reinforcing the idea of his leadership and victory. No text should be present in the image.
