A serene, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Island of Iona bathed in the soft, pastel hues of dawn. The central focus is a gentle, white dove (representing Columba) with a halo of soft light around its head, gently landing on a weathered stone Celtic cross. The cross stands prominently near the entrance of a modestly sized, early medieval monastery constructed from grey stone, nestled amidst the island's rolling green hills. The monastery is not overly ornate, reflecting the austerity of the early Christian period. The surrounding landscape features the rugged, natural beauty of Iona, with glimpses of the calm, turquoise sea in the background. A small group of monks, dressed in simple brown robes, are depicted tending a small garden near the monastery, their faces reflecting peace and contemplation. The overall composition should evoke a sense of tranquility, spirituality, and the historical significance of St. Columba's arrival on Iona. The color palette should primarily consist of soft blues, greens, greys, and whites, reminiscent of the Scottish landscape and subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag.
