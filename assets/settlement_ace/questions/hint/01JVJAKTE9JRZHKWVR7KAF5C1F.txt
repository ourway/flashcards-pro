A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a balanced set of scales against a soft, pastel-colored background reminiscent of a serene dawn. One pan of the scale holds symbolic representations of diverse individuals â€“ a young person, an elderly person, a person using a wheelchair, a woman, a man, individuals with different skin tones, and symbols representing various religions and sexual orientations. These figures are delicately rendered, with subtle variations in clothing and appearance to highlight their individuality. The other pan of the scale is empty, symbolizing the concept of fairness and equal treatment under the law. The scales themselves are crafted from polished wood and gleaming brass, evoking a sense of tradition and justice. Soft light filters through the pastel background, illuminating the figures and the scales, creating a sense of serenity and impartiality. The composition is centered, ensuring all elements are balanced and harmonious within the 16:9 aspect ratio. The overall color palette leans towards soft blues, pinks, and creams, providing a calming and reassuring visual experience. The style is reminiscent of classic legal illustrations, emphasizing clarity and precision.
