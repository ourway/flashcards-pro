A vividly coloured, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a vintage sports poster, depicting two distinct rugby scenes. On the left side, a dynamic rugby match unfolds on a lush green field, representing the Six Nations Championship. Six national flags—England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France, and Italy—are subtly incorporated as banners fluttering in the background, their colours reflected in the players' jerseys and the crowd's attire. The players are engaged in a fierce scrum, showcasing the intensity and national pride associated with the tournament. The right side of the image portrays a rugby match within a modern stadium, symbolizing The Super League. Club emblems are subtly visible on the players' jerseys and on banners adorning the stadium. The stadium lights shine brightly, illuminating the action and reflecting the professional and high-energy atmosphere of club rugby. A stylised rugby ball, textured with intricate stitching, is positioned in the very centre of the image, acting as a visual bridge between the two scenes. The colour palette leans towards the pastel tones, with occasional strong reds, blues, and whites, mirroring the colours of the UK flag and creating a cohesive and visually appealing composition. The overall impression should be one of energy, competition, and the rich heritage of rugby in the UK.
