A whimsical, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of Beatrix Potter's illustrations, depicting a scene of playful trickery on April 1st. The setting is a quaint English village green with rolling green hills in the background under a pastel blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. In the center, a young boy with rosy cheeks and tousled brown hair, wearing a red and white striped shirt and blue shorts, is carefully placing a rubber chicken on the park bench where an elderly gentleman with a tweed jacket and spectacles is about to sit. The gentleman is holding a newspaper and a cup of tea, blissfully unaware of the prank. A small, mischievous grin is on the boy's face. To the side, a young girl with bright red hair in pigtails, wearing a white dress with blue polka dots, is hiding behind a large oak tree, stifling a giggle while holding a whoopee cushion. A robin perches on a branch above her, seemingly observing the scene with amusement. The overall color palette should be soft and pastel, dominated by blues, greens, reds and whites, evoking a sense of lighthearted fun and springtime in the UK. The composition should emphasize the anticipation and humor of the situation, capturing the essence of April Fools' Day.
