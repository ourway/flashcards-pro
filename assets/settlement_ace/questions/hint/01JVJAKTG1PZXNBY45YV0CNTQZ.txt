A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a scene of Vaisakhi celebrations under a clear, pastel blue sky. The composition is centered around a group of people joyfully participating in traditional Vaisakhi activities. In the foreground, a group of dancers dressed in colorful Punjabi attire perform the Bhangra, their movements energetic and full of life. The colors of their clothing – deep reds, vibrant yellows, and lush greens – pop against the background. Behind the dancers, there's a depiction of a Nagar Kirtan procession, with people carrying the Nishan Sahib (Sikh flag) and singing hymns. The Nishan Sahib is a saffron-colored flag with the Sikh symbol, the Khanda, prominently displayed. The procession moves past a field of golden wheat, representing the harvest season celebrated during Vaisakhi. The wheat field is slightly swaying in the breeze. The overall colour palette should resemble the UK flag or be in a pastel colour palette. The sun is shining, casting a warm, cheerful glow over the scene. The image should evoke a feeling of joy, community, and celebration, directly linking the visual to the festive nature of Vaisakhi. The ratio is 16:9.
