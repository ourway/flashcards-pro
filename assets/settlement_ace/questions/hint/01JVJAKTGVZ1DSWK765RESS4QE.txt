A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style depicting a grand, ornate Romanesque archway bathed in the soft, pastel hues of dawn. The archway, constructed from light grey stone, stands as a symbolic entrance to a flourishing European landscape visible beyond. Framing the arch are blossoming olive branches, their leaves a delicate pastel green, intertwined with sprigs of lavender in full bloom, their flowers a gentle purple. At the keystone of the arch, instead of a traditional architectural feature, there's a subtly embedded, almost ethereal representation of interconnected gears, symbolizing economic cooperation and progress. These gears are rendered in muted gold and copper tones, suggesting historical significance. The landscape visible through the archway shows rolling hills of vineyards in pastel yellows and oranges, representing the agricultural heart of Europe, dotted with quaint villages and towns rendered in soft blues and pinks. Above, a flock of doves, each drawn with careful detail to their plumage, soars towards the horizon, symbolizing peace and unity. The overall composition should evoke a sense of historical importance, optimism, and the foundational nature of the event, with the pastel colour palette contributing to a sense of timelessness and understated grandeur, avoiding any harsh or modern elements. The image should be strictly 2D, with no text or numbers included.
