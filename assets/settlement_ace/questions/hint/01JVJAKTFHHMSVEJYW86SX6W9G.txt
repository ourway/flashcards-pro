A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Houses of Parliament bathed in a soft, pastel-toned morning light. The central focus is on the iconic clock tower, Big Ben, rendered with intricate detail, showcasing its neo-Gothic architecture. A subtle, recurring pattern of stylized calendars, each opened to a single week, gently overlays the scene, creating a visual rhythm that emphasizes the weekly nature of the event. These calendars are rendered in pastel shades of blue and red, subtly referencing the UK flag. In the foreground, a stylized quill rests on a stack of official-looking documents tied with a red ribbon, symbolizing the official proceedings. The overall composition evokes a sense of British history, tradition, and the regular cadence of parliamentary life. The sky is a blend of pastel blues and pinks, with soft, diffused clouds adding depth to the scene. No text or numbers should be present in the image. The artwork should be high resolution, suitable for educational purposes and designed to be memorable and easily understood. The ratio should be 16:9.
