A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a lush Welsh landscape under a pastel blue sky. Rolling green hills dominate the scene, dotted with grazing sheep and traditional stone cottages with slate roofs. In the foreground, a field bursts with bright yellow daffodils in full bloom, their petals delicately rendered with fine brushstrokes. At the center of the composition, a figure representing St. David stands on a small hillock, wearing simple, flowing robes in shades of white and light blue. He holds a bishop's staff made of polished wood, topped with a simple Celtic cross. Around his feet, more daffodils sprout from the earth, symbolizing his connection to Wales. The overall color palette should be dominated by pastel shades of green, yellow, blue, and white, creating a soft and inviting atmosphere. The composition should be balanced, drawing the eye towards St. David and the daffodils, visually linking him to the Welsh landscape and the celebration of St. David's Day. The sky should feature subtle watercolor washes, creating a sense of depth and atmosphere.
