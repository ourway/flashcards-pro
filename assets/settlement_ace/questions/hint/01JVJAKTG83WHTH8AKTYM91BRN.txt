A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. The stadium should be centrally positioned within the 16:9 frame. The architecture of the Millennium Stadium should be accurately represented, showcasing its distinctive retractable roof partially open, allowing light to spill onto the lush green rugby pitch inside. The surrounding cityscape of Cardiff should be visible in the background, featuring the River Taff flowing gently nearby. The sky above should be a soft pastel blue, with hints of white clouds resembling sheep, subtly nodding to Welsh countryside imagery. Incorporate the colors of the Welsh flag - red, white, and green - into the elements of the painting: perhaps red accents in the stadium's architecture, white highlights on the river's surface, and varying shades of green in the surrounding parkland and rugby pitch. The overall composition should evoke a sense of national pride and the importance of Cardiff as a major city in the UK, focusing on the iconic Millennium Stadium as its centrepiece. The light should be soft and diffused, giving the scene a warm and inviting feel, akin to a beautiful postcard.
