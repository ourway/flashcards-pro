A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a blossoming orchard under a clear, pastel blue sky. The orchard is filled with fruit trees in full bloom, their branches laden with delicate pink and white blossoms. Beneath the trees, a group of Sikh people, dressed in traditional clothing featuring pastel orange, yellow, and blue hues, are joyfully celebrating Vaisakhi. Some are dancing to the beat of a dhol drum, while others are sharing food and drink. A central focal point is a Nishan Sahib (Sikh flag) fluttering gently in the breeze, adorned with orange and blue colors that evoke the UK flag while maintaining a pastel color scheme. The ground is covered in a carpet of fallen blossoms, creating a soft, diffused light. The overall composition should convey a sense of joy, community, and the arrival of spring, visually anchoring the Vaisakhi celebration to the month of April. The background includes rolling green hills in the distance, further emphasizing the connection to nature and the season. The light should be soft and diffused, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.
