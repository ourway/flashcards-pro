A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a grand Tudor-era royal bedchamber bathed in soft, diffused light filtering through a leaded glass window. The focal point is a young, frail-looking boy, Edward VI, lying in a large, ornate four-poster bed. He is dressed in regal attire, including a velvet robe trimmed with ermine. His face is pale, but his eyes are intelligent and thoughtful. Beside the bed stands a somber-looking physician in traditional Tudor garb, holding a closed book. The room is richly decorated with tapestries depicting scenes of English history, and a coat of arms with the Tudor rose is prominently displayed above the fireplace. On a table near the bed, there is a partially eaten bowl of fruit and a quill lying beside an open book. The color palette should be primarily pastel blues, reds, and creams, echoing the colors of the UK flag but in muted tones. A subtle halo of light surrounds the boy's head, symbolizing his youth and the brevity of his reign. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet dignity and impending loss, creating a memorable and poignant visual representation of Edward VI's short life. The composition should draw the eye to the boy's face, emphasizing his youthful features.
