A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, rendered in a pastel color palette, depicting Queen Elizabeth II. She is seated regally on a throne positioned centrally within the frame (16:9 aspect ratio). The throne is ornately carved with symbols of the United Kingdom - roses (England), thistles (Scotland), daffodils (Wales), and shamrocks (Northern Ireland). The background features a subtle, repeating pattern of the Royal Standard flag, faded and muted to avoid distracting from the main subject. Queen Elizabeth II is wearing the Imperial State Crown, its jewels rendered with shimmering detail. She is also wearing a long, flowing gown in a light blue hue, adorned with delicate embroidery. In her right hand, she holds the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross, and in her left, the Sovereign's Orb, both gleaming with gold and precious stones. The overall composition should evoke a sense of history, tradition, and the enduring nature of the British monarchy, with a soft, respectful, and dignified tone. The artistic style should be reminiscent of classic royal portraiture but with a modern watercolor sensibility, emphasizing light and shadow to create depth and realism. The pastel color palette should give the image a timeless and elegant feel.
