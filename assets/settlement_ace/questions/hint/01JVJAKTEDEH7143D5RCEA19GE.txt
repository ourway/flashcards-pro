A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting a pivotal scene related to the Magna Carta in 1215. The primary focus is King John, his expression conveying a mix of reluctance and defiance, seated at a sturdy, oak table laden with quill pens and parchment. He is dressed in regal attire, a crimson robe trimmed with ermine, subtly echoing the red in the Union Jack. Before him stands a group of determined barons, their faces etched with resolve, dressed in clothing of the era, with a subtle pastel blue hue. In the center of the composition, a large, ornate scroll, representing the Magna Carta, is partially unfurled, its seal prominently displayed. Sunlight streams in from a stained-glass window in the background, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene; the stained glass depicts symbolic imagery of justice and law, with colors that subtly incorporate the white of the UK flag. The background architecture should evoke a medieval English castle hall, with stone walls and arched windows. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with muted reds, blues, and creams dominating to create a sense of historical gravitas and the importance of the event. The composition should emphasize the power dynamic shift, with the barons presenting a united front to a king yielding some of his power. The artistic style should be realistic, detailed, but with the soft touch of watercolor, avoiding harsh lines or overly dramatic expressions.
