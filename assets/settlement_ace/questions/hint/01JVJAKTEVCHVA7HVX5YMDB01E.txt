A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the High Court of Scotland. The primary color scheme uses a pastel palette, with subtle hints of blue and red reminiscent of the UK flag. The composition is centered on a grand, imposing stone building, its architecture reflecting a blend of Scottish Baronial and Gothic styles. The High Court building is significantly taller than the surrounding structures, emphasizing its importance and the 'High' in its name. A gentle, rolling green landscape surrounds the court, dotted with stylized Scottish thistles and heather. The sky above is a soft, pastel blue with delicate, hand-painted clouds. The building's entrance features intricately carved details, and a subtle light emanates from the windows, suggesting activity and justice within. The overall mood is one of solemnity and respect, with the image intended to evoke a sense of the gravity and importance of the cases heard within the High Court. The image should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and cultural significance, reflecting the Scottish legal system's heritage.
