A watercolour-style illustration depicting a serene Scottish landscape under a pastel sky, with rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep. In the foreground, a distinguished, elderly figure wearing traditional Scottish attire, including a kilt and a moderator's robe (but not overly ornate), stands on a stone platform. He is holding a symbolic hourglass, with sand noticeably running out. The hourglass is positioned slightly to the left of the frame's center. To the right of the frame's center, a younger, similarly dressed figure stands waiting, with a gentle smile, holding a closed book, subtly representing knowledge and succession. The colour palette should lean towards pastel blues, greens, and creams, interspersed with the tartan colours of red, green, and blue. The overall composition emphasizes the passage of time and the cyclical nature of leadership. The scene should convey a sense of calm transition and temporary stewardship, reflecting the one-year term. The style should be realistic but gentle, with soft brushstrokes and a focus on capturing the light and atmosphere of the Scottish Highlands. The figures should be drawn with detailed facial expressions conveying wisdom and anticipation. The hourglass should be particularly detailed, with visible grains of sand and a delicate glass structure. The Scottish landscape should be a backdrop and not the main focus of the image.
