A vibrant, detailed watercolor painting in a realistic style depicting the Grand National horse race. The composition focuses on a group of horses and jockeys leaping over a challenging fence, with a large crowd of spectators visible in the background. The horses are a mix of brown, black, and white, each with a brightly colored saddle cloth. The jockeys are dressed in traditional racing silks, their faces showing determination. The fence is high and imposing, with a water-filled ditch on the landing side. The background features the iconic Aintree Racecourse grandstand, rendered in soft pastel colors. The overall palette leans towards the red, white, and blue of the UK flag, with touches of green representing the grassy course. The sky is a light, airy blue with scattered clouds. The image should evoke a sense of excitement and grandeur, capturing the essence of the Grand National as a significant sporting event. The focus is on the horses and the jump, emphasizing the 'true' nature of the race.
