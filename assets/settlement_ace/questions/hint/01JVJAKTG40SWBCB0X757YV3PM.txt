A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a bustling medieval town square in England, circa late 14th century. The scene is bathed in soft, pastel hues, primarily blues, creams, and muted reds, reminiscent of the UK flag's color palette. Dominating the central composition is a tiered arrangement of figures, visually emphasizing the concept of a "middle" class. At the base, common laborers – blacksmiths, farmers, and weavers – are actively engaged in their trades. Above them, elevated slightly, stands a group representing the emerging middle class: merchants in fine, but not extravagant, clothing are bargaining, a skilled artisan is displaying his wares, and a town official is overseeing the market activity. These individuals are slightly more well-fed and better dressed than the laborers below, signifying their improved economic status. Above them, and occupying the top and smallest tier of the composition, are members of the aristocracy, observing the scene with a detached air. The architecture reflects the social strata: simple, functional buildings at the base, more elaborate and decorated structures for the middle class, and a distant view of a grand manor house on a hill. The overall composition should convey a sense of upward mobility and the burgeoning economic activity that characterized the rise of the middle class, focusing on the "middle" tier as the central point of interest. The light should be soft and diffused, highlighting the details of the clothing, architecture, and the expressions on the faces of the figures. The style should be reminiscent of illuminated manuscripts, with clear outlines and detailed rendering.
