A vibrant, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration depicting a classic English cricket scene interrupted by a sudden downpour. The scene is set on a lush green cricket field, with a traditional village backdrop of rolling hills and quaint cottages with red roofs. In the foreground, two cricket players, one poised to bat and the other fielding, are caught mid-action. The batsman is wearing traditional white cricket attire, his bat raised, while the fielder is in a dynamic pose, ready to catch the ball. A traditional cricket pavilion, painted white with a red roof, stands slightly behind the players. The sky, initially a bright, pastel blue, is now overtaken by dark, grey rain clouds. Thick streaks of rain are visibly pouring down, obscuring the scene slightly but not completely. Puddles are beginning to form on the cricket pitch. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with accents of red (roofs, cricket ball) and blue (sky peeking through the clouds). The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, aiming for a detailed and evocative representation of a quintessential English summer scene disrupted by rain. The composition is centered on the cricket players and the downpour, emphasizing the phrase "rain stopped play" in a visually memorable way. The image should evoke a sense of nostalgia and the typical unpredictable British weather.
