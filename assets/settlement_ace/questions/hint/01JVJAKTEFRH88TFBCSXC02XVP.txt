A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh. The building should be centrally positioned within the 16:9 landscape frame. The architectural details of the Parliament should be rendered with precision, showcasing its modern design while subtly incorporating traditional Scottish elements like stone textures and geometric patterns reminiscent of Celtic knotwork. The building is bathed in the soft, warm light of a late afternoon sun, casting long shadows that emphasize its form. In the foreground, a meticulously drawn Scottish thistle, its purple blooms vibrant against the muted stone of the Parliament, adds a touch of national identity. The sky above is a pastel blend of blues and whites, mirroring the colors of the Scottish flag, with a few wispy clouds adding depth. The surrounding landscape includes a suggestion of the Edinburgh cityscape, with the silhouette of Arthur's Seat visible in the distance, creating a sense of place. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues, with blues, purples, and soft grays dominating, accented by the warmer tones of the setting sun, creating a tranquil and memorable scene. The image should evoke a sense of pride and history, symbolizing the Scottish government's presence in Edinburgh.
