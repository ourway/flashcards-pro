A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Oliver Cromwell standing in a grand hall reminiscent of the Palace of Westminster. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds and whites, subtly echoing the Union Jack. Cromwell is not wearing a crown but is instead dressed in the attire of a Lord Protector: a dark, slightly worn doublet, breeches, and sturdy boots. He stands beside a table draped with a rich, dark blue cloth. Upon the table rests a simple, sheathed sword and a document sealed with wax, bearing the inscription "Lord Protector." Light streams in from a high window, illuminating Cromwell's face, which should convey a stern but thoughtful expression. In the background, partially obscured by shadow, are the faint outlines of royal portraits, hinting at the monarchy he replaced but never embraced. The overall composition should emphasize the contrast between Cromwell's position of power and his deliberate avoidance of the traditional royal title, conveying the idea that he was a leader of a different kind. There should be no crown or any other royal regalia anywhere in the image. The architectural details of the hall should be historically accurate, but softened by the watercolor medium.
