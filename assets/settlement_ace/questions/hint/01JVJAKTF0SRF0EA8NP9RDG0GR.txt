A watercolour painting in a realistic style, ratio 16:9. The scene depicts a stylized, hand-drawn representation of interconnected, symbolic imagery. The central focus is a tightly closed, antique wooden medicine chest, ornately carved with subtle floral patterns reminiscent of Victorian-era design. The chest is painted in pastel blue, with the carvings in a slightly darker shade of blue. Emanating from the chest are faint, ethereal wisps of smoke in pastel pink and white, swirling upwards and outwards.

Surrounding the medicine chest, arranged in a semi-circle, are various symbolic representations: a poppy flower (symbolizing opium), its petals a faded pastel pink, a coca leaf with pastel green leaves and white flowers, and a shattered syringe made of clear glass. Each element is rendered with meticulous detail. The background is a soft, gradient wash of pastel colours, transitioning from light blue at the top to a light pink at the bottom. The overall effect should evoke a sense of caution and fragility, emphasizing the hidden dangers associated with these substances without being overtly graphic or alarming. The composition aims to create a memorable visual link between the chest (representing the source or category) and the items surrounding it (representing specific examples), reinforcing the concept of classification under the umbrella term "drugs".
