A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a serene yet dramatic Scottish Highland landscape at dawn. Dominating the center of the 16:9 frame is a majestic mountain range, its peaks kissed by the first light of day, rendered in shades of purple, grey, and ochre. In the foreground, a tranquil loch reflects the sky, mirroring the pastel hues of blue and pink. A solitary Scottish thistle, rendered in exquisite detail with sharp thorns and a vibrant purple flower, stands prominently on the left side of the loch, its roots intertwined with heather. On the right side of the loch, a weathered stone cairn sits silently, hinting at the passage of time and history. Wisps of mist curl around the lower slopes of the mountains, adding an ethereal quality to the scene. The overall composition should evoke a sense of Scottish pride, resilience, and the enduring beauty of the Highlands. Subtle visual cues, such as the heather and thistle, reinforce the Scottish identity. The color palette should be predominantly pastel, with muted blues, pinks, purples, and greens, creating a peaceful and reflective atmosphere. The artwork should feel both timeless and evocative of Scotland's rich cultural heritage.
