A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting a quintessential pre-18th century British agricultural scene. The image should be in a 16:9 landscape format, dominated by rolling green hills under a pastel blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. In the foreground, a farmer and his family are harvesting wheat in a golden field. The farmer, dressed in simple, earthy-toned clothing, swings a scythe, while his wife and children gather the cut wheat into bundles. A quaint, thatched-roof cottage nestles at the foot of the hills, with smoke gently curling from its chimney, implying a sense of domesticity and rural life. A small flock of sheep grazes peacefully in a nearby pasture, further emphasizing the agricultural nature of the scene. The color palette should be predominantly greens, golds, and blues, with touches of red in the farmer's neckerchief and the wildflowers scattered throughout the field, subtly referencing the UK flag. The overall style should evoke a sense of nostalgia and the simple, hardworking life that characterized pre-industrial Britain, and the realistic drawing style should capture the textures of the wheat, the fabric of the clothing, and the weathered stone of the cottage. The light should be soft and warm, suggesting a late summer afternoon.
