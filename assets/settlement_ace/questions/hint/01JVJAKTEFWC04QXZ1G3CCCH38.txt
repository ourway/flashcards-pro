A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a split composition, visually representing the contrast between Anne of Cleves's origin and the incorrect association with Spain. On the left side, depict a stylized, simplified image of a medieval German town. Include half-timbered houses with steeply pitched roofs, a small church with a spire, and a flowing river. Dominant colors are muted blues and greens, with touches of ochre in the buildings. In the foreground, a single, stylized Cleves rose (symbol of the Duchy of Cleves) is prominently displayed. On the right side, show a stylized representation of a Spanish landscape with rolling hills, olive groves, and a distant, sun-drenched Spanish castle. The color palette here leans towards warm oranges, yellows, and reds. A single, stylized Spanish carnation is prominently displayed in the foreground. Separating the two scenes is a cracked, grey stone wall, symbolizing the failed political marriage. Above the wall, the faint silhouette of Henry VIII's crown is visible, suggesting the overarching theme of the question. The overall tone should be educational and historical, avoiding any caricature. The image should aim to create a clear visual distinction between Germany and Spain, linking Anne of Cleves to her true German origin.
