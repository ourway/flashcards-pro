A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, set against a pastel blue background reminiscent of a clear British sky. The central focus is a large, stylized number "1" composed of intertwined pastel red and white ribbons, echoing the colours of the Union Jack. Within the loop of the "1", depict a group of diverse individuals representing the UK population, carefully arranged to show proportion. Among them, prominently feature a Sikh man wearing a traditional turban, rendered with fine detail to highlight the fabric's texture and colour. Around the base of the number "1," subtly include symbolic elements representing the UK: a sprig of heather (Scotland), a daffodil (Wales), and a rose (England), all rendered in soft pastel shades. The composition should convey a sense of unity and diversity, with the Sikh man as a distinct yet integrated part of the larger group, visually emphasizing the "1%" representation. The overall tone should be respectful, educational, and artistically engaging, avoiding any stereotypes or caricatures. The colour palette should be dominated by pastel blues, reds, and whites, with subtle hints of greens and yellows in the floral elements. The rendering should be realistic, with attention to detail in the clothing, facial features, and textures, making the image both informative and aesthetically pleasing.
