A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The artwork features a serene scene set against a backdrop reminiscent of the rolling green hills of the English countryside under a pastel sky. In the center, two figures are depicted dressed in traditional Hindu attire. One figure is male, wearing a dhoti and the other is female, wearing a sari. They stand close together, symbolizing unity and community. These two figures are positioned on a slightly elevated platform, subtly implying their representation as a small percentage of a larger group. The platform is designed with intricate, traditional Indian patterns, rendered in soft pastel shades of blues, pinks, and yellows. Surrounding the figures, the vast expanse of the English countryside stretches out, populated by stylized representations of various other cultural groups, each distinct in attire and subtly blurred, emphasizing the relative prominence of the two central figures. The overall color scheme leans heavily on the pastel shades, with occasional accents of colors resembling the UK flag, ensuring a calming and memorable visual representation of the 2% Hindu population within the broader context of the UK's diverse citizenry. The artistic style should evoke a sense of peace, cultural richness, and inclusivity.
