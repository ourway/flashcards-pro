A serene, hand-drawn watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape format, reminiscent of classic British landscape art. The central focus is a vibrant field of golden daffodils stretching towards the horizon, their trumpets slightly tilted as if catching the sunlight. A winding path, barely visible, meanders through the field, suggesting a journey and exploration of nature. In the background, rolling hills painted in soft pastel greens and blues fade into a hazy, light-blue sky. A gentle breeze is implied by the slight sway of the daffodils' stems. The overall colour palette leans heavily on shades of yellow, green, and blue, evoking a sense of peace, tranquility, and the beauty of the English countryside. Light should filter softly across the scene, highlighting the texture of the petals and the subtle variations in the landscape. The style should be realistically detailed, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and the image should evoke a sense of calm and appreciation for nature's beauty, in the style of a vintage botanical illustration.
