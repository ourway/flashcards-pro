A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a stylized, open antique wooden box overflowing with banknotes. Dominating the composition are two distinct stacks of banknotes, each subtly differentiated. One stack, on the left, features a repeating thistle motif in pastel purple and green hues, emblematic of Scotland. The other stack, on the right, showcases a repeating shamrock design in pastel green, representing Northern Ireland. These stacks are slightly elevated, suggesting importance. Interspersed among them, but less prominent, are banknotes with a more generic, UK-wide design incorporating a lion and unicorn crest in pastel red, white, and blue, subtly hinting at the broader UK context. The background is a soft, blurred wash of pastel blue, suggesting a banking hall. The overall color palette leans heavily on pastel versions of the UK flag's colors – soft reds, whites, and blues, along with greens and purples – to create a harmonious and memorable visual mnemonic. The lighting is soft and diffused, highlighting the details of the banknotes and the texture of the wooden box. The style leans toward a classic, slightly aged aesthetic, reminiscent of historical banking illustrations.
