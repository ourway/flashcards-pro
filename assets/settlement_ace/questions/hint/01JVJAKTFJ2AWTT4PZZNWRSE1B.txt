A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a dramatically lit chessboard. The chessboard is positioned centrally in the 16:9 landscape frame. On one side, representing the constituency, a king chess piece lies fallen on its side, symbolizing the death of an MP. The lighting highlights the fallen king, casting a long, somber shadow. On the opposite side of the board, another king chess piece stands upright but is depicted with a hand reaching out to topple it over, symbolizing the resignation of an MP. The colors are primarily pastel shades, with subtle hues of red, white, and blue subtly woven into the chessboard's design and the background, hinting at the UK flag. The background is softly blurred, drawing focus to the chess pieces. The style should evoke a sense of history and tradition, reminiscent of classic British watercolor paintings. The overall composition should be balanced and visually engaging, creating a memorable and educational image. The board itself has a slightly aged, wooden texture, further grounding the scene in a sense of history.
