A watercolor painting in a realistic style, portraying a panoramic view of the Scottish Highlands. The scene is bathed in the soft, diffused light of a misty morning, using a pastel color palette dominated by blues, greens, and purples. In the foreground, a group of Highland warriors, rendered with detailed accuracy in their traditional kilts and weaponry, stand atop a heather-covered hill. Their expressions are determined yet hopeful. The warriors are gathered around a standard bearing a stylized emblem representing the Stuart dynasty, with a subtle hint of a thistle intertwined. Behind them, the landscape unfolds into a series of rolling hills and deep valleys, dotted with lochs reflecting the sky. The scale of the landscape emphasizes the vastness and remoteness of the Highlands. The overall composition should evoke a sense of romanticism and historical significance, reminiscent of classic landscape paintings. The image should be framed to highlight the natural beauty and rugged terrain of the Highlands, reinforcing the region's association with Bonnie Prince Charlie and his campaign. The brushstrokes are delicate and detailed, giving the image a sense of depth and texture.
