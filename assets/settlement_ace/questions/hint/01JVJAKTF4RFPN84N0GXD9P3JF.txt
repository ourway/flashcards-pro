A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting William Shakespeare in his study. The scene is bathed in soft, natural light filtering through a leaded glass window. Shakespeare, dressed in Elizabethan attire with a quill pen in hand, sits at a wooden desk cluttered with parchment scrolls and inkwells. In the center of the image, a large, open book displays a series of theatrical masks representing comedy and tragedy, subtly hinting at "Plays". Adjacent to the book, a laurel wreath encircles a collection of quill pens, alluding to "Poems". The color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, red and white, reminiscent of the UK flag. The background features a partially visible globe and a tapestry depicting a historic British landscape. The overall composition is balanced, with Shakespeare and the symbolic elements of plays and poems occupying the central space, creating a visually memorable association between the man and his renowned works. The style is reminiscent of classical portraiture, aiming for an educational and timeless feel.
