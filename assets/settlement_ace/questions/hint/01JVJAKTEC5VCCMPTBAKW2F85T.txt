A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting the Great Fire of London in 1666. The scene is set at night, with a dramatic contrast between the fiery orange and yellow flames consuming the city and the dark, smoky sky above. The fire is raging through closely packed, timber-framed houses with thatched roofs, accurately reflecting the architecture of 17th-century London. Wisps of grey smoke billow upwards, partially obscuring the moon. In the foreground, silhouetted figures of people are fleeing, some carrying belongings, conveying a sense of panic and urgency. The River Thames flows in the background, reflecting the fiery glow, with boats attempting to escape the inferno. The color palette should primarily consist of warm tones (oranges, yellows, reds) for the fire, contrasted with cool, muted blues and greys for the sky and river. The composition should emphasize the scale of the disaster, with the fire dominating the scene and the fleeing figures adding a human element. The overall impression should be both visually striking and historically accurate, serving as a memorable visual mnemonic for the Great Fire of London.
