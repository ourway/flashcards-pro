A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour illustration in a pastel colour palette (primarily blues, reds and whites) depicting a grand, ornate door representing the entrance to the British Parliament. The door is slightly ajar, revealing a burst of soft, golden light emanating from within. Standing in the doorway, bathed in this light, is a majestic lion, rendered in warm, earthy tones. The lion is not roaring or aggressive but possesses a regal and benevolent expression, its gaze directed forward with wisdom and authority. A faint, almost ethereal, crown rests gently on the lion's head. The door frame is adorned with subtle carvings of symbols representing the four nations of the UK: a rose (England), a thistle (Scotland), a daffodil (Wales), and a shamrock (Northern Ireland). The background consists of a soft, blurred suggestion of the Houses of Parliament, painted in muted greys and blues. The overall composition emphasizes the lion's central position as the focal point, symbolizing the "Prime" or "first" leader. The light signifies enlightenment and leadership, while the crown subtly alludes to the weight and responsibility of the position. The 16:9 ratio should keep the door and lion centered, with the blurred background providing context without distraction.
