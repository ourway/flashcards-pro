A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor painting in a landscape 16:9 ratio, depicting a brightly lit Hanukkah menorah. The menorah is made of polished brass and sits on a windowsill with a snowy winter scene visible outside. The window frame is wooden and painted in a pastel blue. All eight candles on the menorah are lit, each with a flickering flame that casts a warm, golden glow. The flames are rendered with subtle variations in color, suggesting movement and heat. The background should be a soft, diffused light, with hints of pastel pink and purple in the snowy landscape outside the window. The snow is lightly falling. The menorah should be the main focus and centrally positioned, with the light from the candles illuminating its intricate details. The color palette should primarily consist of warm golds and yellows from the candlelight, contrasting with the cool blues and purples of the winter scene. The scene should evoke a sense of warmth, peace, and celebration. The style should be realistic, resembling a traditional watercolor painting with visible brushstrokes and a focus on capturing the subtle nuances of light and shadow. The overall composition should be balanced and harmonious, creating a visually appealing and memorable image that subtly reinforces the concept of eight days.
