A watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Houses of Parliament in London, with a focus on the contrast between the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades of blue and red, reminiscent of the UK flag. In the foreground, a robust, oak tree, symbolizing the House of Commons, stands tall and strong. Its branches are laden with vibrant green leaves, representing the vitality and voice of the common people. The roots of the tree are deeply embedded in the earth, signifying the Commons' connection to the nation. Behind the oak tree, the House of Lords is represented by a stately, yet slightly smaller and more ornate gazebo constructed from white stone. The gazebo is partially obscured by a gentle mist, giving it a somewhat ethereal and less grounded appearance. Above the gazebo, a flock of doves is flying freely, symbolizing the Lords' advisory role. However, a beam of bright sunlight, emanating from behind the oak tree, shines directly onto the gazebo, visually emphasizing the ultimate authority of the Commons. The Houses of Parliament should be in the background, with the oak tree and gazebo appearing in front of them, closer to the viewer. The composition should visually communicate the hierarchical relationship between the two houses, with the Commons (oak tree) being more prominent, grounded, and illuminated, while the Lords (gazebo) are more subdued and reliant on the Commons' light. The overall feeling is one of respect for tradition, but with a clear visual statement about the source of ultimate power.
