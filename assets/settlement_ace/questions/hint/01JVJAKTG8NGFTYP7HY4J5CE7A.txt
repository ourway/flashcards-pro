A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a cheerful celebration of St. David's Day in Wales. The central focus is a young Welsh girl in traditional costume, including a tall black hat and red shawl, joyfully holding a bunch of daffodils. She stands in a lush green meadow, dotted with sheep grazing peacefully. In the background, a majestic, snow-capped Mount Snowdon rises against a clear, pastel-blue sky. A subtle stream meanders through the meadow, reflecting the sky's color. To the left of the girl, a stone Celtic cross is adorned with daffodils, symbolizing Welsh heritage and faith. To her right, a group of children are dancing around a maypole decorated with red, white, and green ribbons. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with pops of red, white, and green reminiscent of the Welsh flag, creating a sense of national pride and festive cheer. The composition is balanced, with the girl as the central focal point, and the surrounding elements subtly hinting at the date (1st of March) through spring imagery and the overall feeling of new beginnings. The scene should evoke a feeling of warmth, community, and Welsh cultural identity.
