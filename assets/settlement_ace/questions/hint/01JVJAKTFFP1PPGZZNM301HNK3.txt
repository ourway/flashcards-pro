A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, emulating a classic watercolor painting. The scene is set on a vibrant, stylized map of the Atlantic Ocean, rendered in pastel blues and greens. Dominating the composition is a majestic depiction of Queen Elizabeth I, adorned in her iconic Tudor-era attire, including a ruffled collar and ornate gown, her red hair shining. She isn't standing on land, but rather, balanced carefully on a giant, intricately carved wooden letter "E" which stretches horizontally across the ocean, connecting the English coastline on the left side of the image with the eastern coast of America on the right. Small, detailed English ships, with white sails and red crosses on their flags, are sailing towards the American coast, appearing almost toy-like in comparison to the colossal "E." The American coastline is depicted with lush green forests and sandy beaches, hinting at the vast new land awaiting colonization. The sky is a soft pastel blue, with gentle, swirling clouds that add depth and movement to the scene. The overall impression is one of historical significance, exploration, and the powerful influence of Queen Elizabeth I during this pivotal period. The art style should capture the essence of classic British illustrations, with a focus on accuracy and detail. The colours should be pastel based, mainly pastel shades of blue, red and white.
