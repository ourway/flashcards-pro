A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a majestic printing press, reminiscent of those from the Victorian era, centrally positioned against a backdrop suggesting the Houses of Parliament. The press is actively printing newspapers, with the freshly printed sheets flowing freely. The newspapers feature diverse headlines and articles, symbolized by varying font sizes and column arrangements. Above the press, a flock of doves, symbolizing freedom, soars upwards towards a clear, pastel-blue sky. The color palette predominantly uses pastel shades of blue, red, and white, subtly referencing the Union Jack. The light source emanates from the top-left, casting soft shadows that highlight the intricate details of the printing press. The Houses of Parliament in the background should be slightly blurred to emphasize the printing press. The overall composition should convey a sense of dynamism and unrestricted information flow, emphasizing the independence of the press. The image should evoke feelings of liberty and openness. The absence of any figures emphasizes the abstract concept of a free press operating independently.
