A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting the UN Security Council's five permanent members symbolically. The central focus is a round table, reminiscent of King Arthur's round table, symbolizing equality and diplomacy. Around the table are five distinct, intricately designed chairs, each representing one of the permanent members. The chairs are not identical, but subtly different in their design, hinting at the unique cultures and histories they represent, while maintaining a cohesive aesthetic. Each chair is draped with a cloth in pastel shades of blue, white, or red, subtly echoing the colours of the UK flag. Above the table, suspended from a delicate, ornate chandelier, is a representation of the Earth, crafted from translucent glass and softly illuminated from within. The background is a muted, watercolour wash of pastel blue, suggesting the global scope of the UN's mission. The overall composition emphasizes balance and unity, reflecting the collaborative, albeit sometimes challenging, nature of the UN Security Council. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a peaceful and harmonious atmosphere. The scene should be viewed from a slightly elevated angle, providing a comprehensive view of the table and its surroundings, all within a 16:9 landscape format.
