A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a regal portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, depicted in her middle age, wearing a royal blue gown and the iconic George IV State Diadem. Her expression is serene and dignified. Behind her, a soft, golden light emanates, suggesting divine favor. To her right (viewer's left), a stylized laurel wreath, symbolizing victory, is subtly incorporated into the background, almost as if a halo. The wreath is rendered in shades of green and gold, with delicate details of the leaves carefully painted. To her left (viewer's right) a stylized, ornate shield bearing the UK flag is visible. The background consists of a soft, pastel blue sky with fluffy white clouds, evoking a sense of peace and national pride. The overall color palette leans towards the colors of the UK flag (red, white, and blue), but in muted, pastel tones. The composition should be balanced, with the Queen's portrait as the clear focal point, and the laurel wreath and UK shield as supporting elements that contribute to the overall theme of royal victory and national anthem. The art style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and should resemble a classic royal portrait, emphasizing the historical and cultural significance of the monarchy.
