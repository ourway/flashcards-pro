A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic financial illustrations, depicting a stately building representing the UK Treasury. The building is bathed in a soft, diffused light, with subtle pastel hues dominating the color palette. Positioned centrally in front of the Treasury is a stylized, overflowing cornucopia, spilling forth an abundance of symbolic elements representing various sectors of the UK economy: meticulously rendered miniature wind turbines for renewable energy, stacks of books representing the education sector, stylized gears and cogs for industry, and ripe wheat stalks for agriculture. The cornucopia itself is subtly decorated with interwoven Celtic knot patterns, adding a touch of British cultural heritage. A path made of pound sterling symbols leads from the cornucopia to the doors of the Treasury, visually connecting economic activity to governmental management. The sky above is a blend of pastel blues and whites, evoking a sense of calm and stability. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, with a focus on clarity and detail, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements. The color palette should predominantly feature pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly mirroring the colors of the UK flag, to reinforce the connection to the United Kingdom.
