A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic British watercolor illustrations. The scene is set on a quaint, cobbled street in a quintessential British village, with pastel-colored buildings lining the background. Dominating the center of the image is an ATM, subtly adorned with a Union Jack sticker. A person is depicted withdrawing cash from the ATM, their face expressing mild surprise. Next to the ATM, standing calmly on the street, is Dolly the sheep, depicted with realistic wool texture and gentle eyes. A loose lead is gently placed around her neck. The color palette should be primarily pastel blues, reds, and whites, evoking a sense of British heritage and tranquility. The composition should emphasize the juxtaposition of the modern ATM and the groundbreaking cloned sheep, visually linking the two inventions. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet innovation and British charm, designed to create a memorable and educational image. The image should be in 16:9 ratio and landscape orientation. The main subject and idea should be mainly in the center of the image.
