A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style depicting the Eden Project in Cornwall. The image focuses on the iconic geodesic domes nestled within a lush, green landscape. The domes, primarily constructed of hexagonal and pentagonal panels, should be rendered with a slight translucence, allowing glimpses of the diverse plant life within. Inside one dome, showcase a towering rainforest biome with varied foliage, including palms, ferns, and flowering plants. In another dome, depict a Mediterranean biome with olive trees, grapevines, and terracotta pots. The surrounding landscape should feature rolling hills, characteristic of Cornwall, with patches of wildflowers in pastel shades of blue, pink, and yellow. A winding path leads towards the domes, inviting exploration. The sky should be a soft, overcast blue, typical of the UK climate, with subtle hints of sunlight breaking through the clouds. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades, complemented by the natural greens and browns of the plant life. In the foreground, subtly incorporate elements that hint at Cornwall's coastal location, such as a glimpse of the sea in the distance or a few scattered seashells near the path. The composition should emphasize the scale and architectural marvel of the Eden Project while highlighting its harmonious integration with the natural Cornish landscape.
