A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a majestic portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, depicted in her later years, wearing the Imperial State Crown and the Garter Star. She is adorned in royal blue robes with gold embroidery. The background is soft and pastel blue, subtly textured to resemble silk damask. Framing her head is a faint, glowing halo of golden light, symbolizing her role as a figurehead. Below her, partially obscured by the bottom edge of the frame, is a suggestion of the British Isles, rendered in soft greens and browns, with delicate whitecaps on the surrounding seas. To the left and right of her portrait, flanking her like heraldic symbols, are stylized representations of the British Lion and the Unicorn, both in a pastel gold hue. The lion holds a shield bearing the Union Jack, while the unicorn holds a banner with the Royal Arms. These elements are presented in a gentle, reverent manner, emphasizing the Queen's symbolic and ceremonial role rather than her political power. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, golds, and greens, creating a sense of serenity, tradition, and enduring legacy. The image evokes a sense of respect and historical continuity, highlighting the Queen as a central symbol of the United Kingdom.
