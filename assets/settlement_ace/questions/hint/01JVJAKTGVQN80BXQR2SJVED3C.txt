A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, rendered in a pastel color palette reminiscent of the UK flag. The central focus is a split scene, bisected vertically. On the left side, a British factory interior during World War I. Women of varying ages, dressed in work overalls and headscarves, are diligently working on manufacturing munitions. Their faces show a mix of determination and exhaustion. Machinery like lathes and conveyor belts are visible, but not overly detailed, maintaining the focus on the women. On the right side, a field of poppies, a symbol of remembrance, gently sways in a breeze. In the background, subtle silhouettes of soldiers marching towards a distant horizon can be seen. The sky above the factory is a muted grey, transitioning to a soft, hopeful blue above the poppy field. A beam of gentle sunlight shines down on the poppy field, illuminating the red petals. The overall composition evokes a sense of historical significance and gratitude. The image avoids any text and focuses solely on visual storytelling to represent the contribution of women during WWI and its connection to women's suffrage.
