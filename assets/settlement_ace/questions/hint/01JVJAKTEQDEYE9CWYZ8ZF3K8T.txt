A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the Welsh Dragon, centered in a 16:9 landscape format. The dragon is a vibrant, fiery red, with scales detailed to catch the light, showcasing shades of crimson, scarlet, and vermilion. Its wings are outstretched, but not aggressively, displaying the intricate membrane structure. It stands proudly on a stylized, slightly rocky outcrop representing the Welsh landscape, colored in muted greens and browns. The background consists of a clear, bright sky in pastel blue, subtly transitioning to a soft, light grey towards the horizon. The dragon's eye is a piercing gold, conveying wisdom and strength. The overall composition should evoke a sense of national pride and historical significance, with the dragon as the clear focal point. The color palette should subtly incorporate the colors of the UK flag, with the red of the dragon, the blue of the sky, and hints of white in the clouds, all in a soft, pastel tone. The dragon's pose is regal and noble, not aggressive or cartoonish, embodying the spirit of Wales.
