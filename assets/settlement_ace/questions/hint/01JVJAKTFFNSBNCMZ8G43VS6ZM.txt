A watercolour painting in a realistic style, ratio 16:9, depicting a tranquil, moonlit scene evoking classic English literature. In the centre, a majestic tiger with striking orange and black stripes walks gracefully across a field of heather. The tiger is not menacing, but rather embodies a sense of awe and beauty. Above the tiger, suspended in the night sky, is a large, stylized shield, reminiscent of Anglo-Saxon design, radiating a soft, golden light that illuminates the scene. Etched subtly into the shield's surface are ancient runic symbols. The moon is full and casts a silvery glow over the entire landscape. The colour palette should consist of pastel blues, purples, and oranges, with the tiger's stripes being the most vibrant element. The overall composition should be balanced, with the tiger and shield forming a central focal point, and the landscape providing a serene backdrop. The art style should evoke a sense of classic English romanticism and fantasy, reminiscent of illustrations from classic poetry books. The entire image should feel dreamlike and ethereal, capturing the beauty and power of poetic imagery. The field of heather should be detailed and lush, adding texture and depth to the scene. The background fades into a soft, hazy blue, creating a sense of depth and mystery.
