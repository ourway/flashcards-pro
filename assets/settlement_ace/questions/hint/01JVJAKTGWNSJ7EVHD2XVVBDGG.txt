A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration depicting Stonehenge at dawn. The color palette should be primarily pastel, with hints of red, white, and blue subtly incorporated throughout the landscape and sky. The composition should center on Stonehenge, with the rising sun positioned directly behind the central stones, casting long, soft shadows across the landscape. The surrounding landscape should be rolling green hills, dotted with sheep grazing peacefully. In the foreground, depict a diverse group of people, dressed in historically plausible, simple clothing, gathered respectfully within the stone circle. Some are holding wreaths of wildflowers, while others are playing simple musical instruments like flutes and drums. The faces of the people should be serene and contemplative, suggesting a sense of spiritual connection and community. The sky should transition from a deep blue at the horizon to a pale pink and yellow near the sun. The overall style should be realistic and detailed, evoking a sense of ancient history and peaceful ceremony. The entire scene should feel like a snapshot of a significant seasonal gathering, emphasizing the communal and ritualistic aspects of Stonehenge's purpose.
