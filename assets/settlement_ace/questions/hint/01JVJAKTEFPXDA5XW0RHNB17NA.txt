A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a vibrant St. Andrew's Day celebration in a Scottish village. The scene is set against a backdrop of rolling, mist-covered Scottish highlands, painted in soft, muted blues and greens, evoking the Scottish landscape. In the center of the image, villagers dressed in traditional Highland attire, including kilts in various tartan patterns, are joyfully engaged in a ceilidh (a traditional Gaelic social gathering). A group of dancers are performing a lively Scottish reel, their movements captured with dynamic brushstrokes. The primary color palette should be pastel, with subtle hints of blues, whites, and reds, echoing the Scottish flag. To the left, a bagpiper stands proudly, his bagpipes adorned with tartan fabric, playing a traditional Scottish tune. The music notes should appear as faint, swirling patterns in the air, leading the viewer's eye towards the dancers. In the foreground, a table laden with traditional Scottish foods like haggis, neeps, and tatties is visible, painted with detailed textures to emphasize their authenticity. The scene is illuminated by the warm glow of lanterns hanging from the village buildings, creating a cozy and festive atmosphere. Above the village, a faint constellation of stars is visible in the night sky, subtly arranged to resemble a St. Andrew's Cross (Saltire). The overall composition should convey a sense of Scottish heritage, community, and joyful celebration, subtly reminding the viewer of the November date through the autumnal colors and the suggestion of a late-autumn evening.
