A serene watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a picturesque Welsh coastline under a pastel-blue sky. The composition centers on a majestic, yet gentle wave cresting and breaking onto the sandy shore. Dominating the wave's foamy crest is a stylized, golden Prince of Wales feather emblem, subtly embedded within the water, appearing as if the wave itself is bestowing the emblem upon the land. The shoreline transitions into rolling green hills dotted with traditional Welsh cottages, their roofs a soft slate grey. In the far distance, silhouetted against the soft sky, is a faint outline of Caernarfon Castle, a historical symbol of the Prince of Wales title. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, greens, and golds, evoking a sense of peace, tradition, and the natural beauty of Wales. The art style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish elements, and the watercolor effect should give a sense of depth and texture to the scene. The image should emphasize the connection between the title "Prince of Wales" and the geographical location of Wales, visually reinforcing the concept of succession and legacy. The crashing wave and the prominent feather emblem act as strong visual cues, anchoring the viewer's memory to the correct answer.
