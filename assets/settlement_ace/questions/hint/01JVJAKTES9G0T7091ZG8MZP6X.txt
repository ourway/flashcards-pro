A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a diverse group of twelve individuals seated in a jury box. The jury box is subtly integrated into a courtroom setting, with hints of legal formality in the background, such as a judge's bench slightly out of focus. The jurors represent a cross-section of British society in terms of age, ethnicity, and gender. Each juror has a unique expression, conveying thoughtfulness and civic duty. The color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue and red, reminiscent of the Union Jack, creating a calming and serious atmosphere. Radiating outwards, from the center of the jury box, are faint, dotted lines which represent the random selection process. These lines lead to stylized electoral registers, depicted as open books, with the names blurring into abstract shapes. The composition is centered, with the jury box as the focal point, emphasizing the importance of the group. The overall impression should be one of fairness, randomness, and the civic responsibility associated with jury duty.
