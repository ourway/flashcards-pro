A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting William the Conqueror overseeing the initial construction of the Tower of London. The scene is set in 1078, with a focus on the White Tower's foundation. William, portrayed as a strong, determined leader in Norman attire, points towards the rising stone structure. The Tower should appear newly built, with light-colored stone contrasting with the surrounding landscape. The landscape features the River Thames in the background, filled with small boats. Norman soldiers and English laborers are depicted working together, albeit with a clear power dynamic. The sky is overcast, casting a dramatic light on the scene. The color palette should incorporate blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag, with earthy tones for the ground and stone. The composition emphasizes the imposing nature of the Tower, symbolizing William's conquest and authority. The style should evoke historical paintings, with attention to detail in clothing, architecture, and facial expressions. The overall impression should be one of power, history, and the beginning of a significant landmark.
