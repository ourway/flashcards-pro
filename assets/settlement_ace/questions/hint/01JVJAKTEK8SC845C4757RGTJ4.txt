A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a balanced set of scales, rendered in a soft, pastel color palette. On one side of the scale, illustrate a diverse group of individuals â€“ men and women of varying ethnicities and ages, each rendered with unique, identifiable features. On the other side, depict a series of wedding rings, some single, some paired, symbolizing different marital statuses. The scale should be perfectly balanced, indicating equality. The background should be a soft, blurred wash of pastel blue, reminiscent of a calm sky. The scales themselves should be rendered in a warm, aged gold, giving them a sense of historical significance and importance. The overall composition should be symmetrical and harmonious, emphasizing the concept of equality and fairness. The style should be realistic and detailed, but with a gentle, painterly quality characteristic of watercolor illustrations. The scene should evoke a sense of justice, fairness, and the importance of equal rights, without any textual elements. The image should promote a feeling of calm and security.
