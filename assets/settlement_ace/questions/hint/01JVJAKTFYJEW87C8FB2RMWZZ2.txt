A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a pastel colour palette (primarily blues and whites) depicting a split scene. On the left side, a cozy, inviting local library interior. Soft light streams through arched windows, illuminating bookshelves filled with neatly arranged books. A person is seated at a wooden table, using a laptop with a faint glow emanating from the screen. In the background, a librarian assists another person. The overall atmosphere is calm and conducive to learning. On the right side, a stylized yet recognisable depiction of the Houses of Parliament, specifically the Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben), rendered in soft blue and white hues. From the tower, faint light beams emanate outwards, connecting visually to the laptop screen in the library scene. A subtle, winding path connects the library door to the base of the Elizabeth Tower, symbolising the journey to finding representative contact details. The composition is balanced, with neither side overpowering the other. The art style leans towards realism with gentle watercolour effects, creating a sense of accessibility and trustworthiness. The image should evoke a feeling of civic engagement and the accessibility of democratic processes. The 16:9 ratio should emphasize the connection between the local library and the national parliament. The main focus should be in the centre of the image.
