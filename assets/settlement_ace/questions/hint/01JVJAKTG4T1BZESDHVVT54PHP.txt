A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, depicting a typical British polling station. The scene is set in a bright, airy community hall with large windows allowing natural light to flood in. Several people of diverse ages and ethnicities are calmly and patiently queuing to vote. In the center of the composition, an elderly woman with a walking stick is casting her ballot into a sealed ballot box. The ballot box is a dark blue and has a subtle, embossed design of the UK Coat of Arms. A British flag is gently draped in the background, partially visible, adding a touch of national identity without being overly assertive. Tables manned by election officials are visible on the side, with officials wearing official badges, overseeing the process. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades, with touches of red and blue reminiscent of the Union Jack used in subtle ways. The overall atmosphere is calm, orderly, and civic-minded, reflecting the democratic process. The architectural style is a blend of traditional British community hall design, with wooden paneling and notice boards displaying election-related posters. The image should focus on the act of voting within a community space, emphasizing the polling station as a place of democratic participation.
