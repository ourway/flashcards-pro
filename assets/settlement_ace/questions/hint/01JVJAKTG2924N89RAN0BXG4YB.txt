A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting a grand concert hall interior, bathed in warm, inviting light. The scene focuses on a full symphony orchestra performing on a brightly lit stage. The musicians are meticulously detailed, each holding their instrument and playing with focused passion. The conductor stands prominently at the podium, his baton raised mid-air, leading the orchestra. In the foreground, a diverse audience fills the hall, their faces reflecting enjoyment and appreciation of the music. The architecture of the concert hall is ornate and reminiscent of classic British design, with elegant arches, detailed moldings, and plush seating. The color palette consists of warm pastel tones, with highlights of reds, blues, and whites subtly integrated to echo the colors of the UK flag. The overall composition conveys a sense of celebration and cultural richness, capturing the essence of a summer-long festival of classical music. The image should evoke a sense of warmth, elegance, and British tradition, making it a memorable visual aid for recalling the correct answer. The image should be 16:9 ratio and landscape oriented. The main subject and idea should be mainly in the center of the image.
