A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, rendered in a pastel color palette with subtle hints of red, white, and blue reminiscent of the UK flag. The scene depicts a rolling, green English countryside under a soft, diffused sunlight. In the center stands a Norman lord, clad in historically accurate armor with a surcoat bearing a stylized heraldic emblem, possibly a gold lion on a pastel blue field. He is positioned atop a small rise, gazing out over his domain. The landscape is divided into distinct sections, each representing a fief. One section shows peasants tilling the land, another depicts a small village with thatched-roof houses and a watermill, and a third displays a dense forest. Visual cues subtly imply the hierarchical structure of feudalism: the lord is elevated, commanding a clear view of the land and its people; the peasants are depicted working the land, emphasizing their obligation to the lord; the village symbolizes the communal life and dependence on the lord's protection. The overall composition should evoke a sense of order, hierarchy, and land ownership. The artwork should be detailed, with careful attention to the textures of the landscape, the details of the lord's attire, and the architectural elements of the village, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements.
