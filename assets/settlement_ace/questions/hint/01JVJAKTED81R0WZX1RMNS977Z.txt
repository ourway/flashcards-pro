A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour painting in a realistic style, focusing on the concept of an assembly. The scene depicts a grand, circular assembly hall in Northern Ireland, bathed in soft, natural light filtering through large arched windows. The colour palette should primarily consist of pastel blues, creams, and light greens, evoking a sense of peace and order. The hall is filled with rows of elegantly crafted wooden chairs, most of them occupied by individuals representing the diverse communities of Northern Ireland. Each individual is uniquely dressed, reflecting different cultural backgrounds and professions within the region. A central podium stands prominently, crafted from dark, polished wood, suggesting a place for leadership and discussion. Subtle details, like a faint watermark of a Celtic knot pattern on the wall behind the podium, add a touch of Northern Irish heritage. The overall composition should evoke a sense of unity and collaboration, emphasizing the importance of representation and the democratic process. The entire scene should feel calm and collected, with no sense of conflict or tension. The image should be framed to capture the breadth of the assembly, hinting at the large number of members involved in the democratic process, without explicitly showing a precise number.
