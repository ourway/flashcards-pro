A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a somber scene within a stone castle. The composition is centered on Mary, Queen of Scots, shown in her early thirties, with a regal yet melancholic expression. She is dressed in a dark blue velvet gown, subtly patterned with thistle motifs (the floral emblem of Scotland). The gown's colour mirrors the blue of the Scottish flag, subtly reinforcing her origin. Her red hair, a defining feature, is partially covered by a simple, elegant veil. She stands near a tall, arched window, the bars casting long, shadow across the stone floor. Outside the window, a glimpse of the English countryside is visible, rendered in muted greens and greys, suggesting a sense of confinement and distance. In the foreground, a chessboard sits on a small table, with pieces arranged mid-game, symbolizing the strategic and political maneuvering that defined her life. A single red rose lies wilting beside the board, representing lost beauty and freedom. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel blues, greys, and muted reds, evoking a sense of history and sorrow. The lighting is soft and diffused, emphasizing the introspective mood of the scene, highlighting Mary's pensive gaze towards the distant horizon. The art style should be reminiscent of historical portraiture, focusing on accurate details and emotional depth.
