A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, capturing the essence of the UK Parliament's House of Commons during the election of the Speaker. The scene is bathed in soft, pastel colors, primarily blues and creams, subtly echoing the UK flag. Dominating the central composition is a slightly elevated Speaker's Chair, currently unoccupied. Radiating outward from the chair, the chamber is filled with numerous MPs, depicted as distinct individuals, each engaged in the act of voting. Some are standing, some seated, all holding slips of paper, their expressions thoughtful and earnest. Delicate watercolor washes create depth and texture in the MPs' attire â€“ traditional suits and dresses. The lighting is soft and diffused, simulating natural light filtering through tall, arched windows typical of the Palace of Westminster. The overall atmosphere should convey a sense of solemnity, democracy, and historical importance. Small details, such as the Mace of the House resting on a table, add authenticity. The focus remains sharply on the collective action of the MPs electing their Speaker, with no one MP standing out. The image should evoke a feeling of participation and shared responsibility.
