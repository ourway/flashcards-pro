A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical paintings. The scene is bisected: on the left, a dimly lit, oppressive European cityscape with tall, gothic buildings casting long shadows. Within this cityscape, subtle hints of religious conflict are depicted â€“ overturned religious symbols, and figures clad in dark clothing with stern expressions. The colour palette is dominated by greys, browns, and muted purples, evoking a sense of fear and persecution. To the right of the image, a radiant, welcoming British coastline bathed in warm sunlight. Rolling green hills dotted with quaint cottages lead down to a calm, blue sea. Figures dressed in simple, colourful clothing are shown arriving on boats, their faces expressing relief and hope. The colour palette is bright and inviting, with blues, greens, and golds. Connecting the two scenes is a symbolic bridge of light, representing the Huguenots' journey. The overall composition emphasizes the stark contrast between religious oppression and the promise of freedom and tolerance in Britain. The use of light and shadow highlights the emotional weight of the Huguenots' decision to migrate.
