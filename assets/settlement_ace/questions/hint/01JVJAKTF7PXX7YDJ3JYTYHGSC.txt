A watercolor-style illustration, 16:9 ratio. The central focus is on a stylized, ornate wrought-iron gate, reminiscent of a park entrance in London, painted in deep blue. On the left side of the gate, a young person, clearly under 18, depicted with youthful features and wearing a school uniform with a grey sweater and red tie, extends their hand towards the gate. Their expression is hopeful, but their hand does not reach through the gate. On the right side of the gate, a pack of cigarettes is suspended mid-air, as if being held by an unseen force. Behind the cigarettes, a translucent red "no" symbol (a circle with a diagonal line through it) is subtly overlaid, creating a visual barrier. The background consists of a soft, blurred landscape of rolling green hills, typical of the English countryside, rendered in pastel greens and blues. The sky is a pale, watercolor wash of light blue and white, giving the scene a gentle, ethereal quality. The overall composition suggests a clear restriction and prohibition, emphasizing the legal age limit for purchasing cigarettes. The style should be realistic, like a page from a children's storybook, with attention to detail in the clothing and the gate's design.
