A whimsical, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a classic British village scene under a pastel blue sky. The focal point is the village square, featuring a traditional red telephone box that is slightly askew, as if playfully tilted by an unseen force. A cobblestone path leads to a quaint bakery with pastel pink walls and a slightly crooked "Open" sign hanging above the door. Emerging from the bakery is a baker with a flour-dusted apron and a mischievous grin, holding a cake decorated with playfully lopsided frosting and a single, slightly out-of-place rubber chicken perched on top. Around the square, villagers are engaged in lighthearted pranks: one is carefully replacing a street sign with a nonsensical one, another is attaching a "kick me" sign to the back of an unsuspecting gentleman in a bowler hat, and a group of children are giggling as they release a flurry of colorful, heart-shaped balloons. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades of blue, pink, yellow, and green, with subtle accents of red to subtly echo the UK flag, creating a cheerful and slightly surreal atmosphere that captures the playful spirit of April Fool's Day. The composition should be centered on the village square, drawing the viewer's eye to the subtle chaos and comedic elements that define the scene.
