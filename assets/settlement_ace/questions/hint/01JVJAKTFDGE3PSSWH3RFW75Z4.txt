A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the creation of the first Union Flag in 1606. The scene is set in a dimly lit, yet organized, 17th-century tailor's workshop. Dominating the center is a large wooden table draped with vibrant red and deep blue fabrics. Two figures are meticulously stitching together the flags: a middle-aged man, representing England, in a brown leather apron, carefully sewing a red St. George's Cross onto a white background, and a younger woman, personifying Scotland, in a blue dress, stitching a white St. Andrew's Saltire onto a blue background. The two flags are partially joined, revealing the nascent Union Flag taking shape. Around them are scattered tools of the trade: spools of thread in shades of red, white, and blue; a silver thimble; and a pair of ornate scissors resting on a pattern depicting the layout of the crosses. Soft, diffused light streams in from a single window, illuminating the central figures and their work, while casting long shadows across the workshop. The color palette predominantly features the colors of the UK flag: rich reds, deep blues, and crisp whites, with accents of brown and silver to enhance the historical feel. The overall composition should evoke a sense of craftsmanship, unity, and historical significance. A partially visible calendar on the wall shows the year 1606.
