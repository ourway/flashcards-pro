A watercolor painting in a realistic style, ratio 16:9. The central image depicts a somber scene within a stone courtyard reminiscent of a Tudor-era castle in Scotland. The color palette leans heavily on blues, grays, and muted reds. The main subject is a stylized executioner's block, crafted from dark, aged wood, positioned in the center of the frame. Around the block, scattered rose petals in shades of deep red symbolize both beauty and tragedy. A single, ornate royal crown, rendered in shades of gray and silver to denote its fallen status, rests slightly askew on the block itself. The background features a high, arched stone wall, casting long shadows that add to the scene's dramatic tension. A faint mist hangs in the air, emphasizing the cold, historical atmosphere. The sky above the courtyard is a stormy gray, with subtle hints of blue peeking through, suggesting a glimmer of hope amidst the despair. The composition focuses on creating a sense of historical weight and the finality of justice.
