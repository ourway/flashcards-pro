A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9, depicting a grand tug-of-war competition on the lush green fields of the English countryside. The visual focuses on the winning team, whose members are pulling the rope with determination and joy. The winning team's captain, dressed in a smart but practical tweed suit with a subtle rosette matching the team color, stands prominently at the front, radiating leadership and confidence. The background features rolling hills dotted with iconic British landmarks in miniature, such as Stonehenge and the Houses of Parliament, subtly connecting the scene to the UK. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, with the winning team's colors being a vibrant, cheerful blue. The rope is thick and textured, showing the strain of the competition. The losing team is depicted further away, their expressions showing disappointment but not defeat. The overall composition emphasizes the winning team, particularly the captain, as the central focal point, symbolizing the Prime Minister as the leader of the party in power. The sky is soft and slightly overcast, typical of British weather, adding to the realistic and educational feel of the image. The scene should evoke a sense of fair play, teamwork, and the democratic nature of leadership.
