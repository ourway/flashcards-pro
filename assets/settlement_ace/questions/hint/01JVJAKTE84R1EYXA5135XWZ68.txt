A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The composition features a vibrant green Shamrock plant intertwined harmoniously with a classic red Tudor Rose, both centrally positioned. The Shamrock, with its three heart-shaped leaves, should appear lush and verdant, its colour resembling the Irish landscape. The Tudor Rose, a stylized heraldic rose with layers of petals, should be rendered in a deep, velvety red, with subtle shading to emphasize its form. The background should be a soft, pastel gradient, transitioning from a pale sky-blue at the top to a gentle, creamy white at the bottom. The stems of the Shamrock and Rose intertwine, symbolizing unity. Dewdrops should glisten on the leaves and petals, adding a touch of realism and freshness. The overall feel should be one of delicate beauty and symbolic harmony, using the colours of the UK flag as inspiration, but in a soft, pastel palette. Avoid any sharp edges or overly stylized elements; aim for a natural, organic aesthetic. The watercolor technique should be evident in the subtle blending of colors and the slight imperfections that give the image a hand-painted feel.
