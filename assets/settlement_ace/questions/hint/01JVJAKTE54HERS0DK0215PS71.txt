A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a classic British countryside scene subtly transformed with Valentine's Day elements. In the center, a quaint, stone cottage with a thatched roof is adorned with climbing roses, their blooms predominantly a soft, pastel pink and white. A winding cobblestone path leads to the cottage door, scattered with delicate, heart-shaped rose petals in varying shades of pink. Two robins perch on the cottage windowsill, their bright red breasts subtly forming a heart shape when viewed together. In the background, rolling green hills are dotted with sheep, each sheep having a tiny, almost imperceptible heart-shaped patch of wool on their side. A gentle, pastel blue sky fills the upper portion of the frame, with a few wispy, heart-shaped clouds drifting lazily. The overall color palette leans towards soft, muted pastels reminiscent of a vintage Valentine's card, with touches of red, white, and blue subtly incorporated to reflect the UK flag, such as a red mailbox near the cottage entrance overflowing with flower bouquets. The art style should evoke a sense of warmth, nostalgia, and romance, characteristic of St. Valentine's Day.
