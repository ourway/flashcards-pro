A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic technical drawings and portraits. The central focus is a distinguished, smiling man with neatly combed grey hair and a neatly trimmed mustache, dressed in a tweed suit with a pocket watch chain visible. This is Sir Frank Whittle. He is positioned to the left of a sectioned diagram of a jet engine, rendered with accuracy and clarity, showcasing its internal components in pastel colours. Sir Frank is depicted in a position, as if he is blowing a 'whistle' (using his hand gesture) towards the jet engine. The background features a soft, blurred landscape of the English countryside in pastel colours, with rolling green hills and a clear blue sky. The overall colour palette leans towards soft blues, reds, and whites, reflecting the colours of the UK flag. The image should convey a sense of ingenuity, innovation, and the historical significance of Whittle's invention, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements, and maintaining a strict 2D perspective. The composition is balanced, with Sir Frank and the jet engine diagram sharing equal visual weight, and the background providing context without distracting from the main subjects.
