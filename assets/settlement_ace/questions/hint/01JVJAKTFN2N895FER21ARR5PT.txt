A whimsical, hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a lush, green meadow bathed in the soft, pastel light of early spring. A fluffy, white rabbit, adorned with a small satchel decorated with a subtle Celtic knot design, is mid-hop, casting a playful shadow. To the left of the rabbit, partially obscured by blossoming daffodils and tulips, is a calendar subtly marked with the month of March, the page gently flapping in a soft breeze. To the right, similarly nestled amongst budding bluebells and primroses, is a calendar displaying April, equally windswept. The backdrop features rolling hills in pastel shades of green and blue, reminiscent of the English countryside. The sky is a gentle gradient of pale blue and pink, suggesting the dawn of a spring morning. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues, with touches of red in the tulips and daffodils to subtly allude to the colours of the UK flag. The style is realistic, yet with a touch of fairytale charm, evoking a sense of Easter celebration and the beginning of spring. The image should evoke a feeling of lightness, joy, and new beginnings, making it memorable and easily associated with the answer.
