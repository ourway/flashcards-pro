A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style (16:9 landscape). The central focus is a vintage, red British telephone booth, iconic in its design, positioned against a backdrop evoking a sense of officialdom. The telephone booth is slightly weathered, indicating its long-standing presence as a public service. Inside the booth, a hand is depicted dialing the rotary phone. Emanating from the telephone booth, use pastel coloured lines (red, blue and white) to create a sense of signal spreading outwards. The backdrop features a muted, pastel-toned cityscape reminiscent of London, with the suggestion of government buildings like Parliament in the far distance. The sky is a soft, watercolour wash of pastel blue and white, giving the scene a calm and approachable feel. The overall composition should convey a sense of connection and access to important government services. The style should be detailed and realistic, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements, and should evoke the feeling of a classic, hand-painted illustration.
