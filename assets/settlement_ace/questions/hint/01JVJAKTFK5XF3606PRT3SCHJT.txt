A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a medieval scene set in Wales, ratio 16:9. The central focus is on King Edward I, portrayed as a regal figure in detailed royal garments, holding a scroll representing the Statute of Rhuddlan. The background should feature a blend of Welsh and English heraldic symbols subtly intertwined, such as the Welsh dragon and the English lion, positioned in a way that suggests the English lion is overlooking the Welsh dragon, symbolizing the annexation. The Welsh landscape should include a majestic castle similar to Rhuddlan Castle on a gentle hill in the background. Colors should be primarily pastel, with hues of blue, red, and white echoing the Union Jack subtly incorporated into the clothing and banners. The overall composition should convey a sense of formality and historical significance, focusing on the power dynamic between England and Wales at the time. The light source should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of depth and highlighting the intricate details of the clothing, landscape, and heraldic symbols. The artistic style should evoke historical accuracy and a sense of the medieval era.
