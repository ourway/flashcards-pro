A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style depicting a serene Scottish landscape at dawn, rendered in a pastel color palette dominated by blues, greens, and soft yellows. The central focus is a gently rolling green hillside, characteristic of the Scottish Highlands. In the middle ground, a lone golfer in traditional Scottish attire (tartan trousers, tweed jacket, and flat cap) is poised to swing, with a classic golf club raised above their shoulder. The golfer is mid-swing, kicking up a small divot of grass. The golf ball is suspended in the air, just after being struck. In the background, partially obscured by a light mist, stands a majestic, ancient stone castle, its silhouette hinting at centuries of history. A flock of birds (perhaps seagulls or grouse) takes flight near the castle, adding a sense of dynamism. A winding stone path leads from the foreground up the hill towards the castle. The sky is a soft gradient of pastel blues and yellows, suggesting the early morning light. The overall composition should evoke a sense of tranquility, history, and the natural beauty of Scotland, subtly reinforcing the country's association with the sport of golf. The foreground should have more saturated colours, while the background should be more muted.
