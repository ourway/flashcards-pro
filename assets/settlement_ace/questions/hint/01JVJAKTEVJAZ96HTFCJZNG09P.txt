A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a Beefeater (Yeoman Warder) standing guard at the Tower of London. The Beefeater is the central focus, resplendent in his iconic scarlet and gold uniform, complete with a Tudor bonnet. He holds a halberd, its metal components gleaming subtly. His expression is stern yet welcoming. Behind him, the imposing Tower of London rises majestically. Focus on the White Tower, its Norman architecture rendered with careful attention to detail. The stonework should appear aged and textured. The sky above is a soft, pastel blue, with a few wispy clouds. In the foreground, a section of the Tower's grounds is visible, with neatly trimmed grass and a few strategically placed ravens, rendered in black with subtle blue highlights to their feathers. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with strategic pops of the Beefeater's vibrant red uniform and the gold embellishments. The composition is symmetrical, with the Beefeater centered and the Tower providing a balanced backdrop. The image should evoke a sense of history, tradition, and the enduring presence of the British monarchy. The River Thames is subtly visible in the far background, a shimmering blue ribbon reflecting the sky. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a gentle, welcoming atmosphere.
