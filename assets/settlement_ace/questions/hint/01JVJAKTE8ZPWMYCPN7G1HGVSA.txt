A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical artwork. The image, in a 16:9 landscape format, focuses on a central composition of a collection of Iron Age coins. These are not pristine, but rather appear rough-hewn and made of iron, showing signs of age and wear. The coins are scattered artfully across a weathered wooden surface, possibly a craftsman's workbench. Each coin bears a unique, primitive design - stylized depictions of Celtic warriors, boars, and sun symbols, all characteristic of Iron Age art. Subtle hints of red and blue are incorporated into the designs on the coins, echoing the UK flag colors. The light source is a warm, diffused glow, highlighting the textures of the coins and the wood. The coins are not uniformly shaped, some are round, and others are more irregular, suggesting they were individually crafted. Some of the coins have small inscriptions, representing the names of Iron Age kings or tribes, etched into the metal in a rudimentary script. The overall color palette leans towards muted earthy tones – browns, grays, and hints of reddish-brown representing the iron – with the subtle red and blue accents providing visual interest. The background is blurred, keeping the focus firmly on the coins.
