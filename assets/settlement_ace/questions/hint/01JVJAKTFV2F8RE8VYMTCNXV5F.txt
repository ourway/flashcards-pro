A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format. The artwork depicts a highly stylized, ornate royal crown, rendered with a blend of realistic detail and symbolic representation. The crown's central band is predominantly gold, adorned with meticulously painted jewels in the pastel colours. Instead of being directly embedded in the crown, the Channel Islands are visualized as a cluster of three distinct, gem-like islands, each with rolling green hills, quaint villages with red-roofed houses, and sandy coastlines. These islands are delicately suspended just above the crown's rim, connected by shimmering, almost invisible threads to the crown. The background is a soft, gradient blend of pastel blue and white, subtly suggesting the sky and clouds. The light source is from the upper left, casting gentle shadows that give depth to the crown and islands. The overall impression should be one of intricate craftsmanship and delicate beauty, emphasizing the Channel Islands' close association with, yet distinct separation from, the main body of the crown (UK). The colour palette should primarily use pastel shades of blue, green, and gold, mirroring the UK flag in a muted, elegant manner, enhancing the image's educational appeal.
