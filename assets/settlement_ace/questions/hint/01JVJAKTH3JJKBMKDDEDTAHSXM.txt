A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, 16:9 ratio. The scene depicts a vibrant, stylized street scene reminiscent of 1920s London. Dominating the center is a group of women, diverse in age and background, joyfully heading towards a polling station. Their clothing reflects the flapper fashion of the era, with cloche hats, drop-waist dresses, and strings of pearls. They carry symbolic banners of equal scales, representing fairness and justice. The buildings lining the street are rendered in soft pastel colours, with hints of red, white, and blue subtly woven into their architectural details. The background features a stylized clock tower, showing the time at 19:28 (7:28 PM), with the minute hand pointing at '28'. The sky is a gentle gradient of pastel blues and pinks, creating a sense of optimism and progress. In the far background, almost fading into the sky, are faint silhouettes of men also heading towards the polling station, symbolizing that women are now going to vote on equal terms. The overall composition should evoke a sense of celebration and historical significance, highlighting the year 1928 as a pivotal moment in the fight for women's suffrage, emphasizing the equal footing achieved with men regarding age. The image avoids any text, relying on visual symbolism to convey the message.
