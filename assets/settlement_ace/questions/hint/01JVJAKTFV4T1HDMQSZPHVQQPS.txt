A hand-drawn, realistic, 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a diptych showcasing two distinct garden scenes. The left side represents Sissinghurst Castle Garden in Kent, England. Focus on the iconic White Garden, with its profusion of white flowers like roses, lilies, and irises, all meticulously arranged within geometric beds bordered by neatly trimmed hedges. A winding gravel path leads the viewer's eye towards a distant Elizabethan-era brick tower, partially obscured by climbing white roses. The overall color palette should lean towards whites, creams, and soft greens, creating a sense of serenity and curated beauty. On the right side of the diptych, illustrate Bodnant Garden in Wales. This scene should capture the vibrant colors and wilder feel of the garden. Depict the famous Laburnum Arch, a tunnel of cascading yellow flowers in full bloom. Underneath the arch, suggest a picnic scene with a checkered blanket, a basket, and scattered fruits and sandwiches. The background features the rolling hills of Snowdonia, painted in muted greens and blues. The sky above Bodnant should be slightly more dramatic with scattered clouds, hinting at the Welsh landscape. The overall color palette here should be richer, with yellows, greens, blues, and hints of purple from rhododendrons. The style should be detailed enough to distinguish the plant varieties but maintain a soft, watercolor aesthetic. The image should evoke a sense of tranquility and the diverse beauty of British gardens.
