A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a single, vibrant Tudor Rose in full bloom, centered against a soft, blurred background of rolling green hills reminiscent of the English countryside. The rose itself should be a bi-color variety, with the outer petals a deep crimson red and the inner petals a pristine white, subtly blending where they meet. Each petal should exhibit delicate veining and natural imperfections, rendered with fine brushstrokes to convey texture and depth. Dewdrops should cling to a few of the petals, catching the light and adding a touch of ephemeral beauty. The stem, a verdant green with subtle thorns, curves gracefully, leading down to a hint of rich, dark soil. The art style should evoke classic botanical illustrations, with an emphasis on accuracy and artistry. The colour palette should be dominated by reds, whites, and greens, subtly echoing the colours of the Union Jack, but in muted, pastel tones to create a calming and timeless aesthetic. The composition should be simple yet elegant, focusing solely on the rose as a symbol of England, with the background serving only to enhance its presence. The overall mood should be one of quiet beauty, historical significance, and national pride.
