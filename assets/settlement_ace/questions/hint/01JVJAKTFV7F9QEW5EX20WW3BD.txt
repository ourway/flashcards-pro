A whimsical, horizontally-oriented watercolor painting depicting four figures representing the patron saints of the UK, arranged left to right in chronological order of their feast days: David, Patrick, George, and Andrew. The background is a soft pastel gradient transitioning from a cool wintery blue on the right, to a warmer spring green in the center, and ending with a cool, late autumn grey on the left.

Saint David, positioned on the right side of the frame, is depicted as a kind, elderly man with a gentle smile, wearing traditional Welsh clothing, including a leek pinned to his hat. He is standing in a field of budding daffodils, a symbol of Wales, with a faint blue hue in the background.

Next to him, Saint Patrick is shown as a lively, bearded man in green robes, holding a shamrock. He stands amidst a field of shamrocks, with a slightly more vibrant green hue in the background, suggesting late spring.

To the left of Patrick, Saint George is portrayed as a valiant knight in shining armor, though his armor is polished to a soft sheen rather than a harsh glint. He carries a red and white flag bearing the St. George's Cross. The background shows a field of English roses in bloom, with a warm, sunny yellow hue.

Finally, on the far left, Saint Andrew is depicted as a wise, older gentleman with a long grey beard, dressed in traditional Scottish attire. He is holding a saltire (St. Andrew's Cross) flag. The background shows a landscape of thistle and misty mountains, with a greyish-blue hue indicating late autumn.

The figures are subtly connected by a winding path that mimics the changing seasons, starting in the wintery blue, flowing through the spring green and summer yellow, and ending in the autumnal grey. The overall impression is one of gentle progression and harmonious unity, encouraging retention of the correct order.
