A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting two stylized flags, one representing Poland and the other the United Kingdom. The Polish flag, a horizontal bicolor of white over red, is gently waving on the left. To the right, the Union Jack (UK flag) is depicted with equal prominence. Both flags are positioned in front of a stylized, pastel-colored illustration of the European Union flag, represented by a circle of twelve golden stars on a blue background. The stars should be subtly shimmering, suggesting unity and collaboration. The Polish flag should have a subtle, slightly worn texture to hint at its long history. The Union Jack is rendered with crisp, clean lines, reflecting its modern symbolism. The background should be a soft, blended wash of pastel blue and pink, reminiscent of a peaceful dawn, symbolizing new beginnings and international relations. The overall composition should be balanced and harmonious, with the flags clearly visible and easily distinguishable. The watercolor style should lend a sense of warmth and approachability, making the image memorable and educationally effective. The image should be strictly 2D, with no text or numbers included.
