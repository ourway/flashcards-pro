A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style, ratio 16:9. The scene depicts a rugged, determined Robert the Bruce, clad in historically accurate, slightly worn medieval Scottish attire of blues and greys with a flash of white from his tunic underneath, sprinting through a dense thicket of Scottish shrubbery, predominantly heather and gorse, in the Scottish Highlands. Focus the composition centrally, with the landscape stretching into the distance. The color palette should evoke the Scottish landscape, dominated by muted blues, greens, and purples, with touches of brown earth and golden gorse. The lighting suggests a late afternoon sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the texture of the foliage. Robert the Bruce's face is etched with determination, sweat glistening on his brow. He is not overly muscular but possesses a wiry strength. The shrubbery, or "brus," is rendered with painstaking detail, each leaf and thorn individually painted. In the background, mist-shrouded mountains rise majestically, their peaks capped with snow. A subtle but significant detail: a small, almost hidden Scottish thistle is subtly woven into the foreground vegetation. The overall impression should be one of historical accuracy, natural beauty, and determined action, creating a memorable visual link between Robert the Bruce and the Scottish landscape. The colour palette should be slightly pastel.
