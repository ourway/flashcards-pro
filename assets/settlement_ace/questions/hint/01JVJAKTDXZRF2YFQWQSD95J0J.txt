A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image depicting a vibrant cityscape nestled within a lush, green valley, evoking the natural beauty of Northern Ireland. The scene should be framed in a 16:9 landscape ratio, with the primary focus centered within the frame. The cityscape represents Belfast, characterized by a blend of historical and modern architecture rendered in pastel blues, creams, and subtle reds, subtly hinting at the colors of the UK flag. Prominent in the foreground is a majestic, stylized stag (a heraldic symbol often associated with strength and nobility), leaping gracefully over a gently flowing river that meanders through the city. The stag's antlers are adorned with delicate, blossoming shamrocks, symbolizing Ireland and its rich cultural heritage. Behind the stag, a stylized depiction of the Titanic Belfast museum rises, its iconic shape clearly visible, representing the city's industrial past and rebirth. Further in the background, rolling green hills dotted with sheep fade into a soft, pastel-colored sky with fluffy clouds. The overall impression should be one of growth, prosperity, and a harmonious blend of nature and urban life, subtly conveying the idea of Belfast as a thriving and central hub. The artistic style should be realistic yet gentle, avoiding harsh lines or overly detailed textures, creating a visually appealing and memorable image.
