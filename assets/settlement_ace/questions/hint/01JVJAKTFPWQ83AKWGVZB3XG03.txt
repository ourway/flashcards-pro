A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a serene yet historically significant scene. The composition centers on a classic British clock tower, reminiscent of Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben), its face prominently displaying the time: precisely 11:00 AM. The clock face is subtly adorned with three symbolic poppies, each representing one of the "eleven"s in the date and time of the war's end. Gentle rays of sunlight break through a soft, pastel-colored sky, casting a warm glow on the scene below. At the base of the tower, a peaceful park setting unfolds, populated by civilians dressed in early 20th-century attire, some releasing white doves into the air, symbolizing peace. The color palette leans towards a muted, pastel scheme, incorporating reds, whites, and blues subtly reminiscent of the Union Jack, but in a soft, understated manner. The overall mood is one of quiet remembrance and hopeful optimism, reflecting the solemnity of the war's end and the dawn of a new era. The level of detail should be high, capturing the texture of the stone tower, the delicate features of the clock face, and the subtle expressions of relief on the faces of the people in the park.
