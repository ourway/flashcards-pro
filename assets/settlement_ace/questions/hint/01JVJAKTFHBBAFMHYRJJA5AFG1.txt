A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the iconic Houses of Parliament in London. The composition is centered, adhering to the 16:9 aspect ratio. The House of Commons chamber is subtly highlighted with a warmer, brighter light, while the House of Lords chamber is rendered in cooler, more subdued tones. A large, ornate gavel, symbolizing authority and decision-making, is positioned directly above the House of Commons, casting a shadow over the House of Lords. The gavel is adorned with subtle UK flag colors, with a red handle, white head, and blue accents. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues, creating a soft, educational feel. The architectural details of both chambers should be accurate and detailed, showcasing the distinct characteristics of each house. The sky above the Houses of Parliament is a gentle gradient of blue and white, suggesting a clear, bright day. The River Thames flows calmly in the foreground, reflecting the Houses of Parliament, with a subtle ripple effect. The image should evoke a sense of order, history, and the balance of power within the British political system, emphasizing the supremacy of the House of Commons.
