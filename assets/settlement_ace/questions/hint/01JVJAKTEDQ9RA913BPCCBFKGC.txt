A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a serene landscape dominated by a majestic, fairytale-like castle nestled amidst rolling green hills. The castle's architecture should be distinctly German, reminiscent of Neuschwanstein, with prominent turrets, intricate stonework, and steeply pitched roofs. In the foreground, a bountiful beer garden scene unfolds, featuring wooden tables laden with overflowing steins of golden beer and pretzels. Patrons in traditional German attire – lederhosen and dirndls – are shown laughing and conversing. The color palette should be predominantly pastel, with soft greens, blues, and yellows evoking a sense of tranquility and nostalgia. The sky above is a gentle gradient of light blue and white, suggesting a peaceful, bright day. Sunlight gently illuminates the castle and beer garden, highlighting the intricate details of the architecture and the warmth of the social gathering. The composition should emphasize the connection between the iconic German castle and the culture of beer, visually linking Anne of Cleves to her German origins.
