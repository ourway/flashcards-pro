A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a pivotal scene representing the Reformation. The color palette leans towards a pastel combination of blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag. The central focus is a stylized quill pen, dramatically piercing through a large, ornate papal seal made of wax. Cracks radiate outward from the point of impact on the seal, symbolizing the fracturing of the Pope's authority. Around the pierced seal, scattered sheets of parchment display faint, handwritten script in Latin, partially obscured and fading into the background, indicating the old doctrines being challenged. In the background, a group of diverse figures is depicted in silhouette, their faces obscured, but their postures suggest a mixture of defiance, contemplation, and hope. These figures represent the collective movement of people questioning and re-evaluating religious authority. Light should emanate from behind the figures, suggesting the dawn of a new era of religious thought. The overall composition should convey a sense of dramatic change and intellectual rebellion. The style should be reminiscent of historical illustrations, with soft edges and delicate brushstrokes. The image is designed to evoke a sense of historical significance and the challenging of established power.
