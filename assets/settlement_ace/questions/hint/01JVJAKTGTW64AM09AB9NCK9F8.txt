A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, set against a soft, pastel-blue background. The central focus is a stylized shield, divided into two distinct sections. The left section features a vibrant, symbolic depiction of inclusivity for disability: a blooming sunflower (representing growth and resilience) next to a wheelchair user silhouette, subtly blended into the background to show that disability does not define them. The right section of the shield showcases two intertwined wedding rings, crafted from gold with a delicate sheen, resting on a bed of heather (a plant native to the UK, symbolizing love and good luck). This represents marital status. Soft, diffused light emanates from behind the shield, casting gentle shadows that accentuate the textures of the watercolor paper. The overall color palette should utilize pastel variations of red, white, and blue – echoing the colors of the UK flag – to create a sense of national identity and legal protection. The composition should be balanced and harmonious, with both sections of the shield receiving equal visual weight. The background should fade slightly towards the edges, drawing the viewer's attention to the central symbolic representation of disability and marital status being protected by law.
