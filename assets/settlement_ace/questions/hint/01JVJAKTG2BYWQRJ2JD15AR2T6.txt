A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image, in a realistic style, depicting the symbolic union of the Houses of York and Lancaster to form the House of Tudor. The composition is centered around two prominent roses: a white rose, representing the House of York, and a red rose, representing the House of Lancaster. These roses are not depicted as separate entities but are artistically intertwined and emerging from the same stem near the bottom of the image, visually symbolizing their unification. The stem is robust and healthy, signifying the strength of the newly formed Tudor dynasty. Above the roses, a Tudor rose blooms, showcasing the fusion of the white and red petals, symbolizing the creation of the House of Tudor. The Tudor rose should be predominantly red but with white accents, reflecting the blending of the two houses. The background is a soft, pastel-colored landscape reminiscent of the English countryside, with rolling green hills meeting a gentle, cloudy sky in pastel blue and white. The overall color palette should be gentle and harmonious, predominantly featuring pastel reds, whites, and greens, with subtle hints of gold to suggest royalty and heritage. The artwork should evoke a sense of peace, unity, and historical significance, capturing the essence of the merging of two powerful houses into one. The art style should be detailed and realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, to ensure that the image is both visually appealing and informative. The aspect ratio is 16:9.
