A vibrant, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the Welsh countryside. The scene is centered on a lush, green valley with rolling hills fading into a pastel-colored sky, reminiscent of a clear spring day in Wales. In the foreground, a group of diverse individuals is joyfully participating in a "sheep herding" activity, symbolizing the Welsh identity and culture. The sheep are arranged to subtly resemble the Olympic rings, with each ring represented by a different breed of Welsh sheep (e.g., Welsh Mountain sheep, Black Welsh Mountain sheep). The individuals are holding stylized "electoral ballots" instead of herding sticks, gently guiding the sheep. In the background, a quaint Welsh village is nestled among the hills, with a prominent clock tower displaying the time "4 o'clock." A subtle rainbow arches across the sky, its colors mirroring the colors of the Welsh flag. The overall composition is designed to evoke a sense of community, participation, and cyclical events, alluding to the four-year election cycle for the Welsh Assembly. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades with hints of red, white, and green, echoing both the UK flag and the Welsh landscape.
