A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, capturing the contrasting yet harmonious landscapes of Loch Lomond and Snowdonia in a 16:9 landscape format. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades, subtly incorporating the red, white, and blue of the UK flag. The composition is split, with Loch Lomond occupying the left half and Snowdonia the right, ensuring both are equally prominent in the center. On the left, depict a serene Loch Lomond, its surface reflecting the soft light of dawn, with gentle, rolling hills in the background adorned with lush greenery and scattered Scots Pines. A lone sailboat glides across the loch. On the right, portray the rugged, mountainous terrain of Snowdonia, with the peak of Snowdon partially shrouded in mist, creating an ethereal atmosphere. A winding path leads up the mountain, symbolizing exploration and discovery. The foreground should feature vibrant wildflowers native to Wales, such as Welsh poppies and Snowdon lilies. The overall mood should be peaceful and awe-inspiring, emphasizing the natural beauty and contrasting landscapes of the UK.
