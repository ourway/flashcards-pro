A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format, employing a pastel color palette dominated by soft blues, reds, and whites reminiscent of the UK flag. The central image depicts four distinct yet interconnected scenes, each representing a key duty of a Member of Parliament. The first scene, positioned on the left, shows a diverse group of people, symbolizing a constituency, gathered around a slightly elevated figure who is actively listening and taking notes, representing "Representing their constituencies." The second scene, slightly right of the center, portrays a quill pen writing on parchment beside a stack of bound books, signifying "Creating new laws." The third scene, placed just left of the center, features a magnifying glass examining a building that resembles the Houses of Parliament, symbolizing "Scrutinizing government actions." The fourth scene, on the right side, shows two figures in a passionate, yet respectful debate at a round table, with papers scattered around, representing "Debating key national issues." Each scene is framed by subtle, ornate borders, tying them together visually. The background is a soft, muted wash of watercolor, suggesting a sense of historical importance and the weight of these responsibilities. The overall composition aims to balance clarity with artistic detail, creating a memorable visual mnemonic for the four duties of Members of Parliament.
