A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, portraying two distinct yet interconnected garden scenes, side-by-side, within a 16:9 landscape format. The left side, bathed in cool blues and greens reminiscent of the UK flag, depicts a meticulously ordered English garden, symbolizing "Sense." Neatly trimmed hedges form geometric patterns, and flowers are arranged in precise rows. A stone sundial stands prominently, casting a long, accurate shadow. A woman in a regency-era dress is carefully pruning roses, her expression calm and controlled. The right side, in contrast, bursts with warm reds, pinks, and yellows, representing "Sensibility." This garden is wilder and more untamed, overflowing with roses, honeysuckle, and lavender. Butterflies flutter freely, and a small fountain bubbles playfully. A woman in a similar dress, but with loosened hair and flushed cheeks, is smelling a rose with intense emotion. A gentle, pastel-colored rainbow arches subtly above both gardens, connecting them visually. The composition emphasizes the contrast and harmony between the two gardens, hinting at the novel's exploration of reason and emotion. The overall tone should be elegant, sophisticated, and slightly romantic, capturing the essence of Jane Austen's era and literary themes, all while avoiding any text or numbers.
