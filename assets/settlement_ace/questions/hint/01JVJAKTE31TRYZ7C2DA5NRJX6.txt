A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a regal owl, symbolizing the monarch, perched on a stack of leather-bound books within a grand, oak-paneled study reminiscent of a room in Buckingham Palace. The owl, rendered in soft, muted blues and grays with touches of gold around its intelligent eyes, gazes knowingly towards a miniature figure of a Prime Minister standing on the desk below. The Prime Minister figure, painted in pastel shades of beige and light gray, is depicted listening attentively, with a slightly furrowed brow suggesting contemplation. The study is bathed in a warm, diffused light filtering through a tall, arched window draped with crimson curtains. The books are subtly labelled with symbols representing key areas of governance - a scales for justice, a shield for defense, and a caduceus for health. A quill and inkwell sit beside the books, hinting at historical records and thoughtful advice. The overall composition should convey a sense of wisdom, guidance, and the weight of responsibility, emphasizing the advisory role of the monarch. The color palette should lean towards pastel variations of the UK flag colors (red, white, and blue), incorporating creamy whites, muted reds, and soft blues to create a visually calming and dignified scene. The style should be realistic with detailed textures of the owl's feathers and the wood grain of the desk.
