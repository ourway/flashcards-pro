A vibrant, watercolor-style landscape depicting the Welsh countryside, set against a clear, pastel-blue sky. In the foreground, three distinct hills rise gently, each representing a city: Cardiff, Swansea, and Newport. Each hill is adorned with a symbolic element: Cardiff features a miniature, stylized Welsh dragon perched atop, Swansea boasts a small, elegant sailing boat on its slope, and Newport displays a depiction of its famous Transporter Bridge rendered in delicate lines. The three hills are nestled closely together, emphasizing their geographical proximity within Wales. A winding river, colored in shades of turquoise and blue, flows through the valley, visually connecting the three cities. Behind the hills, a subtle, almost ethereal mountain range fades into the distance, colored in soft purples and grays. In the far distance, a faint, symbolic line stretches horizontally across the horizon, subtly separating the Welsh landscape from a flat, muted-beige plain representing England, which is noticeably devoid of distinct features or points of interest, serving as a visual cue that the vibrant cities are not located within it. The color palette is dominated by the pastel reds and whites of the Welsh flag, evoking a sense of national identity and pride. The overall composition is serene and inviting, designed to create a memorable association between the three cities and their location within the unique and picturesque landscape of Wales, distinct from England.
