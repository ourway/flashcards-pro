A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a scene from the English Civil War. The image is in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is King Charles I, mounted on a majestic white horse, his regal attire subtly incorporating the red and blue of the Union Jack within its design. He wears polished armor, with a flowing red sash. Behind him, a group of elegantly dressed Cavaliers are riding horses, their plumed hats and long hair are prominent features. Their clothing uses a pastel colour pallete of reds, blues and creams. The Cavaliers carry banners displaying stylized royal emblems, such as a crown intertwined with roses. The backdrop features a softly rendered, rolling English countryside, with a hint of a medieval castle in the distance. The sky is a muted blue, reminiscent of a watercolour painting, adding to the historical atmosphere. The composition should evoke a sense of loyalty, nobility, and the historical context of the English Civil War, with the Cavaliers clearly positioned as supporters of the King. The style should be detailed and realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and maintain a high level of visual clarity suitable for educational purposes.
