A hand-drawn, watercolour-style image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a winding country road in Northern Ireland. The road is flanked by rolling green hills dotted with sheep, under a pastel blue sky with soft, white clouds. In the foreground, a red car with a white roof (resembling the UK flag colours) is driving along the road. Prominently displayed on the rear window of the car is a large, easily visible 'R' plate, coloured in red and white. Around the car, subtly integrated into the landscape, are visual cues representing the passage of time: a blossoming apple tree transitioning from spring blossoms to ripe apples (representing the changing seasons), a sundial partially obscured by long grass, and a flock of birds migrating across the sky. These elements should be painted in soft, pastel shades. The overall style should be realistic but with a gentle, illustrative quality, evoking a sense of peaceful countryside and the slow passage of a year. The composition should focus on the car and the 'R' plate, with the background elements providing context and reinforcing the time aspect.
