A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a scene outside a traditional British corner shop. The shop's facade should be subtly rendered in pastel shades, primarily light blues and creams, evoking a sense of classic British architecture. The focal point is a young individual, appearing no older than 17, reaching for a packet of cigarettes displayed behind the counter. The shopkeeper, a mature and stern-looking individual with a kind face, gently shakes their head and holds up a hand in a gesture of refusal. A clear, universally recognizable "No Entry" symbol, consisting of a red circle with a diagonal line, is subtly superimposed over the cigarette packet. The colour theme should primarily resemble the UK flag. The background should include subtle details, such as a traditional red telephone box and a glimpse of a double-decker bus passing by, reinforcing the British setting. The overall atmosphere should be one of calm refusal and adherence to the law, emphasizing the message that tobacco sale is prohibited to minors. The art style should be reminiscent of classic British illustrations, with a focus on detailed realism and soft, watercolour textures. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a welcoming yet firm atmosphere.
