A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style (pastel colour palette) depicting a British queen in her royal attire, seated gracefully on a throne. The throne room is bathed in soft, warm light, with subtle details like the British flag subtly draped in the background as a tapestry. The queen is holding a sceptre in one hand, subtly radiating a gentle glow. Her posture is elegant and gracious, emphasizing her noble bearing. Around the queen, depict symbolic representations of British values and heritage, such as a blooming rose (England's national flower), a thistle (Scotland), a daffodil (Wales) and a shamrock (Northern Ireland), all arranged in a harmonious composition. The overall composition should evoke a sense of serenity, nobility, and the enduring legacy of the British monarchy. A stained glass window behind the throne should showcase subtle imagery related to British history and culture. The colour palette should lean towards pastel blues, soft pinks, and gentle yellows, reflecting the colours of the UK flag, but in a muted, elegant tone. The image should avoid any harsh lines or stark contrasts, aiming for a soft and inviting aesthetic that conveys a sense of 'Gracious' and 'Noble'.
