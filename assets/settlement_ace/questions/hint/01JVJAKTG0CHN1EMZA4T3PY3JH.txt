A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a serene scene set against the backdrop of the European continent, subtly outlined in the pastel shades of blue and white. The focal point is a grand, yet inviting, European-style building, bathed in soft, golden light, representing the "Right to Liberty and Security." The building's architecture blends classical and modern elements, symbolizing the enduring yet evolving nature of human rights. Within the building's open courtyard, rendered in pastel red hues, a group of diverse individuals is depicted engaged in a fair trial. A central figure, representing justice, is shown impartially listening to both sides of an argument. Symbolic scales of justice are subtly incorporated into the courtyard's design, balanced perfectly. The scene should evoke a sense of peace, security, and fairness. The composition should be balanced, with the building centrally located and the trial scene in the foreground. The overall color palette should be pastel, with blues, whites, and reds predominating, subtly referencing the UK flag and reinforcing the British commitment to these European principles. The sky above is a gentle gradient of pastel blues and whites, suggesting hope and clarity.
