A meticulously detailed, realistic watercolour painting in a pastel colour palette (primarily blues, pinks, and creams) depicting a golden retriever dog standing patiently in a lush, green park. The park should have a classic British feel, with a winding stone path visible in the background and mature oak trees with dappled sunlight filtering through their leaves. The dog is the main focus, and it is wearing a clearly visible, light blue leather collar. Affixed to the collar is a small, polished silver tag that reflects the light slightly. Although there is no actual text, the tag should be shaped like a miniature, stylized British house, subtly suggesting the idea of an address. The dog's fur is realistically rendered, with individual strands visible, and its expression is gentle and intelligent. The overall impression is one of domestic tranquility and responsible pet ownership in a quintessential British setting. The background should be slightly blurred to keep the focus on the dog and its collar. The lighting should be soft and natural, contributing to the calming and educational tone of the image. The composition should be centered, with the dog taking up a significant portion of the frame, emphasizing the importance of the collar.
