A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape ratio. The central focus is a grand, stylized depiction of the Northern Ireland Assembly chamber. Instead of rows of individual seats, the chamber is filled with a collection of exactly 90 unique chairs. Each chair is slightly different in design, some upholstered in shades of green and orange (representing Irish cultures), others in subtle blues and greys (representing the unionist cultures), but all arranged in a semi-circular formation facing a raised speaker's platform. The platform is crafted from dark, polished wood, and behind it hangs a stylized banner representing the six counties of Northern Ireland, each county symbolized by a unique, hand-drawn emblem (a flax flower for County Antrim, a harp for County Armagh, etc.) rendered in pastel colors. Subtle shafts of light stream in from arched windows along the top of the image, illuminating the chairs and creating a sense of depth and importance. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, green, and cream, evoking a sense of calm and order. The absence of 120 chairs will help the student to memorise that the statement "How many members are in the Northern Ireland Assembly? 120" is false.
