A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting the Olympic rings soaring above a stylized London skyline. The sky is a gradient of pastel blues and pinks, reminiscent of a summer dawn, mirroring colors of the UK flag. Below the Olympic rings, the River Thames meanders through the city, rendered in shimmering, reflective blues and silvers. Iconic London landmarks, such as the Houses of Parliament with the Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben), the London Eye, and the Shard, are subtly included, each uniquely designed to capture the UK's architectural landscape. The Olympic rings themselves are interlaced and radiate a soft, golden light, symbolizing unity and achievement. Below the skyline, a diverse group of athletes is depicted in silhouette, representing various sports, their forms dynamic and full of movement, suggesting the energy and competition of the games. The colour palette should focus on pastel blues, pinks, whites, and golds, creating a sense of celebration and grandeur. The overall composition should be balanced and harmonious, drawing the viewer's eye to the central focus: the Olympic rings above London.
