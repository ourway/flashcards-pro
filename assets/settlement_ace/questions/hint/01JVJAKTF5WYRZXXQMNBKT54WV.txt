A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a stylized battlefield scene representing the Wars of the Roses. The scene is viewed from a slightly elevated perspective, focusing on the central area of conflict. The ground is a mix of earthy browns and greens, subtly suggesting a field, yet also stained with muted reds and whites. Predominantly in the center, scattered across the landscape, are vibrant red roses and pristine white roses, visually distinct and intermingled, symbolizing the Houses of Lancaster and York, respectively. Some roses appear fresh and vibrant, while others are slightly wilted or torn, signifying the casualties and devastation of war. The sky above is a soft, pastel blue, with hints of grey clouds gathering in the distance, evoking a sense of somberness and historical weight. In the background, faint silhouettes of medieval-style banners bearing simplified rose emblems (one red, one white) can be seen, adding depth and context without being overtly detailed. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades, with the red and white roses providing the most striking contrast against the muted background. The composition should emphasize the chaotic yet beautiful scattering of roses, creating a visually memorable representation of the conflict's name: The Wars of the Roses.
