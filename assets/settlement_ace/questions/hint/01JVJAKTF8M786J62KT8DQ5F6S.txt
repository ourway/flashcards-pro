A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a round table situated at the heart of the United Nations headquarters, but instead of delegates, fifteen diverse figures are seated around it, symbolizing members of the UN Security Council. The figures are depicted as archetypes representing different global regions and cultures, subtly suggesting the international composition of the council. Dominant colors should be pastel blues and whites, subtly reminiscent of the UN flag, with touches of pastel red to tie into the UK's flag colours. The table is ornately carved with subtle symbols of peace, justice, and diplomacy. Each figure is holding a unique item that represents their respective region's contribution to global peace, such as an olive branch, a book, a tool, or a musical instrument. Light streams in from a high window, casting a soft, diffused glow on the scene, emphasizing the seriousness and importance of the council's work. The background should be a watercolour wash of soft blue, representing the sky, blending into the building's interior. The art style evokes a sense of historical importance and global unity, reminding the viewer of the council's role in maintaining international security. The overall composition should be balanced and harmonious, with all fifteen figures clearly visible and distinct, contributing to a sense of collaborative effort.
