A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, rendered in a pastel color palette. The central focus is a stylized, yet scientifically accurate, depiction of a double helix DNA molecule, its strands interwoven with delicate precision. The background features an idealized rendering of the Cambridge University campus, showcasing its iconic architecture, including King's College Chapel with its recognizable spires. The buildings are bathed in soft, warm light, emphasizing their historical significance and the pursuit of knowledge within their walls. Subtle symbolic elements are incorporated: open books resting near the base of the DNA structure, alluding to the academic research and scholarly dedication required for such a discovery. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, with the DNA molecule as the primary subject, gently illuminated against the backdrop of Cambridge University. The sky above Cambridge should be a clear, pale blue, contributing to the overall serene and intellectual atmosphere of the scene. The image should evoke a sense of scientific breakthrough and the historical importance of Cambridge University's contribution to understanding the building blocks of life. The style should be reminiscent of classic scientific illustrations, combining accuracy with artistic flair to create a memorable and educational visual.
