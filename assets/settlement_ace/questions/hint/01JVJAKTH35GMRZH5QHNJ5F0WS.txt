A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant panorama of Cardiff, the capital city of Wales. The composition is centered around Cardiff Castle, rendered with historical accuracy, its stone walls bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun. In the foreground, the River Taff meanders gently, reflecting the colors of the sky and the castle. On the river, a traditional Welsh coracle boat is being paddled. The skyline is dominated by the Principality Stadium, depicted with its iconic architectural features. The surrounding cityscape should include a harmonious blend of modern buildings and historic architecture. Subtle Welsh flags are waving gently atop key buildings, adding a touch of national identity without being overtly prominent. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades, incorporating blues, whites, and reds reminiscent of the Union Jack, but in softer tones, creating a calming and inviting atmosphere. The art style should be reminiscent of classic travel illustrations, with attention to detail and a focus on capturing the unique character of Cardiff. The sky should be a blend of soft blues, pinks, and oranges, creating a tranquil and picturesque backdrop. The image should evoke a sense of pride and cultural richness, highlighting Cardiff's significance as the heart of Wales.
