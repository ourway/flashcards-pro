A hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a stylized map of Europe. The map should utilize a pastel color palette, primarily blues, reds, and whites reminiscent of the UK flag. The landmasses of the European countries are simplified yet recognizable. The United Kingdom is prominently featured on the northwestern edge of the map, with slightly brighter colors than the other countries, drawing the viewer's eye. The UK is not detached from the continent, but sitting very close to the European mainland. Symbolic elements include a faint compass rose subtly overlaid on the map, with the northwest quadrant slightly emphasized through a gentle shift in color saturation, creating a visual cue. The overall composition should evoke a sense of geographical location and direction without using any text, numbers, or arrows. The water surrounding Europe should be a soft, blended blue, creating a calming and educational visual. The image ratio should be 16:9, with the main subject, the UK in the Northwest, centered within the frame. The art style should resemble a vintage map, giving it an aged and distinguished appearance.
