A watercolor illustration in a realistic style, focusing on the interior of a shared house in the UK. The color palette leans towards the pastel spectrum, with subtle hints of red, white, and blue echoing the UK flag. The scene is divided into four distinct rooms, each visibly separated by walls and doorways. Each room has a television set, each of which is on and displaying different programs. The composition is centered, showing the four rooms equally. At the center of the image, subtly placed, are four envelopes resting on a small table. Each envelope is addressed to "The Occupant" of each respective room, with a small, stylized television icon stamped on each. The envelopes are clearly separate, symbolizing individual responsibilities. A sense of domesticity pervades the scene, with each room showing signs of individual habitation â€“ a book in one, a plant in another, a musical instrument in another, and a framed picture in the last. The overall impression should be one of distinct spaces within a single dwelling, emphasizing the idea of individual living arrangements rather than a single, unified household. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere that avoids harsh shadows or stark contrasts. The hand-drawn watercolor style should lend a gentle, approachable feel to the subject matter, making it memorable and educational.
