A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic, 2D watercolour illustration in a pastel colour palette, reminiscent of historical maritime paintings. The central focus is a majestic, albeit slightly stylized, depiction of Trafalgar Square in London. Instead of the usual bustling crowds, the square is subtly underwater, with gentle, flowing currents indicated by softly blurred lines. Nelson's Column stands tall, its base partially submerged, but the statue of Admiral Nelson at the top remains clear and prominent, gazing out towards the horizon. Around the base of the column, instead of lions, are realistically drawn dolphins and other marine life subtly circling. Light filters down from the surface, creating dappled patterns on the buildings surrounding the square â€“ a slightly distorted but recognizable National Gallery and St. Martin-in-the-Fields church. The colour scheme should primarily use pale blues, greens, and creams, with touches of faded gold on the statue and architectural details. The overall mood should be serene and slightly melancholic, reflecting the historical significance and the sacrifice of Admiral Nelson. The sky is visible above the water, painted in soft, watercolour washes of pale blue and grey, hinting at a distant, overcast day. The composition should draw the eye upwards towards Nelson's statue, emphasizing his enduring legacy within the heart of London.
