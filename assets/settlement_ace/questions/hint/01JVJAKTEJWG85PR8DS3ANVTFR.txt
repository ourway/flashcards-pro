A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a Beefeater standing proudly in front of the iconic White Tower at the Tower of London. The Beefeater is in full traditional uniform, his red coat vibrant against the muted stone of the tower. He holds a halberd, its metal gleaming subtly. Surrounding him are a diverse group of tourists, their faces reflecting a mix of awe and interest as they listen intently. The White Tower rises majestically behind the Beefeater, its Norman architecture rendered with careful attention to detail, from the crenellations to the small, arched windows. A flock of ravens circles the tower in the background, adding a touch of mystique. The composition should be centered, with the Beefeater and the White Tower as the primary focus. The colours should be primarily red (for the Beefeater's uniform) and grey/beige (for the tower), with touches of green in the surrounding grass and blue in the sky, subtly evoking the colours of the UK flag. The overall mood is one of historical significance and cultural heritage. The image should be 16:9 and landscape oriented. The sky should be slightly overcast, casting soft shadows that accentuate the textures of the stone and fabric. The art style should resemble a detailed historical illustration found in a textbook.
