A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, focusing on symbolic representations of "Defence" and "Immigration" within the context of the UK. The colour palette should primarily consist of pastel blues, reds, and whites, echoing the colours of the Union Jack. Centrally positioned is a stylized, but realistic, depiction of the white cliffs of Dover, topped with a modern British Army soldier standing guard, rifle at the ready, silhouetted against a soft, pastel-blue sky. The soldier represents "Defence." Towards the base of the cliffs, a winding path leads upwards from a calm, pastel-blue sea where a small, stylized boat is approaching. The boat is filled with diverse figures, representing "Immigration." These figures are not overly detailed but are clearly multicultural. The sea should gently lap against the base of the cliffs. Above the cliffs, subtle contrails from jet planes arc across the sky, further reinforcing the theme of national defence. The overall composition should be balanced and serene, but with a clear emphasis on the soldier and the approaching boat as the central subjects. The rendering should be detailed enough to convey realism but retain the soft, approachable aesthetic of watercolour. The cliffs should be textured to show the natural strata. The sky should have a gradient of pastel blues, suggesting a peaceful but watchful atmosphere. The entire image should be framed within a 16:9 aspect ratio, with the main subjects occupying the central area of the frame.
