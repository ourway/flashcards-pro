A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a scene set in 1928 England. The composition should be in a 16:9 landscape format, with the primary focus centered. The scene features a jubilant crowd of women, diverse in age and social class, gathered outside a polling station. They are holding hand-painted signs featuring symbolic representations of equality, such as balanced scales and intertwined gender symbols. The women are dressed in fashionable 1920s attire – flapper dresses, cloche hats, and long strands of pearls – rendered in a soft pastel color palette with hints of red, white, and blue to subtly evoke the UK flag. The polling station's architecture is distinctly British, with red brick walls and a prominent Union Jack flag waving gently above the entrance. In the foreground, a suffragette rosette is pinned to one of the women's dresses, a nod to the historical struggle for women's suffrage. The overall mood is celebratory and empowering, capturing the historical significance of women achieving voting equality. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The style should evoke vintage posters and artwork from the 1920s, with attention to detail in the clothing, architecture, and facial expressions.
