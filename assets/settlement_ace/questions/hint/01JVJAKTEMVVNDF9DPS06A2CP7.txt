A detailed, hand-drawn, watercolour-style 2D image depicting a grand, ornate, British-style building representing HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The building's architecture should be inspired by classic British government buildings, with subtle hints of the UK flag's colours (red bricks, white stone detailing, blue-slate roof) integrated into the design. Emanating from the building's doors and windows are numerous streams of golden coins and banknotes, forming a radiant, centralized flow towards the building. These streams originate from various sources representing the public: a small market stall overflowing with produce, a construction worker's hard hat, an artist's easel, and a doctor's stethoscope, all subtly coloured in pastel shades. The composition should emphasize the central role of HMRC as the collector, with all economic activity visualized as contributing to this central point. The overall style should be realistic yet slightly whimsical, reminiscent of a storybook illustration, with soft, pastel colours dominating the palette, punctuated by the gold of the currency flowing towards HMRC. The ratio is 16:9 and landscape, with the HMRC building in the center.
