A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, rendered in pastel colours. The composition is centered, adhering to a 16:9 landscape ratio. The focal point is an ornate, antique printing press, crafted from dark wood and gleaming brass, positioned centrally. Sheets of blank parchment are stacked neatly to its side. Emerging from the press, instead of printed text, are flocks of doves taking flight, each bird carrying a miniature quill pen in its beak. The doves ascend towards a soft, pastel blue sky, breaking apart symbolic chains that dissolve into harmless, glittering dust motes. In the background, subtly blurred, is a representation of the Houses of Parliament, depicted in soft grey stone, its details gently faded. The overall scene evokes a sense of liberation, knowledge, and the free flow of information. The pastel colour palette, dominated by blues, creams, and light browns, creates a calm and dignified atmosphere, reminiscent of historical documents and the dawn of a new era. The entire image should feel like a snapshot from a historical painting, emphasizing the significance of the printing press as a symbol of freedom and the power of the written word.
