A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style depicting a grand international festival representing the United Nations. The scene unfolds in a sprawling, stylized garden reminiscent of Kew Gardens in London, but with global flora subtly incorporated. In the centre, a large, round stage is subtly patterned with a world map design. Around the stage, groups of people dressed in diverse national costumes are joyfully celebrating. There are approximately 190 distinct groups, each small and representing a country, subtly suggested by unique clothing and cultural items. The color palette primarily consists of pastel shades of blue, red, and white, mirroring the UK flag, with accents of other pastel colors to represent global diversity. The overall composition conveys a sense of unity and collaboration. Small, stylized doves, symbols of peace, fly above the crowd. The illustration focuses on the human element, capturing the joy and energy of the international gathering, with each national group distinctly but harmoniously represented. The sky is a soft, watercolour gradient of blue and white, creating a cheerful and optimistic atmosphere. The style aims to be realistic yet whimsical, evoking a sense of celebration and international cooperation, with the number of represented groups being visually suggested without explicitly numbering them.
