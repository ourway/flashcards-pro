A watercolour illustration in a realistic style, with a pastel colour palette and a 16:9 ratio. The central focus is on a stylized, yet realistic, representation of a British Youth Court interior. In the foreground, a young person sits at a table, their face softly blurred or obscured by an artistic "light leak" effect, suggesting anonymity. Surrounding them are muted figures representing court officials, also partially obscured. The backdrop features a large, stylised British flag, with the red and blue tones softened into pastel shades. Emanating from the young person is a radiant, protective aura depicted in light yellow and white, symbolizing the safeguarding of their identity. Extending from the aura are stylized "camera flashes" being gently pushed away by a translucent, hand-drawn shield, representing the media's inability to penetrate the privacy. The overall composition should convey a sense of protection, privacy, and the importance of safeguarding young individuals within the British legal system. The colour scheme should primarily use pastel blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag, to reinforce the British context. No text should be included in the image.
