A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image depicting the scales of justice, perfectly balanced, set against the backdrop of a stylized British cityscape at twilight. The scales are crafted from polished, dark wood and gleam subtly under the soft light. Instead of traditional pans, one side of the scale holds a miniature police officer figurine in classic uniform, looking slightly downcast, while the other side holds a symbolic representation of the Crown Jewels, rendered in pastel shades of blue, red and white, signifying the law. The cityscape features iconic silhouettes of London landmarks like the Houses of Parliament and Tower Bridge, subtly blurred to maintain focus on the scales. Light from the street lamps casts long shadows, adding depth and realism. The color palette leans towards a calming blend of pastel blues, grays, and muted reds, reminiscent of the Union Jack, creating a serious yet hopeful atmosphere. The overall composition emphasizes balance and accountability, visually reinforcing the concept that even those in positions of authority are subject to the law. The art style should be realistic with finely detailed brushstrokes to ensure a high level of realism, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements.
