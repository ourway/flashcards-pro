A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The scene depicts a slightly stylized, yet recognizable portrait of Winston Churchill, centrally positioned. He's wearing his iconic pinstripe suit, bow tie, and is holding a cigar, all rendered with careful attention to detail. Behind him, subtly blended into the background, is the faint outline of the Houses of Parliament, coloured in pastel shades of blue and grey. Emerging from the bottom right of the frame is a determined bulldog, looking upwards towards Churchill, symbolizing his resilience and tenacity. The bulldog is coloured in light beige and white with a British flag collar. Light is coming from the top left corner of the image, illuminating Churchill's face and casting soft shadows that add depth and dimension. The overall color palette leans towards the red, white, and blue of the Union Jack, using muted, pastel tones to create a sense of history and gravitas. The style should evoke classic British portraiture, but with a slight contemporary twist to make it visually engaging for a modern audience. The entire composition aims to create a memorable association between Churchill and his enduring legacy as a great British leader.
