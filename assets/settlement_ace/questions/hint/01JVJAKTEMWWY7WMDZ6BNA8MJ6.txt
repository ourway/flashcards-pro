A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the Isle of Man as a distinct, self-contained island. The island is rendered in soft, pastel greens and browns, showcasing its rolling hills and coastline. The sea surrounding the Isle of Man should be a gentle, pastel blue. Dominating the center of the island is the Tower of Refuge, rendered in shades of white and grey. Hovering gently above the Isle of Man, not touching it, is a stylized, simplified version of the British Crown, radiating a soft, golden light. The crown should be clearly recognizable but not overly ornate, maintaining the overall soft aesthetic. The orientation should focus on the island and the crown, with the surrounding sea and sky acting as a calming, supportive background. The entire image should evoke a sense of serene independence and close proximity but not integration. The colours should be predominantly pastel. The island sits prominently in the center of the frame, with the crown positioned directly above it, creating a visual connection without physical contact, symbolizing the Isle of Man's status as a Crown Dependency but with its own distinct identity.
