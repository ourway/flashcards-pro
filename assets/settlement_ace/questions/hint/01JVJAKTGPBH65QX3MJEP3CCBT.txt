A hand-drawn, realistic, 2D watercolor painting in a pastel color palette, depicting a serene British landscape during the 3rd or 4th century AD. The focal point is a gentle, rolling hillside dotted with sheep grazing peacefully. In the middle ground, a small, unassuming stone building with a simple wooden cross above the entrance is visible, subtly suggesting an early Christian church. Roman soldiers are depicted marching on a road in the background, their presence signifying the Roman Empire's influence during this era. The sky is a soft, pastel blue with gentle, fluffy white clouds. Sunlight bathes the scene, creating a sense of peace and tranquility. Hidden among the sheep, some of them have subtle crosses on their wool. The overall composition should evoke a sense of history and the quiet beginnings of Christianity in Britain, contrasting the power of the Roman Empire with the humble origins of the faith. The image should subtly hint at the correct answer without being overly explicit, allowing the viewer to make the connection between the visual elements and the question.
