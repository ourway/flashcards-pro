A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image in a 16:9 landscape format. The scene centers around a grand, yet welcoming, town hall interior. Dominating the composition is a figure in mayoral regalia: a distinguished individual, possibly female, wearing a traditional mayoral chain of office, subtly incorporating the colors of the UK flag (red, white, and blue) in its design. The chain should feature symbolic pendants, perhaps small shields bearing local emblems or historical insignias. The mayor stands on a slightly raised platform, addressing a diverse group of community members seated in rows of chairs. Pastel colors should dominate the palette, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The background includes details such as arched windows allowing soft, natural light to filter in, portraits of past mayors adorning the walls, and subtle architectural details characteristic of British town halls, such as Corinthian columns or decorative plasterwork. A small, ornate table is placed in front of the mayor, holding a gavel and a book, possibly a record of council proceedings. The overall impression is one of civic duty, tradition, and community leadership, designed to evoke the idea of a mayor as the ceremonial head of a local council.
