A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting the interior of a modern British car, focusing on the windscreen area. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues and grays, with subtle accents of red. The steering wheel is on the right side of the car. The dashboard is clean and uncluttered. The central focus is on the windscreen, which is completely clear and unobstructed. Sunlight gently streams through the glass, illuminating the interior. A smartphone is mounted on the dashboard via a holder. The phone screen displays a stylized, simplified representation of the UK road network, with a small, green tick symbol superimposed on it, symbolizing the successful online payment of road tax. The background, visible through the windscreen, shows a blurred view of a typical British suburban street with houses and greenery, rendered in soft, muted tones. The overall impression should be one of cleanliness, modernity, and ease, emphasizing the digital nature of the road tax payment system and the absence of any physical disc. The art style should be reminiscent of classic motoring illustrations, but with a contemporary twist.
