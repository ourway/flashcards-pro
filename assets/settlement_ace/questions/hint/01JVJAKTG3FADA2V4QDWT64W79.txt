A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format. The composition is centered around a vintage-style compass rose, its needle pointing directly upwards (North). The compass is rendered with intricate detail, showcasing aged brass and delicate engravings. The background features a soft, pastel-colored map of the island of Ireland, with the northern part of the island subtly desaturated to appear slightly faded compared to the rest. Overlaid on the map, and slightly obscuring the compass, is a faint, ghostly image of a church building, depicted in a translucent, ethereal manner. The church lacks solid lines and appears almost like a mirage, symbolizing the absence of an established church in Northern Ireland. The color palette is primarily pastel blues, greens, and yellows, with touches of muted red in the compass rose, reminiscent of the UK flag's colors. The overall style is realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, to ensure clarity and educational value. The effect is intended to be dreamlike and memorable, visually connecting the compass pointing North with the idea of a non-established church in that region of Ireland. The subtle fade of the northern part of Ireland on the map further emphasizes the specific area being referenced.
