A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor painting in a realistic style (not cartoonish) depicting two distinct scenes separated by a subtly winding river. The overall palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, evoking a vintage, literary feel.

On the left side, Thomas Hardy is represented by a picturesque view of the Wessex countryside. Rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep and quaint stone cottages dominate the scene. A lone, weathered oak tree stands prominently, its branches reaching towards a soft, overcast sky. A dirt path meanders through the landscape, suggesting a journey. A quill and inkwell rest beside an open book at the base of the tree, subtly implying Hardy's connection to the land and its stories. A traditional shepherd crook leans against the tree trunk.

On the right side, Graham Greene is symbolized by a shadowy, cobbled alleyway in a European city, perhaps Vienna (a nod to "The Third Man"). A single, flickering gas lamp casts long, dramatic shadows. A fedora hat and trench coat hang over a chair outside a cafe, suggesting intrigue and mystery. A partially obscured figure lurks in the background, adding to the atmosphere of suspense. A vintage suitcase sits open on the cobblestones, revealing a film reel, hinting at Greene's cinematic storytelling. The river subtly separates the two scenes, representing the passage of time and the different genres of literature.
