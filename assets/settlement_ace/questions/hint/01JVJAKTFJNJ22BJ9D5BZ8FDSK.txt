A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting, ratio 16:9, depicting a quaint Scottish village scene with a focus on a modest courthouse. The color palette leans heavily on pastel blues, reds, and creams, reminiscent of the UK flag but softened for a gentle, educational feel. In the center of the image, the Justice of the Peace Court stands as a simple, stone building with a slate roof, a small, welcoming entrance, and traditional Scottish architectural details. The courthouse is framed by flowering heather bushes in vibrant purples and greens, typical of the Scottish Highlands. A cobblestone path leads to the entrance, where a single, elderly figure, representing the Justice of the Peace, stands holding a set of scales, symbolizing justice. The figure is dressed in muted tweed clothing. Surrounding the courthouse, depict a peaceful village scene with rolling green hills in the background. A few villagers are visible, going about their daily lives, creating a sense of community and illustrating the court's role within it. The sky is soft and overcast, typical of Scotland, adding to the serene and thoughtful atmosphere. The overall composition should evoke a sense of calm and fairness, emphasizing the accessibility and localized nature of the Justice of the Peace Court.
