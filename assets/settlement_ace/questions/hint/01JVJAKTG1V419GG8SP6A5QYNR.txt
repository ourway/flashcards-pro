A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical painting. The scene depicts King Henry VIII, regal in Tudor attire with a rich, velvet red robe trimmed with gold, standing in the center of the composition. He is holding a large, ornate sword aloft with both hands, his face determined and resolute. The sword is positioned mid-swing as though he is actively severing a thick, heavy chain. One end of the chain is connected to his royal crown, and the other end stretches into the distance, leading to a grand, imposing structure representing the Church of Rome. This structure is designed in the style of St. Peter's Basilica, with a clear depiction of its dome and classical architectural elements. The sky is a dramatic blend of blues and grays, hinting at the turmoil and revolution that his actions initiated. The color palette should be dominated by reds, golds, and blues, drawing inspiration from the UK flag while maintaining a sense of historical authenticity. The composition should emphasize the separation and the finality of the cut, visually symbolizing Henry VIII's severing ties with the Church of Rome. The landscape around Henry VIII should be a classic English countryside, rolling green hills, and a cloudy sky.
