A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical watercolors, depicting a stylized clash between English and French forces during the Hundred Years' War. The image is set against a backdrop of rolling green hills, characteristic of the English countryside, meeting the distant, softer blue-grey cliffs of the French coast on the horizon. In the foreground, English longbowmen, clad in simple but functional armor, stand their ground, bows drawn, facing a charge of French knights in shining, ornate armor atop powerful warhorses. The color palette leans towards the red and blue of the Union Jack, with the English soldiers featuring red accents and the French knights displaying blues and golds. A central symbolic element is a broken fleur-de-lis banner lying trampled on the ground near the English lines, signifying defeat. The composition emphasizes the tension and chaos of battle, with dust and smoke rising from the ground, but avoids any graphic violence. The overall feeling is one of historical significance and the long-standing, often turbulent, relationship between the two nations. The sky above is a mix of light blues and greys, hinting at an approaching storm, reflecting the stormy history. The image ratio is 16:9, and the main subject is in the center of the image.
