A watercolour painting in a realistic style, depicting a divided island. The island is lush green, representing Ireland, bisected vertically by a jagged, rocky fault line running from north to south. On the western side of the fault line, the green is a vibrant, unified emerald, symbolizing a united Ireland. Rolling hills dotted with traditional Irish cottages and Celtic crosses are visible. On the eastern side of the fault line, the green is fractured and interspersed with patches of grey, representing the division and conflict. Scattered across this side are stylized symbols of British influence, such as a miniature Union Jack flag subtly integrated into the landscape, and architectural elements reminiscent of Northern Ireland. The sky above the island is a mix of turbulent grey clouds on the eastern side and patches of clear blue on the western side, reflecting the contrasting atmospheres. The sea surrounding the island is a deep blue, with subtle whitecaps hinting at underlying tensions. The overall colour palette should lean towards pastel shades, with the greens and blues reminiscent of the UK flag. The composition should focus on the stark contrast between the two sides of the island, emphasizing the central theme of division and disagreement over unification, with the rocky fault line as the focal point. The style should be detailed and realistic, avoiding cartoonish elements, to convey the seriousness of the historical conflict.
