A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting the interior of a cozy British living room during Christmas. The scene is warm and inviting, bathed in a soft, diffused light. A centrally positioned, richly decorated Christmas tree, adorned with twinkling warm white fairy lights and a variety of colorful ornaments in pastel colors (red, blue, green, yellow), stands as the focal point. Beneath the tree, wrapped presents with ribbons, primarily in red, white, and blue, are scattered. A traditional fireplace, made of brick, is decorated with a garland of holly and ivy, interspersed with red berries and pine cones. Above the fireplace, a framed landscape painting hangs on the wall. Two comfortable armchairs, upholstered in a muted tartan pattern, face the fireplace. A small, round wooden table sits between them, holding a steaming mug of tea and a plate of mince pies. In the background, a window shows a snowy scene outside, with gently falling snowflakes. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades, with accents of red, white, and blue, mirroring the UK flag subtly. The composition should evoke a sense of warmth, tradition, and festive cheer, emphasizing the custom of decorating homes during Christmas in the UK. The image should be in 16:9 landscape format.
