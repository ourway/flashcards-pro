A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format illustrating the funding sources of local councils in the UK. The central focus is a sturdy, classical-style building representing a local council, rendered in pastel grey stone. The building is flanked by two prominent supporting pillars. The left pillar, bathed in soft blue hues reminiscent of the UK flag, symbolizes funding from central government; subtle details like a miniature crown emblem subtly etched into the pillar reinforce this. The right pillar is colored in gentle red tones, also inspired by the UK flag, and adorned with embossed pound (Â£) symbols to represent local taxes. Light streams down from above, illuminating both pillars equally, emphasizing their shared importance in supporting the council building. The background features a quintessential British landscape: rolling green hills dotted with quaint cottages, all rendered in soft pastel shades. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and greens, creating a calming and educational visual. The composition is balanced, with the council building and its supporting pillars taking center stage, ensuring the eye is drawn to the core concept. The artistic style evokes a sense of history and tradition, suitable for educational content.
