A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic style, rendered in a pastel color palette. The image, in a 16:9 landscape format, depicts a split scene, bisected vertically down the center. On the left side, illustrate a moonlit forest clearing, reminiscent of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Fairies with delicate, translucent wings dance in a circle around a sleeping Bottom, who has been transformed with a donkey's head. The forest floor is covered in glowing mushrooms and wildflowers, and the trees have faces carved into their trunks, hinting at the magical and whimsical nature of the play. On the right side, depict a balcony scene evoking Romeo and Juliet. Juliet stands on a stone balcony, gazing longingly upwards, while Romeo is partially visible in the garden below, bathed in soft moonlight. A single red rose lies discarded on the balcony floor, symbolizing their tragic love. The architecture is distinctly Renaissance, with stone arches and intricate carvings. Above the dividing line, a quill pen floats horizontally, subtly connecting both scenes as originating from the same source. The overall mood should be romantic and ethereal, with soft lighting and gentle gradients, capturing the essence of both Shakespearean plays without using any text.
