A sprawling, ancient oak tree stands majestically in a lush, green field under a pastel blue sky. The tree's trunk is thick and strong, painted in earthy browns and light greys. Arising from the main trunk are four distinct, large branches, each representing a devolved administration. These branches are spaced evenly and reach outwards, each bearing vibrant green leaves. Underneath each of these main branches, nestled close to the trunk, are intricate, hand-drawn illustrations of supportive structures. Beneath the first branch (representing Scotland), a meticulously drawn stone foundation is visible. Under the second branch (representing Wales), there's a network of interwoven wooden supports. The third branch (representing Northern Ireland) rests upon a framework of carefully arranged, light grey bricks. The final branch (representing England) is supported by a foundation of solid, dark grey concrete. Small, stylized depictions of people in period clothing (representing the 'civil service') are shown tending to the supportive structures under each branch, watering the foundations and ensuring their stability. The overall color palette is soft and pastel, with blues, greens, browns, and greys dominating. The style is reminiscent of a detailed botanical illustration, hand-drawn with fine lines and delicate shading. The composition emphasizes the interconnectedness of the tree while highlighting the distinct support systems that each branch requires to flourish, visually representing the independent civil services of each devolved administration.
