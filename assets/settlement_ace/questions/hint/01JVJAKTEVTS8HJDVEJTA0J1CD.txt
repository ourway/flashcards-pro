A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical watercolor paintings. The composition centers on a stylized, symbolic battlefield representing Agincourt, depicted with a soft, pastel color palette dominated by blues, reds, and creams, echoing the colors of the UK flag. The central focus is a stylized, long winding river in the middle of the image, representing the passage of time and the "hundreds of years." Positioned symmetrically on either side of the river, are two opposing stylized armies, each distinguished by their banners and uniforms, engaged in a dynamic, yet frozen moment of combat. One army bears emblems suggesting English heraldry (stylized lions and fleur-de-lis), while the other displays symbols of France (eagles and lilies), but the symbols should be unrecognisable without the user knowing what they are. The background fades into a misty, soft-focused landscape with hints of rolling hills and a pale, clouded sky. Above the scene, a stylized banner stretches across the sky, subtly suggesting a timeline, with the battlefield positioned at its center. The overall impression is one of historical significance and the passage of time, emphasizing Agincourt's central role within the extended period of the Hundred Years War. The image should evoke a sense of importance and historical weight, prompting the viewer to associate the battle with its broader context.
