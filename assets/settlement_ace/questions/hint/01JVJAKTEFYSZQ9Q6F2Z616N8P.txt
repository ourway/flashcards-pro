A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9, depicting a scene from early 20th century London, centered on three determined women marching in a Suffragette rally. The color palette leans towards the Suffragette colors: purple, white, and green, with subtle pastel variations. The central figure, an elegant woman with a determined expression, wears a long purple coat with a white sash emblazoned with a green emblem. She holds a banner aloft with the colors of purple, white, and green. The other two women, flanking her, wear similar attire, one in white and the other in green. They are marching past the Houses of Parliament, subtly rendered in the background with a light blue sky. The overall atmosphere is one of resolute determination and peaceful protest. The architecture, clothing, and overall aesthetic should reflect the Edwardian era. The composition should guide the eye towards the central woman and her banner, emphasizing the Suffragette movement's strong will. The edges of the image are subtly blurred to create a soft, memory-like effect. The image should evoke a sense of historical importance and the struggle for women's rights.
