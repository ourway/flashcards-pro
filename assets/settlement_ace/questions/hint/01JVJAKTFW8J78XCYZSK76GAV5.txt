A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting two distinct figures representing "Tilda" and "Colin" accepting awards. The artwork should utilise a pastel colour palette, with subtle hints of red, white, and blue reflecting the UK flag. "Tilda" is portrayed with her characteristic androgynous features and short blonde hair, elegantly dressed in a flowing gown. "Colin" is depicted in a classic tuxedo, embodying quintessential British charm and sophistication. Both figures are positioned on a stylized stage, bathed in warm, golden spotlight. The background features a subtle, blurred rendering of a grand theatre interior, suggesting a prestigious awards ceremony in the UK. The awards they hold are gleaming and stylized, reflecting the light, and serving as symbolic representations of their celebrated status. The composition should be balanced, drawing the viewer's eye to the central figures while maintaining a sense of depth and realism. The overall atmosphere should evoke a sense of accomplishment, elegance, and British cinematic excellence. The image ratio should be 16:9 landscape orientation.
