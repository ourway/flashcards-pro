A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the interior of the House of Lords. The color palette leans heavily on pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The central focus is on a group of Lords in their traditional red robes, seated in plush, ornate chairs. Light filters through a stained-glass window above, casting a soft glow on the scene. The window depicts a historical scene of the Magna Carta being signed. In the foreground, slightly blurred, is a single, outstretched hand holding a ballot paper, reaching towards the Lords, but the paper is just out of reach. The hand represents "the people". Symbolic elements include the Mace of the House of Lords prominently displayed on a table, signifying authority, and a subtle mist or fog effect in the background to suggest the unelected nature of the peers. The composition should convey a sense of tradition and formality, but with a slight, almost melancholic tone, emphasizing the disconnect between the public and the selection process of the Lords. The scene should feel grand and historical, yet also subtly highlight the lack of direct public election. The overall mood should be educational, informative, and a little bit mysterious.
