A hand-drawn, realistic, 2D watercolour image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a vibrant and bustling village fete in the English countryside. The central focus is on a whimsical, slightly uneven race track, marked with red and white striped tape, snaking through the green. Dominating the center of the image are four runners, each representing a political party. The runner closest to the finish line, slightly ahead of the others, is wearing a blue jersey. The second runner is in red, the third in yellow, and the last in green. Cheering spectators line the track, waving small Union Jack flags and holding colourful balloons in pastel shades of red, white, and blue. A classic British village backdrop consisting of thatched-roof cottages, a quaint church spire, and rolling hills fades into the background. The overall atmosphere is celebratory and lighthearted. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades, with prominent use of reds, whites, and blues reminiscent of the UK flag. The style is reminiscent of classic children's book illustrations, aiming for a visually appealing and memorable representation of the "first past the post" system. The image should evoke a sense of friendly competition and community spirit, emphasizing the simplicity of the electoral system.
