A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a symbolic representation of the Battle of Bosworth Field and the year 1485. The scene is set on a rolling green field under a cloudy sky, reminiscent of the English countryside. In the center, a fallen crown, intricately designed and reflecting light, lies amidst scattered red and white roses (representing the Houses of Lancaster and York, respectively). Emerging from the roses, four prominent swords point upwards, their hilts adorned with subtle emblems: a fleur-de-lis, a thistle, a shamrock, and a Tudor rose, symbolizing the future union of the kingdoms. To the right of the crown, a stylized hourglass lies on its side, with sand subtly shaped like the number '8' trickling out, hinting at the 'full age' clue. Five scattered coins, each bearing a faint image of a Tudor rose, are dispersed around the hourglass. The color palette leans heavily on pastel variations of red, white, and blue, echoing the colors of the UK flag, with the green field providing a grounding contrast. The overall composition is designed to be visually harmonious and memorable, creating a strong association between the imagery and the year 1485, while avoiding any text or numbers directly within the image. The art style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and solemnity.
