A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a split composition representing the two main political groups in the early 18th-century Parliament: the Tories and the Whigs. On the left side, representing the Tories, depict a robust, earth-toned oak tree, its roots deeply embedded in the soil. At the base of the tree, include subtle imagery of countryside estates and landowners, hinting at the Tory's traditional support base. The oak tree is a symbol of English heritage and tradition. On the right side, representing the Whigs, illustrate a merchant ship sailing on a calm sea. The ship should have prominent sails and be laden with goods, subtly suggesting trade and commerce. The sky above is divided, with a slightly overcast, muted sky above the oak tree, transitioning to a brighter, more open sky above the ship. The colour palette should primarily consist of pastel shades with hints of red, white, and blue, mirroring the colours of the UK flag. The overall aesthetic should evoke a sense of history and the contrasting ideologies of these two political groups. The image should be detailed enough to be visually engaging but not overly cluttered, allowing the symbolic elements to stand out.
