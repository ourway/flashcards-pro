A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a symbolic representation of the United Kingdom's linguistic diversity. At the heart of the image, a stylized, interconnected Celtic knot, rendered in the pastel shades of blue and white. Emerging from this knot are three distinct, yet intertwined, stylized floral emblems: a daffodil (representing Wales), a thistle (representing Scotland), and a shamrock (representing Northern Ireland). Each flower should appear vibrant and realistically drawn, with intricate details highlighting the unique characteristics of each plant. Subtle, flowing lines emanating from each flower gently merge into the central Celtic knot, symbolizing the interconnectedness of these cultures within the UK. The background is a soft, blended wash of pastel colors reminiscent of a misty landscape, evoking the natural beauty of the UK. The overall composition should convey a sense of unity, heritage, and the vibrant presence of these languages within the United Kingdom. The image should not contain any text or numbers.
