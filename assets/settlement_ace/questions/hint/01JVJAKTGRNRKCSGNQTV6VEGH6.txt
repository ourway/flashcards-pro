A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting depicting a Diwali night scene. The artwork should be in a realistic style, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements. The composition is centered around a traditional Indian home, glowing warmly from within, with multiple windows showcasing lit diyas (oil lamps). The color palette should lean towards warm pastel shades, punctuated by the bright reds, blues, and whites reminiscent of the UK flag, subtly integrated into the decorations and clothing of the figures. In the foreground, a family of four – grandparents, parents, and a child – are depicted lighting fireworks and sparklers, their faces illuminated by the dazzling light. The night sky above is filled with a cascade of colorful fireworks, each burst meticulously rendered with intricate details. The overall atmosphere is one of joyous celebration and radiant light. The subtle integration of UK flag colors should be harmonious and not overtly patriotic, simply influencing the color choices within the traditional Diwali setting. The painting should evoke a sense of warmth, cultural richness, and the illuminating spirit of the "Festival of Lights." The style should resemble classic storybook illustrations, focusing on detail and realism while maintaining a gentle, inviting aesthetic.
