A watercolour painting in a realistic style, depicting a serene English countryside scene. The composition is centered on a blooming meadow filled with pastel-colored spring flowers, primarily daffodils and primroses. In the foreground, a winding path leads towards a quaint village church with a moss-covered stone tower. Three prominent blossoming trees are strategically placed along the path, symbolizing the "three weeks." Each tree is adorned with delicate pink and white blossoms, suggesting the fragility and beauty of spring. Nestled at the base of each tree are small, hand-painted Easter eggs, subtly hinting at the upcoming Easter celebration. Above the meadow, the sky transitions from a soft, pale blue to a warm, golden hue near the horizon, evoking a sense of dawn and new beginnings. A gentle stream meanders through the meadow, reflecting the sky's pastel colors. The overall color palette should lean towards soft pastels, punctuated by the vibrant yellows of the daffodils and the lush greens of the meadow, reminiscent of the UK flag's colours. The painting style should be detailed and realistic, capturing the textures of the flowers, the bark of the trees, and the stonework of the church. The entire scene is intended to evoke a feeling of peace, tranquility, and the anticipation of spring, visually linking Mothering Sunday to the period three weeks before Easter.
