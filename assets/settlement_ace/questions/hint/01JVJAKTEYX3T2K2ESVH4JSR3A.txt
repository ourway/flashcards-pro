A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style (not cartoonish or abstract) depicting Queen Elizabeth II in her later years, rendered with a gentle and respectful expression. She is adorned not with a traditional jeweled crown, but with a delicate and elaborate crown crafted from intertwined leaves and flowers representing the diverse flora of the Commonwealth nations. Each leaf and flower should be identifiable and subtly representative of different Commonwealth countries. The colors should be primarily pastel, with soft greens, blues, and yellows dominating the floral crown. The Queen is dressed in a simple, elegant pastel blue dress, devoid of any overtly regal or political symbols. She is positioned centrally within the 16:9 frame. Behind her, a soft-focus background depicts a gathering of people from various ethnic backgrounds, dressed in their traditional attire, symbolizing the unity and diversity of the Commonwealth. The overall composition should convey a sense of peace, unity, and symbolic leadership, devoid of any implication of political power. The lighting is soft and diffused, highlighting the Queen's face and the intricate details of the floral crown. The artwork should evoke a sense of historical significance and cultural richness, emphasizing the symbolic role of the monarch within the Commonwealth. There should be no text or numbers anywhere in the image.
