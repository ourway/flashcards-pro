A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting the interior of the Royal Albert Hall during a performance of The Proms. The color palette should be primarily pastel blues, pale reds, and creams, evoking a sense of classic British elegance and the UK flag. The central focus is on a full symphony orchestra, resplendent with various instruments – violins, cellos, trumpets, flutes, and percussion – all bathed in the warm glow of stage lighting. The conductor, a figure of poised authority, stands on a podium, baton raised, leading the ensemble. The hall itself is rendered with careful attention to its architectural details: the ornate balconies, the intricate ceiling design, and the tiered seating filled with a diverse audience, their faces reflecting rapt attention and enjoyment. The composition emphasizes depth and perspective, drawing the viewer into the heart of the musical experience. Soft, diffused lighting creates a sense of atmosphere and grandeur. The overall style should be realistic, capturing the textures of the instruments, the fabrics of the clothing, and the architectural details of the hall, while maintaining a light and airy watercolor aesthetic. Symbolically, the image represents the rich cultural heritage of orchestral classical music in the UK and its prominent role during The Proms.
