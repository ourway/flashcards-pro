A vibrant, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a watercolor painting, depicting a lively St. Patrick's Day celebration spanning across a geographical representation of Ireland. The island is divided horizontally, with the upper portion subtly representing Northern Ireland and the lower portion representing the Republic of Ireland, though the division is seamless and harmonious. The scene is filled with joyful revelers dressed in green, some wearing traditional Irish attire, participating in a parade. Shamrocks are abundant, adorning clothing, floats, and even subtly forming patterns in the landscape. A traditional Irish band plays lively music, with visible instruments like fiddles and bodhr√°ns. The color palette is predominantly green, with accents of white and orange to subtly echo the Irish flag, interspersed with pastel shades of blue and pink in the clothing and background. Rolling green hills and quaint villages dot the landscape, unified by the shared celebration. The sky is a soft, pastel blue with fluffy white clouds. The composition should focus on the unified celebration across the entire island, emphasizing the shared cultural significance of St. Patrick's Day in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The overall tone should be festive, joyful, and inclusive, capturing the spirit of the holiday.
