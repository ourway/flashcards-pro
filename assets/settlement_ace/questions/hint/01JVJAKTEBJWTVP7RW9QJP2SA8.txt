A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a vast, sun-drenched South African savanna. In the foreground, a small group of wild boars (warthogs) with prominent tusks are depicted foraging amongst the dry grasses and scattered acacia trees. The boars are rendered with realistic textures and coloring, predominantly earthy browns and grays. The savanna stretches into the distance, with rolling hills and rocky outcrops fading into a hazy blue horizon. In the middle distance, a silhouette of a traditional South African kraal (village) can be subtly seen, made of round thatched huts. The overall color palette should evoke the warmth and aridity of the South African landscape, utilizing muted yellows, oranges, and browns, with hints of blue in the sky. The sun should be depicted as a warm, golden orb, casting long shadows across the savanna. The sky should be a gradient of pale blue to light orange near the horizon. The style of the painting should be reminiscent of classic wildlife illustrations, with a focus on detail and realism. The composition should draw the eye to the boars in the foreground, emphasizing their presence within the South African landscape.
