A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image depicting a serene yet poignant Remembrance Day scene. The central focus is a stylized, oversized poppy, rendered in vibrant red with a black center, its petals gently unfurling. Behind the poppy, stretching across the 16:9 landscape, is a field of countless smaller poppies, fading into a soft-focus background. Rising subtly from the poppy field are faint, ghost-like figures of soldiers from World War I, their silhouettes suggesting a solemn procession. In the upper-right quadrant, a vintage clock tower is illustrated, its hands frozen at 11:00 AM. The clock face is slightly obscured by a wisp of mist, adding a touch of ethereal quality. Below the clock tower, subtly embedded within the poppy field, are Roman numerals: 'MCMXVIII' (1918), illustrated in an elegant, slightly aged font and a muted grey tone, which is partially covered with the poppies. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of red, grey, and beige, with subtle hints of blue in the misty background, evoking a sense of peace and remembrance. The art style should be realistic, aiming for a balance between historical accuracy and artistic interpretation, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements. The composition emphasizes depth and perspective, drawing the viewer's eye towards the central poppy and the clock tower, while the Roman numerals serve as a subtle reminder of the correct year â€“ 1918.
