A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style (not cartoonish or abstract), depicting the Houses of Parliament in London under a pastel sky. The Palace of Westminster is rendered with precision, showcasing its neo-Gothic architecture, including the iconic Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben). The color palette should be pastel shades of blue, red, and white, subtly echoing the Union Jack. In the foreground, but still within the central frame (16:9 ratio), a civil servant, depicted as a kindly-faced, middle-aged person wearing a neatly pressed suit, is metaphorically "servicing" the Parliament building. This "servicing" is visualized as the civil servant gently polishing a section of the building with a soft cloth, not literally, but in a way that symbolizes their dedication to maintaining the functionality and integrity of the government. The civil servant is surrounded by papers that represent the work that they do. The sky above the Houses of Parliament is bright and clear. The overall composition should convey a sense of order, responsibility, and the symbiotic relationship between the legislative body (Parliament) and the administrative arm (Civil Service) of the UK government. The image aims to create a memorable visual link between the two entities and their roles.
