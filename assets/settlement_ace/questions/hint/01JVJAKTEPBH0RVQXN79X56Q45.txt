A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, showcasing a historical scene. The central focus is a vibrant red Welsh Dragon, depicted with a slightly forlorn expression, looking towards the Union Flag. The Union Flag, positioned to the right of the dragon but slightly further back in the scene to give the dragon prominence, is depicted in its classic red, white, and blue hues, waving gently. The background features a rolling, green Welsh landscape with a small, stone castle perched atop a distant hill. The dragon is rendered with intricate detail â€“ scales, claws, and facial features are all clearly defined. A scroll lies at the dragon's feet, seemingly discarded, with the date "1606" subtly visible as if it was written with ink that has faded over time. The colour palette leans towards pastel shades, with the red of the dragon and the flag providing bold contrast against the softer greens and blues of the landscape and sky. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of historical context and the dragon's missed opportunity, emphasizing the symbolic absence of Welsh representation on the Union Flag due to the earlier unification. A shaft of light from the top left corner illuminates the dragon, creating a dramatic effect.
