A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a balanced scale against a backdrop suggestive of modern Britain. On one side of the scale, arrange a diverse group of women representing various professions: a doctor in scrubs, a businesswoman in a suit, an engineer with a hard hat, a teacher holding books, and an artist with a paintbrush. The women should be depicted in pastel colors, mainly pink and light blue. On the other side of the scale, feature a similar diverse group of men in corresponding professions, also in pastel colors, mainly blue and beige. The scale should be perfectly balanced, symbolizing the near-equal representation of women in the British workforce. The background should include subtle, stylized silhouettes of iconic British landmarks, such as the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye, rendered in soft, muted blues and grays. The overall color palette should evoke a sense of harmony and equality, predominantly using pastel shades reminiscent of the UK flag's colors. The composition should emphasize the balance and diversity, with each figure rendered with attention to detail to convey their individual roles and contributions to the workforce. The artwork should be visually appealing and informative, designed to create a memorable visual association with the concept of gender equality in the British workforce.
