A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a runner, Sir Roger Bannister, captured mid-stride in a dynamic running pose on a classic, red-brick running track. He wears a vintage-style white running vest with the British emblem subtly stitched on the chest and navy blue shorts. The runner should be depicted with a determined expression, sweat glistening on his brow, conveying the effort of breaking a record. Positioned slightly behind him is an ethereal, translucent stopwatch, its hands frozen just before the four-minute mark. The background features a blurred crowd of spectators in the stands, rendered in soft pastel colors (primarily blues, whites, and subtle reds) to evoke a sense of the historical atmosphere. The sky above is light blue with fluffy white clouds. In the bottom left corner, subtly incorporate a stylized depiction of Oxford University's iconic architecture, representing where Bannister achieved his feat. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel hues with occasional vibrant pops of color to draw the eye to key elements like the runner and the stopwatch. The style should be reminiscent of vintage sports posters, emphasizing the historical significance of the event.
