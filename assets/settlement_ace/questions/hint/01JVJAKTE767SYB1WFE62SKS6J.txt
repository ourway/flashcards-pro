A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a quintessential British allotment on a sunny afternoon. The image is in 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a neatly divided allotment plot, bursting with rows of colourful vegetables and fruits. Red tomatoes climb up trellises, green cabbages sit plump in the soil, yellow courgettes sprawl across the ground, and purple aubergines hang heavy on their stems. A scarecrow, dressed in a tweed jacket and flat cap, stands guard in the middle of the plot, its straw arms outstretched. A watering can, painted in pastel blue, rests near a patch of carrots. In the background, a traditional brick wall marks the boundary of the allotment, with climbing roses in full bloom. Beyond the wall, a glimpse of rolling green hills evokes the British countryside. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel shades with splashes of red, white, and blue subtly interwoven to represent the UK flag. A soft, diffused light bathes the scene, creating a sense of peace and abundance. The composition is balanced, with the allotment plot as the clear focal point, drawing the viewer's eye to the variety of fruits and vegetables being cultivated. The style should emulate classic watercolour illustrations found in gardening books, emphasizing detail and realism.
