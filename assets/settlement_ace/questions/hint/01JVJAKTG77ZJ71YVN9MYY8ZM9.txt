A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a depiction of the Elizabeth Tower (formerly known as Big Ben) bathed in the soft, warm light of a late afternoon sun. At the base of the tower, partially obscured by a gentle mist, stands a regal figure representing Queen Elizabeth II. She is depicted in her later years, wearing a simple, elegant dress and a modest crown, gazing upwards with a serene expression. A faint, ghostly silhouette of Queen Elizabeth I is subtly placed in the background, appearing almost translucent and fading into the sky, positioned slightly to the side and further away from the tower. This reinforces the idea that the tower's renaming was in honor of Elizabeth II, not Elizabeth I. The color palette should predominantly feature pastel blues and reds, reminiscent of the UK flag, with accents of gold to highlight the regal elements. The overall composition should evoke a sense of history, legacy, and the passage of time, subtly emphasizing the distinction between the two queens and the correct association with the tower's renaming. A subtle, stylized Tudor rose (symbol of the Tudor dynasty, associated with Elizabeth I) is depicted falling gently from the top of the frame, its petals scattering and fading as they descend, further reinforcing that the honor does not belong to her. The background includes a subtly blurred depiction of the Houses of Parliament, rendered in soft, muted tones, to provide context without distracting from the primary subjects.
