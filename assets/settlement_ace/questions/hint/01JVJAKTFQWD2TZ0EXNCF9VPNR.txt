A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a formal meeting room bathed in soft, pastel light. Dominating the center of the 16:9 composition is a sturdy, oak table around which are seated several figures. The central figure, a Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC), is identifiable by their confident posture and a small, symbolic badge depicting scales of justice interwoven with a stylized British police helmet. The PCC is extending a hand towards a newly appointed Chief Constable, depicted in full uniform, standing respectfully before the table. Behind the Chief Constable are subtle, blurred figures representing the local community, observing the proceedings. The backdrop includes a framed portrait of Queen Elizabeth II and a subtle Union Jack flag draped discreetly in the corner, adding a touch of British heritage. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, reminiscent of the UK flag's colors, creating a calm and authoritative atmosphere. The room is meticulously detailed, featuring elements like leather-bound books on shelves, adding depth and texture. The composition should subtly emphasize the PCC's central role in the appointment process, creating a memorable visual association for the test taker.
