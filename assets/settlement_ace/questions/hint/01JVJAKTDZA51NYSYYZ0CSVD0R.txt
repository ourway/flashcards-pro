A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting the coastline of ancient Britain. The color palette should lean heavily on pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack. Dominating the central composition is a sturdy oak tree, its roots intertwined with Celtic knotwork designs. At the base of the tree, a small, weathered Roman sundial is partially overgrown with ivy, symbolizing the passage of time. The sundial's gnomon casts a shadow that points towards a faint, distant Roman galley on the horizon. The overall scene is peaceful and serene, emphasizing the long period of isolation. Wisps of mist rise from the sea, adding to the atmosphere of historical distance and mystery. The sky transitions from a pale dawn on the left to a slightly brighter, sunlit area on the right, visually representing the beginning of a new era. The illustration should evoke a sense of calm anticipation and the slow, inevitable march of history. The style should be reminiscent of classic historical illustrations, with careful attention to detail in the depiction of the landscape, flora, and the Roman artifact.
