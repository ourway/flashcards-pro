A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolour image in a realistic style (not cartoonish or abstract), ratio 16:9, depicting a classic British car, such as a vintage Mini Cooper, parked on a quintessential British street lined with terraced houses. The car is bathed in soft, pastel-toned sunlight. Focus should be on the car and the surrounding area should be slightly blurred. A large, stylized "MOT" sticker, designed as a circular emblem with a gear motif at its center, is subtly visible on the car's windscreen, resembling a health certificate badge. A pastel-coloured safety net, light blue in colour, is gently draped over the car, symbolizing car insurance as a safety net. The safety net is not obstructing the view of the car but subtly implies protection. The colour palette should be predominantly pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the colours of the UK flag. A blurred background of a traditional British street scene with red brick houses and neatly manicured gardens enhances the sense of place. The composition should be balanced, with the car as the central focus, and the MOT sticker and safety net acting as symbolic visual cues relating to the question. The overall mood should be calm, reassuring, and educational.
