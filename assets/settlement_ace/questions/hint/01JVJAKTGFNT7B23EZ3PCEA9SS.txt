A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a traditional British Christmas dinner. The composition is centered on a large, mahogany dining table covered with a crisp white linen tablecloth. Dominating the table is a golden-brown roast turkey, presented on a large, ornate silver platter. Beside the turkey, there's a steaming Christmas pudding, dark brown in color, adorned with a sprig of holly and drizzled with white custard. Surrounding the main dishes are side dishes in pastel colors: bowls of cranberry sauce (deep red), roasted parsnips (creamy white), and Brussels sprouts (light green). Silver cutlery and crystal glasses are neatly arranged around decorative pastel blue plates. In the background, a warm, inviting fireplace with a mantelpiece decorated with red and white stockings and green garlands is visible. The color palette should lean towards the colors of the UK flag: reds, whites, and blues, subtly incorporated into the various elements of the scene. The overall atmosphere should be festive, warm, and inviting, evoking the feeling of a traditional British Christmas celebration. The lighting should be soft and diffused, highlighting the textures and details of each element.
