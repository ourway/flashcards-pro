A watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic British storybook art, depicting a car driving on a winding country road in the UK. The car is light blue, reminiscent of the blue in the Union Jack. The car is partially covered by a cracked and broken shield, symbolizing insurance. Emanating from behind the broken shield are red and white light rays, resembling the colours of the UK flag. On the side of the road, a stern-looking police officer in traditional British uniform is motioning the car to stop. The background features rolling green hills, typical of the British countryside, with a hazy sky in pastel shades of blue and grey. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel blues, greens, and reds, echoing the colors of the UK flag but in softer tones. The overall composition should be balanced, with the car and police officer positioned centrally, and the broken shield serving as a focal point. The art style should feel gentle and informative, avoiding anything overly dramatic, and be suitable for educational purposes. The image should evoke a sense of mild consequence rather than severe punishment, focusing on the broken shield to represent the lack of insurance.
