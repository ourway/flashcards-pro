A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a grand, ornate study bathed in a soft, diffused light. The scene is set within a quintessential 18th-century British manor, with architectural details like tall, arched windows and dark wood paneling. The color palette leans heavily on pastel blues, creams, and reds, subtly echoing the Union Jack. In the center, a distinguished gentleman with powdered wig and period attire sits at a large mahogany desk, illuminated by the warm glow of a single candlestick. He is engrossed in writing, his brow furrowed in concentration. Around him, stacks of books fill the shelves, overflowing with knowledge. Emanating from his head is a radiant, golden light, not harsh but gentle and illuminating, spreading outwards to subtly light the room. This light symbolizes the flourishing of new ideas. The overall composition should convey a sense of intellectual awakening and the transformative power of knowledge during the 18th century, subtly hinting at the Enlightenment period without explicitly depicting any text or numbers. Focus on details that evoke a sense of history, intellect, and enlightenment, making the image both educational and aesthetically pleasing. The image ratio should be 16:9.
