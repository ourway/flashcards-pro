A hand-drawn, realistic, 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a vibrant Diwali celebration. The image ratio is 16:9, and the main focus should be in the center. The scene unfolds in a cozy, traditionally decorated British home during twilight. Large windows reveal a dark blue evening sky dotted with twinkling stars. Inside, a family of South Asian descent, dressed in colorful traditional attire – sarees and kurtas in shades of red, orange, and gold – are gathered around a table. The table is laden with traditional Diwali sweets in pastel colors and small oil lamps (diyas) made of clay. The diyas are lit, casting a warm, inviting, golden glow that illuminates the faces of the family members and reflects off the polished wooden surfaces of the furniture. Strings of marigold flowers and paper lanterns in pastel colors are strung across the room, adding to the festive atmosphere. The overall color palette leans towards warm, pastel shades, with accents of gold and deep blue to evoke a sense of celebration and serenity. The style should avoid any cartoonish or abstract elements, aiming for a realistic and detailed portrayal of the scene. The lighting should be soft and diffused, emphasizing the gentle glow of the diyas as the central element. The composition should be balanced and harmonious, drawing the viewer's eye to the central focal point: the glowing diyas and the joyful family celebrating the Festival of Lights.
