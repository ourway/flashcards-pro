A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a wedding scene with a focus on the bride and groom. The color palette should be pastel, with hints of red and blue to subtly evoke the UK flag. The bride, on the left side of the image, is wearing a traditional white wedding dress with delicate floral embroidery. Her expression is joyful and confident as she looks towards the groom. The groom, on the right side, is dressed in a classic dark blue suit, with a matching tie and a boutonniere featuring a red rose. He is looking at the bride with a loving and equally confident expression. Their hands are gently clasped together. The background features a soft, blurred depiction of a traditional British countryside church, with light filtering through stained-glass windows. Above the couple, two doves are flying upwards, intertwined in a heart shape. The overall composition should emphasize the equality and mutual affection between the bride and groom, symbolizing the "both people involved" aspect of the answer. The art style should aim for a timeless and romantic feel, emphasizing the importance of free consent in marriage.
