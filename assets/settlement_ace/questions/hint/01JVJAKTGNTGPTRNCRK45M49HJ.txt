A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a pivotal scene from the Suffragette movement. The artwork, presented in a 16:9 landscape ratio, centers around a group of determined women marching in a London street. Predominantly use a pastel color palette, interspersed with red, white, and blue accents reminiscent of the UK flag. The women are dressed in early 20th-century attire, complete with hats and long skirts, holding banners advocating for women's right to vote. The banners are blank, devoid of text, focusing instead on the visual impact of their collective demonstration. In the background, iconic London landmarks such as the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben are softly rendered in the background, subtly grounding the scene in its historical context. The overall mood is one of quiet determination and unwavering resolve. The composition emphasizes the unity and strength of the women, their faces etched with determination, hinting at the suffering and struggle endured before achieving their rights. The sky should be overcast, casting a soft, diffused light that underscores the seriousness of their cause. The image should evoke a sense of historical weight and the importance of the Suffragettes' contribution to women's rights.
