A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting four distinct football stadiums, each representing a different country within the UK. The stadiums are arranged in a horizontal row, taking up the central portion of the 16:9 frame. Each stadium should be identifiable by subtle architectural details and flags subtly incorporated into the stands or as banners fluttering gently in the wind. The first stadium, representing England, features white and red accents with a stylized St. George's Cross flag. The second, for Scotland, incorporates blue and white hues with a Saltire flag. The third, for Wales, showcases red and green with a stylized Welsh Dragon flag. The final stadium, representing Northern Ireland, features green and white accents with a stylized St. Patrick's Cross flag. Each stadium is filled with cheering fans, depicted as blurred, indistinct figures to maintain focus on the stadiums themselves. Above the stadiums, four stylized footballs arc gracefully, each trailing colored smoke corresponding to the colors of the respective national flags: red and white for England, blue and white for Scotland, red and green for Wales, and green and white for Northern Ireland. The sky is a soft pastel blue, and the overall color palette leans towards the colors of the UK flag, creating a sense of unity while emphasizing the distinct national identities through the individual stadiums and flag details. This image should convey the idea of individual national football teams within the UK competing independently.
