A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical tapestries but rendered in soft pastel colours with hints of red, white, and blue. The composition is centered around a regal King Henry VIII, depicted in his iconic Tudor attire, complete with a jeweled crown and opulent robes. He stands in a grand hall with six distinct archways behind him, each archway framing a different woman in period-appropriate clothing, representing his six wives. The women are not identical; each possesses unique features and attire to subtly hint at their individual stories. In the foreground, a symbolic representation of a fractured Roman column lies broken on the floor, its pieces scattered, symbolizing the break from the Church of Rome. Light streams in from a stained-glass window above, casting a warm, diffused glow on the scene, highlighting the king's figure. The overall atmosphere is one of historical significance and subtle drama, capturing both the marital complexities and the religious upheaval of Henry VIII's reign. The background features subtle architectural details of Tudor England, such as intricate wood paneling and heraldic symbols, all rendered in a soft, watercolour style that evokes a sense of historical authenticity. The colour palette should be dominated by pastel blues, creams, and muted reds, mirroring the colours of the UK flag, while avoiding overly bright or garish tones.
