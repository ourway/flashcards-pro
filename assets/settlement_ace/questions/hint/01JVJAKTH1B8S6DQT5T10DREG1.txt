A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor painting depicting a stylized map of Europe, rendered in a soft, pastel color palette dominated by blues, reds, and whites reminiscent of the Union Jack. The map should emphasize the landmasses and coastlines, using subtle shading to indicate mountains and rivers without specific labels. The United Kingdom is prominently featured in the northwest region of the map. Instead of being geographically accurate, the UK is represented by a large, detailed compass rose inlaid into the island, with the "NW" (North West) quadrant of the compass being significantly brighter and more emphasized with a radiating light effect. Tiny, stylized sheep graze peacefully within the UK boundaries, adding a touch of pastoral charm. The surrounding ocean is depicted with gentle, flowing brushstrokes, suggesting movement and depth. The overall composition is centered, with the UK and its highlighted North West compass quadrant serving as the focal point. The art style leans towards realism while maintaining a whimsical, educational feel, avoiding harsh lines or overly detailed textures. The aspect ratio is 16:9, ensuring a wide, landscape view, perfect for visual learning.
