A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a biplane taking off from a lush, green Irish field under a bright, slightly overcast sky. The biplane is painted in pastel shades of blue and white, subtly echoing the colours of the UK flag. Its wings are long and elegant. The field below is divided by a slightly winding, dry-stone wall, that visually splits the field into two distinct sections, symbolizing the partitioning of Ireland. On one side of the wall, the field is dotted with traditional Irish cottages with smoking chimneys, while on the other side, the landscape subtly transitions to reflect a more industrial aesthetic, with hints of factories in the distant background. The sky above the biplane is subtly divided by a barely visible line, representing the new boundary. The overall colour palette is soft and pastel, creating a serene and memorable image. The composition is centered around the biplane, with the divided field and sky serving as symbolic background elements. The biplane is depicted at the exact moment of take-off, with its wheels just leaving the ground, conveying a sense of new beginnings and division. The style aims for a blend of historical accuracy and artistic interpretation, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements.
