A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor image in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant, fertile landscape representing South-East Europe, circa 6000 BC. The scene is bathed in the warm, golden light of the rising sun, with rolling hills adorned with nascent wheat fields in shades of pale yellow and green. In the foreground, a small, early farming village is nestled beside a clear, winding river, reflecting the sky in a pale blue hue. The village consists of simple, thatched-roof dwellings made of wattle and daub, with smoke gently curling from cooking fires. Several villagers, dressed in simple, earth-toned clothing, are depicted engaging in early farming activities: tilling the soil with primitive tools made of wood and stone, planting seeds, and tending to small flocks of sheep and goats. The landscape transitions into more rugged, mountainous terrain in the background, with snow-capped peaks suggesting the Balkan Mountains. The overall color palette emphasizes soft, pastel tones, with hints of the UK flag colors subtly incorporated: the blue river, patches of red poppies interspersed within the wheat fields, and white snow on the mountain peaks. The composition is centered on the village, drawing the viewer's eye to the origin point of early farming practices, symbolizing the migration of agricultural knowledge westward towards Britain. The sky is a gradient of soft pinks and blues, evoking a sense of dawn and new beginnings.
