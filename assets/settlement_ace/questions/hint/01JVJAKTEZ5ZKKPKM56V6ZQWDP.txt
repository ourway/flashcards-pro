A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a stylized, yet realistically rendered haggis, presented on a decorative, silver platter. The haggis should appear plump and savory, its outer casing a natural, earthy brown. Delicate wisps of steam curl upwards, suggesting it has just been served. Surrounding the haggis on the platter are sprigs of fresh rosemary and thyme, adding a touch of visual appeal and hinting at the dish's savory flavors. The platter rests on a tartan tablecloth, predominantly in shades of deep blue, forest green, and crimson red, echoing the Scottish flag. In the background, slightly blurred to maintain focus on the haggis, are hints of a traditional Scottish celebration: a bagpiper in full regalia, rendered in soft pastel colors, stands to the left, and a glimpse of a stone fireplace with a flickering fire can be seen on the right. The overall color palette should be warm and inviting, utilizing pastel variations of the UK flag's colors to evoke a sense of Scottish heritage and culinary tradition. The style is realistic but with a painterly touch, emphasizing textures and light to create a visually appealing and memorable image.
