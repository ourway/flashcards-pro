A vibrant, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a cozy Welsh kitchen scene. The focal point is a cast-iron griddle placed on a rustic wooden stove, with several golden-brown Welsh cakes cooking upon it. These cakes are round and slightly speckled, exhibiting a warm, inviting texture. A gentle wisp of steam rises from the griddle, hinting at the cakes' freshly baked warmth. To the left of the stove, a smiling Welsh Dragon, rendered in pastel red and green, carefully holds a plate piled high with freshly baked Welsh cakes shaped like miniature dragons. The dragon's scales are subtly detailed, and it wears a small, traditional Welsh hat. The kitchen backdrop features whitewashed stone walls adorned with copper pots and pans. A window to the right of the stove reveals a picturesque Welsh landscape with rolling green hills and distant mountains under a soft, blue sky. A traditional Welsh dresser stands against the back wall, displaying blue and white china. The overall colour palette consists of pastel shades with reds, greens, and blues, evoking a sense of warmth, tradition, and the charm of Welsh culture. The composition is carefully balanced to draw the eye towards the Welsh cakes and the dragon, creating a memorable visual link between the food and its Welsh origin.
