A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a serene British countryside scene under a pastel blue sky. Lush green rolling hills stretch into the distance, dotted with quaint cottages with red-tiled roofs. In the foreground, a young boy, dressed in a light blue t-shirt and khaki shorts, stands beside three color-coded recycling bins: blue for paper, green for glass, and red for plastic. He is carefully placing a crumpled newspaper into the blue bin. A gentle breeze rustles the leaves of a mature oak tree to the left, its branches framing the scene. To the right, a robin perches on the green bin, observing the boy's actions. The bins are clearly labeled with universally recognized symbols for recycling, but no text is present. Sunlight bathes the scene, creating soft shadows and highlighting the textures of the grass, brick, and foliage. In the far background, a faint outline of the white cliffs of Dover can be seen, grounding the scene in a specific British context. The overall color palette should be dominated by the pastel blues, greens, and reds of the UK flag, creating a harmonious and visually appealing image that promotes environmental consciousness.
