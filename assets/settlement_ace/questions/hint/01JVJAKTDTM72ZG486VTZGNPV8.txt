A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting Boudicca, the warrior queen, in a dynamic scene. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly reflecting the UK flag. Boudicca stands in the center of the 16:9 frame, her red hair flowing wildly behind her, embodying fierce resistance. She wears simple, Celtic tribal clothing, adorned with subtle woad markings on her face and arms. In her right hand, she grips a spear, angled slightly upwards, symbolizing defiance. Her left hand is raised, palm open, as if rallying her troops. Behind her, a stylized yet realistic British landscape unfolds: rolling green hills dotted with ancient trees, evoking the pre-Roman era. In the distance, faint silhouettes of Roman soldiers and their marching formations are visible, creating a sense of impending conflict. The sky above is a blend of soft blues and creams, suggesting a cloudy, overcast day typical of the British climate. The overall composition is balanced, drawing the eye towards Boudicca as the central figure of resistance against the Roman invasion. The style should evoke historical accuracy while maintaining an artistic and educational feel.
