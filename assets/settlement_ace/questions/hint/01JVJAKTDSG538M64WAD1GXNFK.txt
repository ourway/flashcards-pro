A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, showcasing the Palace of Westminster and Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) bathed in the soft, early morning light. The composition is centered, emphasizing the iconic clock tower and the Houses of Parliament. The color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue and grey, reminiscent of a misty London morning, subtly incorporating the blue from the UK flag. Architectural details of the Palace are rendered with precision, highlighting the intricate Gothic Revival style. The River Thames flows gently in the foreground, reflecting the pastel sky and the grandeur of the buildings. A few stylized, almost translucent, figures in period attire (Victorian or Edwardian) are subtly placed near the palace entrance, suggesting historical significance and the continuous tradition of governance. The overall mood is serene and dignified, evoking a sense of history, stability, and the heart of British democracy. The image should have a 16:9 ratio and should not contain any text.
