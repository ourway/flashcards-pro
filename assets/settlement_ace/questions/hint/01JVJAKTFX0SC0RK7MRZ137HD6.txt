A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Charles II in exile in the Netherlands. The image, in 16:9 landscape format, showcases a regal but weary Charles II, dressed in slightly travel-worn finery with the colour palette resembling the UK flag (red coat, navy blue breeches, white lace collar), standing in a vibrant Dutch landscape. Dominating the background is a classic Dutch windmill with turning sails, set against a clear, blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. Fields of brightly coloured tulips (primarily red, white, and blue to subtly echo the UK flag) stretch towards the horizon. In the middle ground, a painter resembling a Dutch Master (think Rembrandt) is sketching Charles II, capturing his likeness with a quill and parchment. A small, ornate Dutch canal with a traditional barge floats lazily in the foreground. The overall composition should evoke a sense of calm anticipation, with Charles II gazing towards the horizon, hinting at his impending return to England. The use of soft, pastel watercolors should create a light and airy feel, emphasizing the beauty of the Dutch countryside while subtly reminding the viewer of Charles II's temporary refuge before being invited back to England by the Parliament.
