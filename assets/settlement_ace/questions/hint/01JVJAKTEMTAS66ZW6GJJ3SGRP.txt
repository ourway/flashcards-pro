A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a close-up view of a stack of British pound coins (Â£) and banknotes. The coins should be arranged artfully, with some overlapping to showcase their details, such as the Queen's portrait and the various heraldic symbols. The banknotes should be partially visible, revealing their intricate designs and vibrant colors, primarily in hues of red, white, and blue, reminiscent of the UK flag. The background should feature a soft, blurred impression of iconic British landmarks like the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben, rendered in pastel shades to maintain focus on the currency. Light should gently illuminate the coins and notes, creating subtle highlights and shadows to emphasize texture and depth. The overall composition should evoke a sense of stability, history, and the enduring value of the British currency. The image should avoid any text or numbers, instead relying on visual cues to represent "pound sterling," the official currency of the UK. The ratio is 16:9.
