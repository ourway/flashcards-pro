A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a scene that encapsulates the Norman Conquest as the last successful foreign invasion of England. The artwork, in 16:9 landscape format, should feature a central focus on William the Conqueror, depicted as a strong, determined leader in full Norman battle armour, standing triumphantly on English soil. His armour should bear intricate details, reflecting the craftsmanship of the era. Around him, Norman soldiers, also in detailed armour, plant a Norman banner—a golden lion rampant on a red field—firmly into the ground. The background should showcase the iconic white cliffs of Dover, rendered with subtle gradations of white and grey, meeting a turbulent, pastel-blue sea. Scattered around the foreground are broken English shields and swords, symbolizing the defeat of the Anglo-Saxons. The sky above is a mix of stormy greys and patches of hopeful blue, hinting at the monumental shift in English history. The overall color palette should lean towards the colours of the UK flag (red, white, and blue), with the red and gold of the Norman banner providing a striking contrast against the more muted tones of the cliffs and sea. The composition should emphasize the finality of the Norman victory, with William and his banner standing as a lasting symbol of the last successful foreign invasion.
