A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a grand, classical library interior bathed in soft, natural light filtering through arched windows. The library's architecture should evoke the style of the British Library, with towering bookshelves filled with leather-bound volumes. In the foreground, a distinguished researcher with spectacles perches on his nose, is seated at a large wooden desk, illuminated by a desk lamp with a green shade. Heâ€™s deeply engrossed in a sizable, open book with a red bookmark, representing a Hansard report. Emanating from the book, delicate lines of light extend upwards, subtly merging into a stylized representation of a digital cloud, symbolizing the internet. The cloud is subtly integrated into the architectural details of the ceiling, almost like a fresco. The color palette leans towards pastel blues and reds, reminiscent of the Union Jack, subtly woven into the book covers and rug patterns. The composition should be symmetrical, focusing on the central figure and the book as the main subject, with the vast library extending into the background, signifying the extensive availability of the Hansard reports both physically and digitally. The overall tone should be scholarly, serene, and informative, emphasizing the accessibility of parliamentary records.
