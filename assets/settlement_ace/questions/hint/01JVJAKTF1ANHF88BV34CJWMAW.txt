A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, set against a soft, pastel blue sky. The central focus is a portrait of Anne Boleyn, depicted with a kind, intelligent expression. She wears a Tudor-era gown in shades of deep red and gold, with intricate embroidery. Her dark hair is styled in the fashion of the time, adorned with pearls. In the background, gently blurred, is a quintessential English countryside scene: rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep, a quaint village with thatched-roof cottages, and a distant view of a stately English manor house reminiscent of Hever Castle, the Boleyn family home. Framing Anne Boleyn's portrait are delicate, intertwined branches of English roses in full bloom, their petals a soft pink and white. These roses symbolize both English beauty and the Tudor rose. The overall composition should evoke a sense of history, elegance, and quintessential Englishness. The light should be soft and diffused, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. Avoid any harsh lines or shadows. The colour palette should be primarily pastel, with accents of red and gold to highlight Anne Boleyn's attire and the English rose. The image should have a gentle, nostalgic feel, reminiscent of classic portraiture.
