A watercolour illustration in a realistic style, 16:9 ratio. The scene depicts a nighttime street in a quaint British town, possibly near a pub signified by a softly glowing, traditional-style lantern hanging above a doorway. The main focus is on a police officer, rendered with meticulous detail, gently but firmly guiding a person towards a police car. The person being guided appears unsteady, suggesting intoxication, but the focus is not on exaggerated caricature. The police car, a classic British model, is parked under a streetlight, casting a pool of light that illuminates the interaction. The colour palette leans heavily on blues and greys to evoke a sense of night, punctuated by the red tail lights of the police car and the yellow glow of streetlamps. Subtle details, such as cobblestone streets, Victorian architecture in the background, and a light mist in the air, contribute to the British atmosphere. The overall composition should convey a sense of order and authority, emphasizing the immediate consequence of arrest. The style should be reminiscent of a detailed, hand-painted illustration from a classic children's book, avoiding any harsh lines or overly dramatic elements. The colours should either resemble the UK flag or be in a pastel colour palette.
