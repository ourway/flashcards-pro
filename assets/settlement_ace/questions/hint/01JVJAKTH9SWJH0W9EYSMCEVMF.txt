A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic, 2D watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The color palette should be pastel, utilizing soft blues, reds, and whites reminiscent of the UK flag. The central focus is a British soldier, clad in a modern combat uniform. He stands in front of the Houses of Parliament, aspiration visible on his face. A symbolic, stylized red line, thick and bold, diagonally traverses the image from the upper left to the lower right, effectively blocking the soldier's path towards the Parliament building. This line represents the legal restriction preventing active members of the armed forces from standing for public office. The Houses of Parliament should be rendered with detailed architectural accuracy, capturing the grandeur and historical significance of the building. The soldier's uniform should be accurately depicted, including the cut, color, and insignia. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of realism and highlighting the textures of the uniform and the architectural details of the Parliament. The overall composition should convey a sense of ambition thwarted by legal constraints, creating a memorable visual representation of the rule.
