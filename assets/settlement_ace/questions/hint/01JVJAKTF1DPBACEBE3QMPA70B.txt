A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The scene depicts the interior of a bright, clean hospital ward. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, soft reds, and gentle creams, reminiscent of the UK flag's hues but softer. The central focus is a patient lying comfortably in a hospital bed, with a visible IV drip connected to their arm. The IV bag is subtly tinted a life-giving red, symbolizing donated blood. Around the bed, medical professionals (a doctor and a nurse) are attending to the patient with care and precision. The doctor is checking the patient's pulse, while the nurse adjusts the IV. The background features blurred medical equipment like heart monitors and other essential tools, maintaining a sense of realism. The overall atmosphere should be calm, hopeful, and professional, emphasizing the hospital setting as a place of healing. The artwork should avoid any overly graphic or disturbing imagery, focusing instead on conveying a sense of medical care and recovery. The light source should be soft and diffused, creating a serene and reassuring environment.
