A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a pastel color palette (primarily light blues, whites, and reds reminiscent of the UK flag) depicting Cardiff, the capital of Wales. The composition should be centered on a vibrant city scene, with modern buildings and bustling streets filled with diverse pedestrians, all rendered in soft, pastel hues. Dominating the background, and slightly offset to maintain a balanced composition, is a detailed depiction of Cardiff Castle. The castle's architecture should be historically accurate and rendered with careful attention to its stone texture and intricate details. In the foreground, a gentle, winding river (the River Taff) flows through the city, reflecting the pastel colors of the buildings and sky. Symbolic elements include a small, stylized Welsh dragon subtly integrated into the city's architecture (perhaps adorning a building or as a statue in a square) to represent Welsh national identity. The overall mood should be bright, cheerful, and inviting, conveying a sense of the city's vibrant culture and historical significance, using light and shadow to create depth and realism. The image should aim to visually encode "Cardiff" as the answer through the prominent depiction of Cardiff Castle.
