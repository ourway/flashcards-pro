A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic legal illustrations, depicting the imposing facade of the High Court of Justice in London. The building should be central in the 16:9 landscape composition, its neo-Gothic architecture rendered with precision, capturing the intricate details of the stonework, arched windows, and statues. Dominant colours should be muted blues and greys, evoking a sense of solemnity and authority, with subtle accents of pastel blue and red in the architectural details, subtly referencing the UK flag. In the foreground, directly in front of the main entrance, depict two oversized chess pieces – a King and a Queen – locked in a strategic standoff. The King should be slightly larger and more ornate, symbolizing the high stakes involved in the cases handled by the court. Soft, diffused lighting should illuminate the scene, highlighting the architectural details and creating a sense of depth and gravitas. The overall impression should be one of dignified power and serious legal proceedings, serving as a visual mnemonic for the High Court's role in handling significant civil cases. The sky should be cloudy and overcast, reflecting the seriousness of the court's business. No people should be depicted in the image. The entire composition should feel balanced and harmonious, with a focus on realism and accurate architectural representation.
