A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical painting. The scene depicts Oliver Cromwell standing in the center of the frame against a backdrop of the Houses of Parliament blurred in the distance. Cromwell is not wearing a crown but instead has a stone well, overflowing with water, resting stably on his head. The well is intricately carved with scenes of everyday life from the period, subtly emphasizing his role as a leader of the people. The color palette leans heavily into muted blues, reds, and creams, echoing the colors of the UK flag but in pastel shades. The overall composition is balanced, with Cromwell and the "Crown-well" taking up the majority of the central space. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a sense of historical authenticity. The drawing should be in a realistic style, not cartoonish or abstract.
