A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor illustration in a pastel color palette (primarily blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the Union Jack). The central focus is a regal Prince of Wales, depicted as a man in his mid-thirties, standing in a grand, ornate waiting room. He is dressed in a finely tailored, dark blue suit, subtly hinting at his royal status with a small, elegant crest pinned to his lapel. He stands patiently, hands clasped gently in front of him, with a composed and slightly anticipatory expression. Behind him, partially obscured but still visible, is a massive, intricately carved oak door, symbolizing the entrance to the throne room. The door is slightly ajar, letting in a sliver of golden light, implying the current reign. The waiting room itself is decorated with subtle, sophisticated details: pastel blue walls adorned with framed portraits of previous monarchs (only their silhouettes are visible, not their faces), a plush, red velvet rope dividing the room, and a single, stately potted fern in the corner. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet anticipation, respect, and the enduring legacy of the British monarchy. The composition is carefully balanced to draw the eye to the Prince of Wales while subtly hinting at the power and history that awaits him.
