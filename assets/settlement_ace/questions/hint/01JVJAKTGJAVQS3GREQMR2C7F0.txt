A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, capturing the essence of speed and Scottish pride. The composition is centered on two distinct yet interconnected scenes. On the left, a vintage Formula One racing car, painted in a classic British racing green, speeds along a winding track reminiscent of Silverstone. The car's design should evoke the 1970s era, a nod to Jackie Stewart's prime. Subtle details include the driver's helmet, reflecting sunlight, and blurred background elements to convey motion. On the right, a track bicycle, predominantly in Scottish blue, leans forward as if in full sprint on a velodrome. The bicycle's frame should be sleek and modern, symbolizing Sir Chris Hoy's achievements. The background is a stylized representation of a velodrome, with blurred spectators suggesting the energy of a race. Linking the two scenes is a stylized Scottish flag gently waving in the background, its white cross subtly connecting the racing car and bicycle. The color palette should be a blend of pastel blues, greens, and reds, subtly referencing the UK flag while maintaining a soft, educational tone. The overall impression should be one of dynamic movement and sporting excellence, celebrating the achievements of these two iconic Scottish athletes.
