A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting four iconic cityscapes, each subtly merging into the next. The artwork should be created in a realistic style, not cartoonish. In the foreground (but still within the central 16:9 area), the majestic Houses of Parliament and Big Ben represent London, their architectural details rendered with precision in shades of grey stone and hints of pastel yellow for the clock face. Behind them, Edinburgh Castle sits atop its volcanic rock, depicted in muted browns and greens, blending slightly into the London skyline. To the right, the Belfast City Hall, rendered in pale stone with a verdant green lawn in front, transitions seamlessly from the Edinburgh scene. Finally, Cardiff Castle, with its distinctive Norman keep and Victorian Gothic mansion, completes the panorama on the far right, its Welsh flag subtly implied through the use of red and green hues in the surrounding foliage. The sky above should be a soft, gradient blend of pastel blues and whites, evocative of a typical British day. Subtle symbolic elements are included: a London black cab driving into Edinburgh, a Belfast ferry sailing towards Cardiff, all rendered in miniature. The overall composition should feel unified, suggesting the interconnectedness of these capital cities within the United Kingdom, with a colour palette that predominantly features pastel colours and muted tones reminiscent of the UK flag's colours (red, white and blue), but in a softer, more watercolour-appropriate style.
