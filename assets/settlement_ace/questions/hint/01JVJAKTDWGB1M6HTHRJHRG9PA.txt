A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, resembling a historical watercolor painting. The scene depicts a vast plantation landscape under a pastel sunrise, divided into two distinct sections. On the left, shadowy figures toil under the watchful eyes of overseers, their forms slightly blurred to represent the past. The ground is barren and cracked. Heavy chains lie discarded in the foreground, partially buried in the dry earth. On the right side of the image, the same figures stand tall and upright, bathed in the warm light of the rising sun, their faces showing hope and dignity. The landscape behind them is lush and green, symbolizing freedom and prosperity. The dividing line between the two scenes is subtle, marked by a symbolic, cracked bell lying on the ground, representing the liberty bell. The color palette leans heavily on pastel blues, reds and creams, reminiscent of the UK flag. The overall composition is balanced, with the rising sun acting as a focal point, emphasizing the dawn of a new era. The chains are rendered with intricate detail, highlighting their weight and significance. The figures are depicted with diverse features, representing the global impact of the abolition. The sky is filled with soft, billowing clouds, adding a sense of tranquility and optimism. The horizon line is slightly lower, emphasizing the figures' newfound freedom and the expansive landscape before them.
