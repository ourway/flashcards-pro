A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, reminiscent of classic British political cartoons. The composition is a regal, yet slightly stylized, portrait of Margaret Thatcher, positioned centrally within the 16:9 frame. She should be depicted in her characteristic power suit, a strong blue color, subtly echoing the blue of the Union Jack. Behind her, fading into a soft-focus background, is an iconic silhouette of the Houses of Parliament, rendered in muted pastel tones of grey and beige, as if viewed through a gentle fog. A single, sturdy iron beam diagonally bisects the background, not obstructing Thatcher, but subtly alluding to her "Iron Lady" moniker, rendered in a dark grey color. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, greys, and a hint of rose in Thatcher's cheeks, creating a dignified and memorable image. The style should evoke a sense of gravitas and historical importance, while remaining approachable and educational. The image is designed to visually connect Thatcher's image with the concept of long-lasting leadership in 20th-century Britain, using symbolic elements to reinforce memory recall.
