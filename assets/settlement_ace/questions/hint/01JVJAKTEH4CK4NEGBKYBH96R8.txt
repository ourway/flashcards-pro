A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style depicting a group of diverse teenagers, aged approximately 16-17, participating in various outdoor activities within a scenic British landscape. The scene should be set in the Lake District, with rolling green hills, a calm lake reflecting the sky, and distant mountains. In the foreground, a small group of teenagers are working together to pitch a tent, their faces showing concentration and teamwork. To the right, another group is shown rock climbing on a small, safe rock face, with instructors supervising. In the background, a third group is kayaking on the lake, their paddles creating gentle ripples in the water. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, green, and brown, with accents of red and white in the teenagers' clothing and equipment, subtly referencing the UK flag. The composition should emphasize the sense of adventure, learning, and camaraderie. The lighting is soft and natural, suggesting a pleasant summer day. The style should evoke a sense of youthful energy and the beauty of the British countryside. The focus is on portraying a positive and engaging experience that promotes personal development and outdoor skills.
