A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a charming, idealized British town square. Dominating the center is a grand, classically styled town hall building, its architecture reminiscent of Georgian or Victorian design, with a prominent clock tower. Radiating from the town hall are two distinct streams of light and symbolic elements, representing the two primary funding sources. To the left, a beam of light, predominantly blue, shines down from a stylized, slightly abstracted representation of the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, suggesting central government funding. This beam illuminates a group of diverse citizens happily engaged in community activities in the town square (a farmer selling produce, children playing, an elderly couple strolling). To the right, a beam of light, predominantly red, emanates from a collection of neatly arranged terraced houses, each displaying a subtly different architectural style, representing local taxes. The light illuminates another group of citizens diligently working on community projects â€“ repairing the town hall's facade, planting flowers in a public garden, and cleaning the streets. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades of blue, red, and white, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack without being overtly patriotic. The entire scene should evoke a sense of community, civic pride, and the harmonious collaboration between central and local entities. The artistic style should be realistic and detailed, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and conveying a sense of warmth and optimism.
