A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, showcasing the Welsh national holiday, St. David's Day. The central focus is a majestic, yet benevolent, red Welsh Dragon, its scales rendered with intricate detail, breathing a cascade of daffodils (the national flower of Wales) instead of fire. The dragon is positioned atop the rolling, green hills of Wales, dotted with traditional Welsh cottages with slate roofs. A young girl in traditional Welsh costume, complete with a tall black hat and shawl, is offering the dragon a leek (another symbol of Wales). The sky is a pastel blue, with soft, fluffy white clouds. The overall color palette leans towards the red, white, and green of the Welsh flag, accented by the yellow of the daffodils and the earthy tones of the landscape. The composition should evoke a sense of national pride, cultural richness, and historical significance, directly associating the dragon and daffodils with Wales and St. David's Day. The style should be detailed and realistic, but with the soft, flowing quality of watercolor, to create a warm and inviting image. The image should look like it came out of a children's book.
