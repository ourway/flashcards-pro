A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, set against a pastel sky transitioning from pale blue to soft pink. The primary focus is split between two iconic UK landmarks, centrally composed to occupy the 16:9 space. On the left, Edinburgh Castle is perched atop a rugged, green hill, rendered with detailed stonework showing its historical texture. The castle's flags gently wave in an implied breeze. To the right, the London Eye gracefully ascends above the River Thames, its capsules depicted with subtle reflections of the surrounding cityscape. The river below is a muted blue, reflecting the sky. A soft, diffused light bathes the scene, casting gentle shadows that accentuate the depth and detail of each landmark. Connect the two landmarks with a faint, dotted line, suggesting their inclusion as UK landmarks. The color palette leans towards pastel variations of the UK flag's colors – soft blues, muted reds, and creamy whites – to subtly reinforce the British context. The overall composition aims for a serene and memorable visual representation, aiding in recall without being overly cluttered.
