A watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a protective, symbolic scene related to the criminalisation of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). The central focus is a stylized, blossoming rose, representing womanhood and beauty, its petals rendered in soft pastel pinks and creams. Encircling the rose is a strong, interwoven barrier of thorny branches, symbolizing legal protection. The branches are coloured in muted greens and browns, providing a natural contrast to the rose. Behind the rose and the protective barrier, the background fades into a soft, watercolour wash of pastel blues and whites, evoking a sense of safety and serenity. At the top of the image, a stylized scale of justice is subtly incorporated, balanced and radiating a gentle, golden light, symbolizing fairness and the rule of law. The overall composition should convey a sense of protection, justice, and the safeguarding of women's rights within the legal framework of the UK, with the pastel colour palette creating a gentle and reassuring atmosphere. The image should evoke a feeling of safety and security, emphasizing that the law is in place to protect women and girls from harm, wherever they may be. The illustration should be highly detailed, with careful attention paid to the texture of the rose petals and the intricacies of the thorny branches.
