A 16:9, landscape-oriented, hand-drawn watercolour illustration depicting a symbolic representation of forced marriage as a criminal offense in the UK. The central focus is on a young woman, rendered in a realistic style, with a tear rolling down her cheek, but her expression is one of quiet strength and resolve. She's dressed in a traditional, simple dress, and her hands are gently breaking a thin, symbolic chain that binds her wrists. The chain is coloured in muted grey tones to represent oppression. Behind her, slightly blurred to indicate its past, is a silhouette of a shadowy figure representing an abusive partner. The background transitions from dark, stormy blues and greys on the left side (representing the forced marriage) to soft, pastel shades of dawn (pinks, light blues, and yellows) on the right, symbolizing freedom and hope. A single, vibrant red poppy, a symbol of remembrance and resilience in the UK, grows near her feet. The overall art style should evoke a sense of quiet determination and the triumph of justice, using a pastel colour palette with subtle accents of the UK flag colours. The composition should guide the viewer's eye from the oppressive shadow to the hopeful dawn, emphasizing the woman's act of breaking free. The watercolor technique should be loose and expressive, conveying emotion through subtle washes of colour and delicate details.
