A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical watercolour illustrations. The scene centers on a group of determined Suffragettes marching down a London street, circa early 1900s. The colour palette leans heavily on pastel hues, interspersed with bold reds, whites, and blues to subtly evoke the colours of the UK flag. The women are dressed in period clothing â€“ long skirts, tailored jackets, and hats adorned with ribbons and flowers. They carry banners with symbolic, yet text-free, representations of women's rights: a stylized scale balanced equally, a rising sun illuminating female silhouettes, and a chain breaking apart. The lead Suffragette holds a symbolic staff topped with a dove, representing peace and their non-violent approach in the early years of the movement. A backdrop of iconic London architecture, such as a blurred image of the Houses of Parliament, provides context. The composition emphasizes the unity and determination of the group, with their faces etched with resolve. Subtle details, like the reflection of the scene in a rain puddle on the cobblestone street, add depth and realism. The overall feeling should be one of dignified strength and unwavering commitment to their cause. The image should be framed in a 16:9 ratio.
