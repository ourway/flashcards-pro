A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a regal figure, Kenneth MacAlpin, depicted as a strong, determined king with a flowing red beard and piercing blue eyes. He wears a stylized, historically-inspired crown and a cloak fastened with a Celtic brooch. He stands atop a rugged, windswept Scottish highland, painted in shades of green, brown, and heather purple. In the background, Viking longships, rendered as silhouettes against a stormy, pastel-colored sky, approach the coastline. The ships are stylized to appear ominous but not overly threatening. In the foreground, at Kenneth MacAlpin's feet, are symbolic representations of the diverse Scottish clans, such as a thistle, a Pictish stone carving fragment, and a shepherdâ€™s crook, all arranged to suggest unity and protection. The overall color palette should lean towards cool tones of blue, green, and gray, reminiscent of the Scottish landscape, with pops of warm red in MacAlpin's beard and cloak to draw the eye. The art style should be reminiscent of historical illustrations found in illuminated manuscripts, with careful attention to detail in the depiction of clothing, weaponry, and the natural environment. The composition should convey a sense of strength, resilience, and the forging of a nation against a common enemy.
