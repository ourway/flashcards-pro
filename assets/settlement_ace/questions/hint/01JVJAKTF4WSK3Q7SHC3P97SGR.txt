A watercolor painting in a realistic style, capturing a street scene in Belfast, Northern Ireland, during the 1970s. The color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, gray, and muted reds, echoing the colors of the UK flag while maintaining a somber tone. In the center of the image, a street barricade constructed from overturned vehicles and debris divides the scene. On one side, a group of civilians, depicted with worried expressions, stand near terraced houses with Union Jack flags subtly displayed. On the other side, a group of police officers in riot gear are visible, creating a visual tension. Wisps of smoke rise in the background, hinting at recent disturbances. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light that emphasizes the gravity of the situation. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of the divided community and the palpable unrest that characterized the Troubles, serving as a visual mnemonic for the significant unrest of the 1970s in Northern Ireland. The scene should feel authentic and historically grounded, avoiding any cartoonish or overly dramatic elements.
