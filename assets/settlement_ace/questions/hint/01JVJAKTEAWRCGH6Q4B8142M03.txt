A watercolor illustration in a pastel color palette (primarily light blues, soft reds, and creams), depicting the entrance to a Youth Court in the UK. The style should be realistic, resembling a hand-drawn architectural rendering, but with a gentle, approachable feel. The main focus is a pair of wooden doors, slightly ajar, revealing a softly lit interior suggesting privacy and confidentiality. A young oak tree with vibrant green leaves stands guard to the left of the doors, symbolizing growth, youth, and protection. To the right, a faded red British phone box stands slightly back, representing the broader community but also suggesting distance and separation from the sensitive proceedings. A single, symbolic padlock hangs subtly on one of the door handles, representing restricted access. A sign above the door is deliberately blurred and unreadable, emphasizing the confidential nature of the court. The overall atmosphere should evoke a sense of quiet solemnity and protection, with an emphasis on shielding the young people within from the public gaze. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a safe and secure feeling. The scene should be set in a slightly elevated position, giving the viewer a sense of looking down upon the entrance, further emphasizing the exclusivity.
