A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a cheerful scene of children playing in a schoolyard. The school building in the background is quaint and inviting, reminiscent of a traditional English schoolhouse with a slate roof and large windows. Above the school, a flock of doves is flying freely in a clear blue sky, subtly alluding to the concept of 'free' and 'liberty'. The schoolyard is bustling with activity: children are engaged in various games, some are painting on easels, others are reading books under the shade of a large oak tree. Dominant colors are pastel shades of blue, red and white, subtly mirroring the UK flag. The overall composition is centered around the schoolhouse and the children, conveying a sense of community, learning, and accessibility. The sunlight is soft and diffused, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The image evokes a feeling of openness and opportunity, reflecting the idea of a school that is accessible to all children in the community. No text should be included in the image.
