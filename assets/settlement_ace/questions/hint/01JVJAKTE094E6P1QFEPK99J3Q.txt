A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical paintings. The scene is divided into two distinct halves, visually separated by a stylized, winding river representing the Irish Sea. The left side depicts a Norman castle perched atop a green, rolling hill in England, circa 1066. A regal figure, William the Conqueror, clad in Norman armor with a golden crown, stands triumphantly before it, holding a banner emblazoned with three golden lions. The English landscape is bathed in a warm, golden light, conveying a sense of victory and establishment. On the right side, representing Ireland, a similar, but distinctly Celtic castle stands amidst a rugged, rocky coastline. A figure resembling William of Orange, also in regal attire but with orange accents in his clothing, looks pensively out to sea. The Irish landscape is rendered in cooler tones of blue and grey, with a stormy sky overhead, symbolizing a different, less triumphant atmosphere. A faint, ghostly image of William the Conqueror with a red "X" across him hovers in the sky above Ireland, subtly reinforcing the incorrect association. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, greens, and golds, with subtle hints of red and orange to subtly evoke the UK flag colors and to differentiate the two Williams. The composition emphasizes the separation and contrast between the two historical figures and their respective domains, reinforcing the fact that William the Conqueror is tied to England, not Ireland.
