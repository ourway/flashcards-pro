A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, capturing a scene from 19th-century rural Ireland. The primary focus is a lush, overflowing potato field under a cloudy sky, occupying the central space of the 16:9 canvas. The potato plants are depicted with vibrant green leaves and earthy brown soil, some with freshly dug potatoes scattered around, revealing their various sizes and textures. In the background, rolling green hills dotted with stone cottages under a pastel blue and grey sky, suggesting the Irish landscape. In the mid-ground, depict a family of Irish farmers – a mother, father, and two children – harvesting the potatoes. Their clothing is simple and reflects the period, with muted, earthy tones. The mother is carefully placing potatoes into a woven basket, while the father uses a spade to unearth more. The children are helping, one carrying a smaller basket and the other picking up loose potatoes. The overall color palette leans towards pastel greens, browns, blues, and grays, with subtle hints of red in the clothing details, echoing the colors of the UK flag but in a muted, natural way. The composition should evoke a sense of both abundance and the reliance on this single crop, hinting at the vulnerability of the community. The style should be reminiscent of classic landscape paintings, with a focus on realism and detail, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements.
