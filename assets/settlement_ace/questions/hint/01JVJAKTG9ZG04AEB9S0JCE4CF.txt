A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour illustration depicting a lively Hogmanay celebration in a quaint Scottish village. The scene is set against a backdrop of snow-dusted, rolling hills under a twilight sky, with a full moon casting a soft glow. In the center, a group of villagers, dressed in traditional tartan attire, joyously parade through the cobblestone streets, carrying flaming torches that illuminate their smiling faces. A bagpiper, also in traditional dress, leads the procession, his bagpipes embellished with intricate Celtic knotwork. Children are depicted running alongside, some playfully rolling blazing barrels down the gentle slope of the street - a symbolic gesture to burn off the old year. Colour palette is predominantly pastel blues, purples, and oranges of the sunset sky, with accents of red and green from the tartan and torch flames. The composition should evoke a sense of warmth, community, and spirited festivity, capturing the essence of Hogmanay as a high and many celebration. The overall style should be realistic, detailed, and infused with the charm of a traditional Scottish New Year's Eve.
