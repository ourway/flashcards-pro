A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style (not cartoonish or abstract), depicting a grand, ornate table set against the backdrop of the Houses of Parliament in London. The table is draped with a cloth that subtly blends the colors of the UK flag – red, white, and blue – in a harmonious, pastel palette. On the table, a scroll representing the Bill of Rights is prominently displayed, partially unrolled to reveal elegant calligraphy. A majestic quill pen rests beside it, implying the act of writing and formalizing the document. Balanced on either side of the scroll are symbolic scales of justice, one side slightly higher than the other, representing the shift in power. On the higher side of the scale sits a miniature, detailed representation of the Houses of Parliament, symbolizing parliamentary authority, while on the lower side is a stylized crown, representing the King's diminished power. The overall composition emphasizes balance and the transfer of authority. Soft, natural light streams through the arched windows of the Houses of Parliament, illuminating the scene and casting gentle shadows that enhance the depth and realism of the illustration. The background should be slightly blurred to keep the focus on the objects on the table. The image should evoke a sense of historical importance, legal precision, and the establishment of parliamentary rights. The image ratio is 16:9.
