A hand-drawn, realistic watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a serene scene centered around a large, antique clock tower reminiscent of Elizabeth Tower in London, but with subtle differences to avoid direct copyright infringement. The clock face prominently displays the time 11:00 AM, with the hands clearly visible against a pale blue clock face. Around the base of the clock tower, a crowd of diverse individuals stands silently with bowed heads. The crowd includes veterans with poppies pinned to their chests, families with young children, and people from various ethnic backgrounds, all united in solemn respect. The sky above is a soft, pastel blue, transitioning to a gentle peach near the horizon, evoking a sense of peace and remembrance. Scattered throughout the scene are vibrant red poppy flowers, symbolizing remembrance, gently swaying in a soft breeze. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, with touches of muted gold on the clock tower's details. The composition emphasizes the clock tower as the focal point, drawing the viewer's eye to the significant time. The style is reminiscent of classic watercolour illustrations, with soft edges and delicate brushstrokes, creating a poignant and respectful visual representation of Remembrance Day. The atmosphere should be quiet and reflective, capturing the essence of a two-minute silence.
