A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the Union Jack flag gracefully waving in a gentle breeze. The flag should be the central focus, occupying a significant portion of the frame. The Union Jack's vibrant colors – the deep blues, striking reds, and crisp whites – should be accurately rendered, capturing the flag's iconic design. Behind the flag, subtly incorporate symbolic elements representing the four countries united by it: a sprig of shamrock (Ireland), a thistle (Scotland), a Tudor rose (England), and a leek (Wales). These elements should be delicately painted in pastel hues, blending seamlessly into a soft, diffused background. The sky above should be a light, airy blue with a few wispy, pastel-colored clouds, adding to the overall serene and patriotic atmosphere. The composition should be balanced, with the flag appearing to be slightly angled as if caught in a gentle gust of wind, conveying a sense of pride and unity. The watercolor style should lend a soft, textured feel to the image, enhancing its artistic appeal and educational value.
