A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor illustration depicting the Houses of Parliament, specifically focusing on the House of Lords chamber. The overall color palette leans towards a pastel rendition of the UK flag colors, dominated by soft blues, muted reds, and creams. Inside the House of Lords, various figures representing peers are seated, dressed in traditional robes. However, the key visual element is the absence of a visible voting process or polling station. Instead of people queuing to vote, the space where one might expect a ballot box is filled with lush, overgrown ivy, subtly obscuring the area and symbolizing the non-elected nature of the Lords. Sunlight streams through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, creating a serene yet authoritative atmosphere. The composition is centered on the chamber, ensuring all elements are visible within the 16:9 aspect ratio. The art style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy blended with artistic license, reminiscent of a detailed architectural illustration found in a historical textbook. The scene conveys a sense of tradition and established order, underlining the fact that members of the House of Lords are not elected by the general public.
