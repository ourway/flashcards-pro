A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting Colin Firth and Tilda Swinton, each holding a golden Oscar statue. The backdrop features a stylized representation of the British flag, subtly blurred to maintain focus on the subjects. Colin Firth is depicted with a warm, celebratory smile, wearing a classic black tuxedo, while Tilda Swinton stands beside him, exuding her characteristic elegance in a modern, minimalist gown with pastel colours. The lighting is soft and golden, emanating from the Oscars, casting gentle highlights on their faces and clothing. The composition should centrally position both actors, with the British flag forming a soft, patriotic halo around them. Delicate watercolor washes create depth and texture, while fine line work defines facial features and clothing details. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, punctuated by the rich gold of the Oscar statues and subtle reds, whites, and blues in the background flag. The painting should evoke a sense of pride, accomplishment, and British artistic excellence, serving as a visual mnemonic for their Oscar wins.
