A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a scene within a warmly lit, classically British restaurant. The composition is centered, adhering to a 16:9 aspect ratio. The color palette leans towards pastel hues, subtly incorporating reds and blues reminiscent of the UK flag. The main focus is a beautifully rendered dining table set for a meal. On one side of the table, an individual, clearly appearing to be 16 years old, sits with a downcast expression. Their body language conveys disappointment. Opposite them, an empty wine glass is prominently displayed, subtly knocked over on its side, with a single, glistening droplet of spilled red liquid near it, symbolizing a denied request. Behind the table, slightly blurred but still discernible, a waiter is subtly shaking their head with a sympathetic but firm expression. The background features classic British restaurant decor: dark wood paneling, soft lighting from sconces, and framed artwork depicting pastoral scenes. The overall mood should be one of gentle disappointment and quiet enforcement of the law, creating a memorable visual representation of the illegality of underage drinking, even with a meal, in a hotel or restaurant. The scene should evoke a sense of realism and empathy.
