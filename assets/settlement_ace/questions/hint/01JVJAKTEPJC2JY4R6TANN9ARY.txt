A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor painting in a pastel color palette (primarily blues, whites, and soft reds) depicting the island of St Helena as a separate, tranquil haven. The island should be rendered with lush green vegetation cascading down volcanic slopes towards a serene, turquoise coastline. A solitary, stylized British sailing ship, painted in soft whites and blues, is depicted sailing away from the island towards the right of the frame, symbolizing the separation. The ship should be visually distinct but not overpowering, maintaining the focus on the island. A clear, light blue sky with soft, white, puffy clouds should fill the upper portion of the frame. The overall composition should emphasize the island's isolation and self-contained beauty, with a visual sense of distance and tranquility. Subtle hints of the island's unique flora and fauna (e.g., the St Helena plover) can be included, but should be secondary to the overall impression of a separate, peaceful haven. The art style should evoke a sense of historical documentation, reminiscent of naturalist illustrations from the 18th or 19th century. The island should be positioned slightly off-center, allowing the sailing ship to create a visual narrative of departure and independence.
