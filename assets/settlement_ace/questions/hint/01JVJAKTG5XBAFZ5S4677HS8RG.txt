A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting a stylized globe, predominantly colored in soft pastel blues and greens to represent the oceans and landmasses. Around the globe, 53 distinct national flags are arranged in a circular, slightly overlapping pattern, each flag meticulously detailed and waving gently as if in a soft breeze. The flags are not identifiable by their real-world counterparts but are unique in colours and patterns. The globe is positioned slightly off-center, allowing the flags to be the primary focus. The flags are rendered in pastel shades of red, white, and blue, echoing the colors of the UK flag and reinforcing the connection to the Commonwealth. The overall composition is bright and airy, with soft, diffused lighting that creates a sense of unity and cooperation. The background is a plain, off-white color to ensure that the globe and flags remain the central visual elements. The style should be realistic, but with a gentle, artistic touch, avoiding harsh lines and overly saturated colors. The image should evoke a sense of global community and shared heritage, reflecting the values of the Commonwealth.
