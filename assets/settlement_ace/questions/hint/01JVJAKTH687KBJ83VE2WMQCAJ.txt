A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, showcasing a panoramic view of London. The composition is centered on the River Thames, winding its way through the heart of the city. Prominent landmarks should be visible, including the Houses of Parliament with Big Ben standing tall, St. Paul's Cathedral with its iconic dome, and the Tower Bridge with its raised bascules. Red double-decker buses traverse the bridge, adding a touch of quintessential London life. The London Eye rotates gently in the background, symbolizing the modern era. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel blues and creams for the sky and water, contrasted with the red of the buses and the warm stone tones of the buildings. Subtle hints of the Union Jack's colors (red, white, and blue) should be integrated throughout the scene â€“ perhaps a red telephone box near the riverbank, white clouds in the sky, and blue reflections in the water. The overall atmosphere should be bright and inviting, capturing the vibrancy and historical significance of London. The level of detail is high, allowing viewers to visually explore the iconic landmarks and associate them with the idea of London as the capital city. No text should be included in the image; the visual elements alone should convey the meaning.
