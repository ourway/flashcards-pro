A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the Tower of London on a misty morning. The composition focuses on the iconic White Tower, rendered in aged, light-grey stone, with subtle variations in the stone texture to convey its historical age. A faint, ethereal mist swirls around the base of the tower, partially obscuring the lower levels and creating an atmosphere of somber mystery. A lone raven, depicted in rich black detail, perches on one of the tower's crenellations, its gaze directed downwards, adding to the sense of foreboding. In the foreground, a suggestion of the Tower Green is visible, rendered in muted greens and browns. The color palette leans heavily on pastel shades of blue, grey, and beige, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag, but in a desaturated, historical tone. The overall mood is one of quiet reflection and historical weight, designed to evoke the Tower's role as a site of imprisonment and execution, specifically reminding the viewer of Anne Boleyn's fate. The sky is a soft, gradient of pale blues and greys, hinting at the dawn, but lacking any direct sunlight, maintaining a sense of solemnity. The style should be reminiscent of historical illustrations, prioritizing accuracy and detail over overt artistic flair.
