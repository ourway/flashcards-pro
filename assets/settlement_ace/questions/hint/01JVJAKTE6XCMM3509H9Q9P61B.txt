A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour image in a realistic style, depicting the iconic Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) in London, sharply in focus against a soft, pastel-colored sky of dawn breaking. The clock face on Big Ben should prominently display the time: 11:00 AM. Light pastel blues, pinks, and whites should dominate the sky, creating a serene and hopeful atmosphere. Below Big Ben, a field of vibrant red poppies stretches towards the horizon. Intertwined within the poppy field are silhouettes of soldiers walking away from the viewer, fading into the distance, representing the end of the war and their return home. The soldiers are not overly detailed but are recognizable as figures from the World War I era. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peace and remembrance. The style should be reminiscent of classic war memorial paintings, with a focus on detail and emotional impact. The colours should subtly incorporate the red from the UK flag in the poppies and pastel blues and whites in the sky. The image should not contain any text or numbers and should be suitable for educational purposes. The image ratio should be 16:9. The main subject and idea should be mainly in the center of the image (16:9 ratio bounderies).
