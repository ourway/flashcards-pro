A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a brightly lit artist's studio. The central focus is on an easel holding a partially completed abstract painting with bold strokes of blues, reds, and whites reminiscent of the UK flag, but in a pastel palette. Various art supplies are scattered around the easel: paint tubes in disarray, brushes of different sizes soaking in a jar of water, and a palette smeared with colours. Natural light pours in from a large window on the left, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting soft shadows within the studio. To the right of the easel stands a sculpture, abstract in form, perhaps suggesting a human figure or a natural element. The overall impression is one of creative energy and artistic exploration. The colours should be soft and muted, creating a peaceful and inspiring atmosphere. The style should be realistic, capturing the textures of the canvas, the sheen of the paint, and the details of the studio environment, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements. The composition should draw the eye towards the painting on the easel, emphasizing the theme of art and creativity.
