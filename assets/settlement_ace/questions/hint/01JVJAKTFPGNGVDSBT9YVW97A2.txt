A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting two intertwined Welsh dragons, one primarily red and the other white, symbolizing the equal representation of English and Welsh languages. The dragons are facing each other in a mirrored pose, their bodies forming a gentle, looping knot in the center of the 16:9 frame. The red dragon breathes out a wisp of steam shaped like an English book, while the white dragon emits a similar wisp shaped like a Welsh manuscript. The background is a pastel-colored landscape of rolling Welsh hills, dotted with traditional stone cottages. The sky is a gradient of soft blues and whites, reminiscent of the Welsh flag. The overall composition is balanced and symmetrical, emphasizing the theme of equality. The dragons' scales are individually rendered with subtle color variations, and the landscape features realistic textures of grass, stone, and foliage. The artwork should evoke a sense of cultural pride and linguistic harmony within Wales, using a pastel colour palette, with red and white being dominant. The image is strictly 2D, with no 3D elements or text included.
