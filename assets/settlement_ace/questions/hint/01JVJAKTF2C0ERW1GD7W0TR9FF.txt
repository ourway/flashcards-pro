A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a Scottish courtroom scene. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly reflecting the UK flag's colors. Dominating the center of the 16:9 canvas is a jury box, meticulously rendered with twelve distinct figures seated within. Each juror is individually portrayed with diverse ages, genders, and ethnicities, all exhibiting expressions of thoughtful consideration. They are dressed in contemporary clothing, avoiding any specific period attire. In the foreground, a gavel rests gently on a polished wooden surface, partially obscured by a soft, diffused light source emanating from a high window. Behind the jury box, hinted in soft focus, are the silhouettes of legal professionals - a judge, lawyers â€“ suggesting the gravity of the proceedings. The courtroom's architecture is subtly Scottish, featuring stone walls and arched windows. The overall composition emphasizes the centrality of the twelve jurors, drawing the eye to their collective presence as the core of the judicial process. The light throughout the image is soft and diffused, creating a solemn and respectful atmosphere. The background should be blurred to focus on the jury.
