A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a serene British neighborhood scene with a focus on community and responsibility. The color palette should be primarily pastel, incorporating subtle hues of red, white, and blue reminiscent of the UK flag. In the center of the 16:9 landscape, visualize a tidy row of terraced houses with well-maintained gardens. One garden features a family planting flowers together, symbolizing taking care of one's family. To the left, a person is sweeping the sidewalk in front of their house, representing maintaining the area where they live. Further to the left, a recycling bin overflowing with neatly sorted items highlights environmental responsibility. To the right, depict a person jogging in a park, indicating taking care of oneself. In the background, a gently rolling green hill with sheep grazing represents the wider environment. The sky should be a soft, watercolor wash of blue with fluffy white clouds. The overall composition emphasizes harmony and balance, illustrating the interconnectedness of personal responsibility, family care, community upkeep, and environmental consciousness. The style should evoke a sense of warmth, tranquility, and civic pride.
