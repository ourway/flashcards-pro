A serene, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a stylized, yet realistic, "safe harbor." The central focus is a quaint, pastel-colored cottage nestled within a protective cove. The cottage, representing a shelter or refuge, has a warm, inviting glow emanating from its windows, suggesting safety and welcome. The cove is surrounded by gentle, rolling hills of lush green, dotted with wildflowers in pastel shades of pink, yellow, and blue. The sea in the foreground is calm and a soft turquoise, reflecting the sky above. A stylized, simplified lighthouse stands guard on one side of the cove entrance, its beam represented by subtle, radiating lines of light. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peace, security, and protection. The color palette should primarily consist of soft pastel shades, with accents of red and blue reminiscent of the UK flag subtly integrated into the wildflowers and window frames of the cottage. The art style should be realistic with soft, blended watercolor textures, avoiding sharp lines or harsh contrasts. The image should convey the idea of a safe haven, representing shelters and refuges for those experiencing domestic violence, without depicting any people or explicit scenes of violence. The goal is to create a calming and reassuring visual mnemonic.
