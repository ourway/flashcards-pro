A hand-drawn, realistic, watercolour image depicting the exterior of a traditional British pub on a slightly overcast morning. The pub, named "The Crown & Pint," is built of weathered stone, with a dark wooden door slightly ajar, invitingly revealing a warm, golden light spilling onto the cobblestone street. Two vintage-style, cast-iron lampposts flank the entrance, their glass globes softly glowing. A hanging pub sign, intricately painted with a golden crown above a frothy pint of ale, gently sways in the breeze. Flower boxes overflowing with red geraniums and white petunias adorn the windowsills, adding a splash of vibrant colour. The sky is a soft, pastel blue-grey, hinting at the morning's gentle start. In the foreground, a classic red telephone box stands to the side, and a black bicycle is leaning against the pub wall. The overall color palette leans towards the red, white, and blue of the UK flag, subtly incorporated through the flowers, the sky, and details on the pub sign. The image should evoke a sense of calm and tradition, capturing the essence of a quintessential British pub ready to welcome its first customers of the day, implying the opening time without explicitly showing a clock. The composition should be centered on the pub entrance, drawing the viewer's eye to the welcoming light and the promise of warmth within.
