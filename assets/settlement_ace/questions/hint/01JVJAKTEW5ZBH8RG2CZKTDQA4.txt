A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting two grand buildings side-by-side under a pastel sky with soft, blended colors. The building on the left represents the Scottish Parliament, styled with modern architecture incorporating natural stone and glass, evoking the rugged Scottish landscape. A stylized thistle, rendered in soft purple and green hues, subtly adorns the building's entrance. The building on the right symbolizes the Welsh Assembly, featuring a design that blends traditional Welsh architectural elements with a contemporary aesthetic. A stylized Welsh dragon, colored in muted red tones, is subtly incorporated into the building's facade. Between the two buildings, a winding path, colored in the pale blue of the UK flag, gently slopes upwards, joining the entrances of both buildings. The composition is symmetrical, emphasizing equality and partnership. The overall color palette consists of pastel shades of blue, green, purple, and red, subtly referencing the colors of the UK flag while maintaining a gentle, educational tone. The scene is bathed in soft, diffused light, creating a welcoming and informative atmosphere. The image should be strictly 2D and not 3D.
