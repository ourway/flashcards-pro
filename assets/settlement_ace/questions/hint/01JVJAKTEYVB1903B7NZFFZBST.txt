A serene, hand-drawn watercolor painting depicting two distinct landscapes separated by a gently flowing river. On the left side of the river, representing England, a grand, ornate cathedral with classic Anglican architectural features rises majestically under a clear blue sky with fluffy white clouds. The cathedral is surrounded by lush green fields dotted with sheep, symbolizing England's agricultural heritage. On the right side of the river, representing Scotland, a smaller, yet equally beautiful, stone church with a Celtic cross prominently displayed stands proudly amidst a rugged, mountainous terrain with heather in bloom. The sky above Scotland is a soft, misty grey, reflecting the Highlands' atmospheric conditions. The river acts as a natural border, visually emphasizing the separation. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades of blue, green, and grey, reminiscent of the UK flag's subtle tones. A subtle visual cue suggesting independence should be present, such as the cathedral and church facing slightly away from each other. The overall composition should be balanced and harmonious, highlighting the distinct yet equally important identities of the Church of England and the Scottish Episcopal Church.
