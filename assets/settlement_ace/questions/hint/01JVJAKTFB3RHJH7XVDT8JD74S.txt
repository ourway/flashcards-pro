A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image, ratio 16:9, depicting a scene of global unity emerging from the aftermath of war. The central focus is a large, stylized dove, its wings outstretched, painted in soft, pastel blues and whites, symbolizing peace. The dove is flying over a landscape gradually transitioning from a war-torn scene on the left to a flourishing, vibrant scene on the right. The left side features muted, desaturated colors - greys, browns, and dark blues - representing the destruction of the Second World War: crumbling buildings, skeletal trees, and faint silhouettes of soldiers. The right side bursts with life and color - lush green fields, blossoming trees with pastel pink flowers, and diverse figures of people from different nations holding hands in a circle. These figures are drawn in a realistic style, each with distinct cultural attire. Above the dove, a soft, golden light emanates, illuminating the right side of the image, signifying hope and a new beginning. The overall composition should convey a sense of transformation and the establishment of peace and unity after conflict. The color palette should be primarily pastel, with subtle hints of red, white, and blue to subtly evoke the UK flag, creating a visually appealing and educational image.
