A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic, watercolour style, depicting a divided Irish landscape under a stormy sky. The illustration is in a 16:9 landscape format. In the center of the image, a jagged, naturally formed, yet distinct, border cuts through the Emerald Isle. To the left of the divide, rolling green hills dotted with quaint villages and ancient stone walls evoke the Republic of Ireland. Symbolic shamrocks are subtly integrated into the landscape. To the right, representing Northern Ireland, the landscape is similar, but with subtle differences: perhaps a slightly more rugged terrain, and small, stylized representations of historically significant buildings. Above this division, dark, swirling storm clouds gather, mirroring the turbulent history. Below, the green fields transition into a turbulent sea, reflecting the historical conflicts. The overall colour palette should be predominantly pastel greens and blues, with hints of greys and stormy blues in the sky. The composition should emphasize the central division, with the stormy sky acting as a visual representation of "The Troubles". The aim is to capture the essence of a divided Ireland, without any text, focusing on the geographical and symbolic elements to represent the disagreement over the island's unification.
