A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting depicting a lush, rolling landscape under a pastel-blue sky in Wiltshire, England. The central focus is Stonehenge, rendered in realistic detail with its weathered stones casting soft shadows on the grassy ground. Surrounding Stonehenge, a scene of "wild" nature unfolds: rabbits playfully dart through tall grasses, a deer gracefully grazes near a cluster of wildflowers (primarily bluebells and poppies, subtly echoing the UK flag's colors), and birds circle overhead. The landscape should gently slope upwards towards the horizon, featuring scattered ancient trees with gnarled branches, their leaves painted in various shades of green and gold. A winding, narrow path leads from the foreground towards Stonehenge, suggesting a journey through time. The overall color palette should be dominated by pastel greens, blues, and yellows, with accents of red in the poppies and brown in the ancient stones. The style should be realistic yet retain the soft, dreamy quality of watercolor, evoking a sense of history and tranquility. The scene aims to capture the "wild" essence of Wiltshire in a serene and memorable composition.
