A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant Scottish landscape under a pastel-blue sky. The focal point is a portrait of Robert Burns, rendered with thoughtful detail to capture his kind expression and slightly windswept hair. He is positioned centrally, his gaze directed towards the viewer. Around Burns, a rolling vista of purple heather-covered hills and green glens stretches into the distance. A traditional stone cottage with a thatched roof sits nestled among the hills. A gnarled, ancient oak tree, symbolic of Scotland's enduring history, frames the scene on the left. In the foreground, a quill and open book rest upon a rocky outcrop, suggesting Burns's literary contributions. A subtle tartan pattern is woven into the landscape, perhaps represented in the colors of the heather or the stone of the cottage. The color palette should be dominated by pastel blues, greens, purples, and browns, subtly echoing the colors of the Scottish landscape while maintaining a soft, educational tone. The overall composition should evoke a sense of romanticism, national pride, and the timeless beauty of Scotland. Avoid any text or numbers within the image.
