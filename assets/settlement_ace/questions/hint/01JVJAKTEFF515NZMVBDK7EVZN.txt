A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor painting, in a realistic style, depicting a somber scene set within the Tower of London. The color palette should lean towards muted blues, grays, and deep reds, reminiscent of the UK flag but softened into a pastel tone to evoke the gravity of the event. The composition is centered, focusing on a weathered wooden executioner's block positioned in a courtyard. A single, gleaming axe rests upon the block, its blade reflecting the pale light filtering through the high, barred windows of the tower. Framing the block are subtle symbolic elements: withered Scottish thistles intertwined with fading English roses, lying on the ground, suggesting the conflict between Scotland and England. A raven perches on a nearby battlement, its dark silhouette adding to the scene's ominous atmosphere. The ground is damp, reflecting the somber mood, and a faint mist hangs in the air, typical of London weather. The overall style should be reminiscent of a historical illustration, aiming for accuracy and emotional impact, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements. The image should evoke a sense of finality and historical weight, serving as a visual reminder of Mary, Queen of Scots' execution.
