A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a symbolic representation of Scotland's break from papal authority in 1560. The central image features a robust thistle, the national flower of Scotland, growing powerfully through cracked stone that represents the Vatican. The thistle's roots are firmly planted in Scottish soil, visualized as fertile, green land with rolling hills reminiscent of the Scottish Highlands. The cracked stone, colored in muted grays and creams, features subtle carvings of papal symbols, such as crossed keys and a mitre, now fractured and crumbling. Above the thistle, a beam of sunlight, colored in pastel gold, breaks through dark, stormy clouds, illuminating the flower. The clouds, swirling in shades of deep blue and gray, symbolize the religious conflicts of the time. Tiny details, such as dew drops on the thistleâ€™s leaves and moss growing on the cracked stone, enhance the realism. The overall color palette leans towards the blues and whites of the Scottish flag, with accents of green and gold to represent hope and prosperity. The composition is centered, focusing on the thistle as a symbol of Scottish resilience and independence, visually reinforcing the break from the Pope's authority. The image evokes a sense of liberation and the birth of a new era for Scotland.
