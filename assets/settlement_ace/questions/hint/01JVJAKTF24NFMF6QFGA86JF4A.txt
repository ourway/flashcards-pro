A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9, depicting a regal portrait of Queen Mary I of England, known as "Bloody Mary," set against a somber, muted backdrop. The color palette leans heavily on deep reds, symbolizing the bloodshed associated with her reign, contrasting with pale, almost ghostly whites and grays to evoke a sense of unease and historical weight. Mary is adorned in a Tudor-era gown, the fabric a rich, dark crimson, subtly patterned with thorny roses, their petals stained with droplets of red. Her face, framed by dark hair pulled back tightly, is pale and stern, her eyes conveying a sense of unwavering resolve, tinged with melancholy. In her hand, she holds a single, blood-red rose, its stem dripping a viscous, crimson liquid onto a pristine white handkerchief. Behind her, faint silhouettes of burning pyres flicker in the distance, casting long, dancing shadows that hint at the religious persecutions that defined her rule. The overall composition is designed to be both beautiful and unsettling, a visual representation of the complex and controversial figure of Mary I, forever remembered by her chilling nickname. The light source is positioned above and slightly to the left, casting dramatic shadows and highlighting the stark contrast between the queen's pale skin and the surrounding darkness. The image should evoke a sense of historical accuracy while subtly hinting at the reason for her infamous moniker.
