A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting two iconic 19th-century London landmarks: The Houses of Parliament and St. Pancras Station. The Houses of Parliament should be positioned on the left side of the 16:9 frame, showcasing its elaborate Gothic facade with pointed arches, ornate windows, and the iconic clock tower, Big Ben, prominently displayed. Use a pastel blue and grey colour palette for the stone, with subtle hints of gold leaf highlighting the architectural details. On the right side of the frame, illustrate St. Pancras Station, emphasizing its grand, red-brick Gothic Revival architecture. Depict the station's intricate facade, tall spires, and arched windows, using a pastel red and brown palette to capture the warmth of the brickwork. Connect the two landmarks visually with a stylised, winding River Thames in the foreground, rendered in shades of pastel blue and green. The sky should be overcast with soft pastel grey clouds, typical of London weather, enhancing the historical atmosphere. The composition should be balanced, ensuring that both landmarks are equally prominent and detailed, emphasizing their shared Gothic architectural style. The lighting should be soft and diffused, highlighting the intricate details of each building without harsh shadows. No text should be included in the image.
