A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic, watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central figure is a regal King, seated upon an ornate throne. He is dressed in traditional royal attire: a crimson robe trimmed with ermine, a golden crown adorned with subtle jewel accents, and a scepter held firmly in his right hand. Above the King's head, a radiant halo glows softly with a golden light, emanating outwards to illuminate his face. From the upper-center of the image, a beam of ethereal, pastel blue light descends, originating from a break in the clouds suggesting a divine source. This beam focuses directly onto the King's crown, symbolizing his divinely appointed authority. The background features a stylized, muted representation of the Houses of Parliament, rendered in pastel grey and blue tones, subtly blurred to indicate their secondary importance to the divine right. The overall color palette leans towards the colors of the UK flag: primarily reds, whites, and blues, rendered in soft, pastel shades to create a serene and authoritative atmosphere. The composition emphasizes the King's central position and the divine light, reinforcing the concept of divinely ordained rule. The style should evoke classical portraiture, lending a sense of historical gravitas and legitimacy to the scene.
