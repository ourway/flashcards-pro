A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a serene, dove-filled scene against a backdrop subtly colored with pastel blues and reds reminiscent of the UK flag. The central focus is a large, stylized olive branch, its leaves intricately detailed, arching protectively over a diverse group of people holding hands. These figures, representing various ethnicities and cultures, are dressed in simple, muted clothing, symbolizing unity and equality. The ground beneath them is verdant and fertile, suggesting peace and prosperity. In the far distance, partially obscured by a gentle mist, are faint outlines of iconic global landmarks – the Eiffel Tower, the Great Wall of China, the Statue of Liberty – subtly hinting at the international scope of the scene. Above, the doves are not flying randomly, but are ascending in a spiral pattern, creating a sense of upward movement and hope. The light source is soft and diffused, creating a peaceful, almost ethereal atmosphere. The overall composition should evoke a feeling of harmony, security, and the collective aspiration for a world free from conflict. The sky is a gradient of pastel blues and pinks, with no harsh lines or contrasts, to further enhance the feeling of serenity. The image should be 16:9 ratio and landscape orientation, with the main subject and idea mainly in the center of the image.
