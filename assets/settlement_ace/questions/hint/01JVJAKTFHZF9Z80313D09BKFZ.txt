A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting the UK Houses of Parliament, viewed from the outside, during a slightly overcast day. The color palette favors pastel blues, grays, and whites, subtly echoing the UK flag. The Palace of Westminster is the main subject, occupying the central area of the 16:9 landscape frame. In the foreground, two stylized, symbolic lions â€“ one golden and regal, representing the ruling party, comfortably seated on a stone plinth; the other, silver and alert, representing the opposition, crouching slightly below the first lion, as if ready to pounce. The silver lion is looking upwards at the golden lion with anticipation. The silver lion appears slightly leaner and more agile. Wisps of cloud drift above the Palace, partially obscuring the top of Big Ben's clock tower. The overall composition should convey a sense of watchful anticipation and readiness to challenge. There should be a green lawn in front of the Palace.
