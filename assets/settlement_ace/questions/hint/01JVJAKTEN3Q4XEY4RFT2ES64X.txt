A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic travel posters, depicting Edinburgh Castle majestically perched atop Castle Rock. The castle, rendered in hues of grey stone with accents of deep red on its battlements, dominates the central composition. From the castle's vantage point, the artwork should show a panoramic view extending towards the serene expanse of Loch Lomond. The loch, a tranquil body of water reflecting the soft, pastel colors of the sky (primarily light blues, pinks, and gentle whites), stretches into the background, dotted with small, verdant islands. The foreground should feature a gentle slope leading down from the castle, covered in heather in full bloom, its purple blossoms adding a splash of color. The sky above should be partially cloudy, with the sun gently filtering through, casting soft shadows across the landscape. Include subtle details such as the Scottish flag (Saltire) subtly waving from the castle's highest tower, and a few sailboats gently gliding on Loch Lomond. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades, with occasional vibrant accents to draw the eye to key features. The composition should emphasize the grandeur of the castle and the peacefulness of the loch, creating a harmonious and memorable image.
