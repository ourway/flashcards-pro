A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting the Houses of Parliament, focusing on a clear visual separation between the House of Lords and the House of Commons. The House of Lords is represented by a group of traditionally dressed Lords in red robes, standing within their chamber, signified by ornate, gothic architecture and gilded details. The House of Commons is similarly represented, filled with MPs in business attire, their chamber depicted with green benches and a more functional, yet still dignified, aesthetic. Between the two chambers, running directly through the center of the image, is a tall, impassable brick wall, colored in muted red and white, subtly evoking the St. George's Cross. Ivy climbs parts of the wall, suggesting its established and unyielding nature. A single, forlorn figure in a Lord's robe stands at the base of the wall on the Lords' side, gazing wistfully towards the Commons chamber, subtly conveying the inability to cross over. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and greens, creating a calming and educational atmosphere. The composition emphasizes the division and the static nature of the barrier, reinforcing the "False" answer to the question. The sky above is a soft, watercolor wash of blues and grays, indicative of a typical London day.
