A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical painting, depicting Oliver Cromwell on horseback during a break in battle. The scene should be set on a slightly elevated hill overlooking a vast landscape, merging the terrains symbolic of Dunbar and Worcester. Cromwell, the central figure, is portrayed in detailed military attire, his face etched with determination and resolve. His horse is a sturdy, war-ready steed, slightly sweating but standing firm. In the background, hint at the receding Scottish army in the distance, suggested by subtle details like scattered blue banners and fleeing figures, but without explicitly depicting violence or defeat. The sky above is a blend of stormy greys and blues, with a single ray of sunlight piercing through, illuminating Cromwell and his horse. The overall color palette should lean towards muted blues, greys, and browns, accented by the red of the English banners subtly placed in the background. The art style should evoke the feeling of a classic painting. The composition is vital: Cromwell and his horse should occupy the central space, commanding attention, while the background subtly hints at the battles and the retreating Scottish forces. The image should be rich in detail, from the textures of the uniforms to the landscape's undulations, creating a memorable visual association between Cromwell and his victories over the Scottish army. The image should be strictly 2D, without any text or numbers, and in a 16:9 landscape ratio, with the main subject centered within the frame.
