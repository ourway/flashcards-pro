A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image depicting the London skyline as a backdrop to a central, dynamic scene. The London Eye and Big Ben are subtly visible in the distance, rendered in pastel blues and grays. Dominating the foreground is a stylized Olympic torch, its flame depicted with swirling reds, oranges, and yellows, giving a sense of movement and energy. Around the base of the torch, five silhouetted figures are captured in mid-action, each representing a different Olympic sport: running, swimming, basketball, cycling, and gymnastics. These figures are not overly detailed but are easily identifiable by their poses. The overall composition is balanced, with the torch and athletes centered within the 16:9 ratio. The colors are primarily pastel, evoking a sense of celebration and remembrance, with subtle hints of red, white, and blue echoing the UK flag. The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish elements, and should look like a professional watercolour painting. The image aims to capture the spirit of the 2012 London Olympics, making it a memorable visual cue for the viewer. The sky above should be a soft, gradient blue, fading to a lighter hue near the horizon to give depth.
