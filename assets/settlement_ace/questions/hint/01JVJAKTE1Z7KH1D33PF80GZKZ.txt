A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting depicting the Houses of Parliament in London, bathed in a soft, pastel-toned morning light. The iconic clock tower of Big Ben stands prominently, its face indicating 10:00 AM. Above the entire parliamentary structure, subtly positioned and slightly translucent, floats a majestic crown, rendered in delicate golds, reds, and blues, echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The crown isn't physically resting on the building but hovers gently above, symbolizing the monarch's role as head of state. The River Thames flows gently in the foreground, reflecting the pastel colors of the sky and the Parliament building. Small, stylised rowing boats are visible on the river. The architectural details of the Parliament building are painstakingly rendered, emphasizing its historical significance and the democratic processes that occur within. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, with the crown centrally positioned above the parliament building, ensuring it is the focal point. The art style should evoke a sense of history, tradition, and stability, reflecting the UK's political system. The pastel color palette creates a calming and educational atmosphere, suitable for learning and memorization. No text should be included in the image.
