A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a solemn Scottish courtroom scene. The color palette leans towards muted blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the Scottish flag. Dominating the center of the image is a jury box filled with fifteen diverse individuals, each rendered with distinct facial features and expressions conveying attentiveness and civic duty. The jurors are dressed in everyday clothing, reflecting a cross-section of Scottish society. The background features a suggestion of a traditional Scottish courtroom with dark wood paneling and diffused light filtering through tall, arched windows. A subtle thistle motif is integrated into the wood carvings as a symbolic nod to Scotland. The overall composition is balanced and dignified, focusing on the collective responsibility of the jury. The style should be reminiscent of classical courtroom sketches, emphasizing realism and capturing the gravity of the judicial process. The absence of text or numbers is crucial; the visual emphasis is solely on the number of individuals comprising the jury.
