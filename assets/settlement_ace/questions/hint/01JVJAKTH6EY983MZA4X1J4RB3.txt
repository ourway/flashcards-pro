A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, showcasing the Palace of Westminster and Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) as the focal point. The scene is set along the River Thames, with the river flowing gently in the foreground. The Houses of Parliament should be depicted with architectural accuracy, emphasizing its Gothic Revival style with intricate details in the stonework and windows. The Elizabeth Tower should be prominent, its clock face clearly visible, though without actual numbers displayed. The painting should capture the atmosphere of a slightly overcast day in London, utilizing a pastel color palette dominated by blues, grays, and soft reds reminiscent of the UK flag. Small boats should be visible on the river, adding a sense of scale and activity. In the background, hint at the presence of Westminster Abbey with the very top of the towers visible, but not the full building. The composition should be centered, drawing the viewer's eye directly to the Palace of Westminster. The overall feeling should be one of historical significance and governmental importance, but rendered in a gentle, educational, and visually appealing way. The image ratio is 16:9.
