A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vintage television set as the central focus. The television screen displays a blurred, but discernible, image suggesting a cityscape split into two halves, the left half vaguely resembling the architecture of Glasgow (e.g., the Glasgow Cathedral), and the right half hinting at London landmarks (e.g., the Houses of Parliament). Two stylized, curving radio waves, rendered in pastel blue, emanate from the top of the television, visually connecting the two halves of the cityscape image on the screen. The television is placed atop a wooden table draped with a cloth patterned with a subtle, repeating motif of thistles (symbolic of Scotland) and roses (symbolic of England). To the right of the television, a vintage-style notepad lies open, with a quill pen resting upon it. The notepad is subtly aged with slightly yellowed paper. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, reminiscent of the UK flag colors. The background is a soft, blurred wash of colors, suggesting a cozy, book-lined study. The overall composition should evoke a sense of historical importance and innovation, emphasizing the connection between Glasgow and London through early television technology. The illustration avoids any text or numbers, relying solely on visual cues to represent the answer.
