A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic watercolor style, depicting a symbolic tug-of-war across the English Channel. The English side features a majestic, crowned lion, its paws firmly planted on the white cliffs of Dover, pulling a thick rope made of intertwined red and white threads (colors of the English flag). The French side showcases a proud, golden fleur-de-lis, rooted in the rolling green hills of Normandy, also pulling the rope with determined force. The rope itself stretches taut across the water, with stylized waves crashing gently against its midpoint. Tiny ships, representing both English and French naval power, are scattered in the background, rendered in muted pastel blues and greys, adding depth and historical context. Above, a swirling, partially cloudy sky, colored in soft blues and whites, hints at the long and turbulent passage of time. The overall composition emphasizes the prolonged struggle and balanced power between the two nations, symbolizing the "Hundred Years War." The image should evoke a sense of historical significance and national identity, focusing on the visual representation of a lengthy conflict rather than specific battles or figures. The color palette should be predominantly pastel, with subtle hints of the UK flag's colors (red, white, and blue) to subtly reinforce the connection to British history.
