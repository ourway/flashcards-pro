A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9, depicting an elderly, regal woman (representing the monarch) seated in an ornate, high-backed chair within a room reminiscent of a historical British study. The colour palette should be pastel, with some elements resembling the UK flag colours (red, white and blue). She should have a kind, wise expression, with silver hair neatly styled. Before her stands a younger individual, dressed in contemporary business attire, symbolizing a government official/member of parliament. The younger person leans slightly forward, attentively listening to the monarch. The study is filled with symbolic elements: a globe rests on a stand to the side, hinting at global affairs; a partially visible stack of books suggests knowledge and experience; a single beam of sunlight (yellow/gold) streams in from a tall window, illuminating the pair. Her hand is raised gently in a gesture of offering advice, but not instructing. The overall composition should evoke a sense of respectful counsel and guidance, with the monarch's posture communicating wisdom and the younger individual's posture conveying receptiveness. The image should be detailed, with attention paid to the textures of the fabrics and the subtle nuances of facial expressions, all rendered in a soft, pastel watercolor style. The background should be slightly blurred to keep the focus on the two figures.
