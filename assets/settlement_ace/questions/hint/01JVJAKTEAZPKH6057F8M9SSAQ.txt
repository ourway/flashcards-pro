A watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting two separate figures under a stormy, overcast sky. On the left, a man stands with a forceful posture, his face partially obscured by shadow, suggesting internal conflict. He is dressed in muted, dark clothing. On the right, a woman stands with her back to the man, turned slightly away, her arms wrapped around herself as if seeking protection. She is dressed in soft, pastel-colored clothing, symbolizing vulnerability and purity. A visible, symbolic barrier, like a cracked glass pane or a shattered mirror, separates the two figures, emphasizing the violation of trust and consent. Rain falls heavily around them, creating a somber and reflective mood. The overall color palette leans towards blues, greys, and soft pinks, evoking a sense of unease and sadness, yet also hinting at hope and resilience. The background is blurred to keep the focus on the two figures and the symbolic barrier, enhancing the message that consent is paramount, regardless of relationship status, and that any violation of that consent constitutes a serious crime. The composition should draw the eye to the space between the figures, highlighting the broken connection and the importance of respecting personal boundaries.
