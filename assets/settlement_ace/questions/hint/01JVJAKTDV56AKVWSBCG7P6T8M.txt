A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour painting in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic concert posters, depicting a grand concert hall interior. The colour palette should lean towards pastel blues and reds, evoking the British flag without directly replicating it. In the center of the hall, on a brightly lit stage, a full orchestra is performing, their instruments gleaming under the spotlight. The conductor, positioned prominently, is frozen mid-gesture, his baton forming a distinct, stylized figure-eight shape in the air. This "eight" is emphasized through a subtle gradient of light, making it the focal point of the image. The audience, filling the hall, is depicted as a sea of blurred faces, suggesting the vastness and popularity of the event. Above the orchestra, suspended from the hall's ornate ceiling, are eight glowing orbs, each emitting a soft, warm light, further reinforcing the "eight-week" duration. The overall composition should convey a sense of grandeur, sophistication, and the enduring appeal of classical music in the UK. The background should be slightly blurred to keep focus on the orchestra and the figure eight formed by the conductor's baton.
