A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh. The building should be centrally framed within the 16:9 landscape ratio. The architectural style should be accurately represented, emphasizing its modern design elements and the integration of natural materials. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, soft reds, and muted whites, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag without being overtly patriotic. Light should gently illuminate the building, casting soft shadows to accentuate its form.

In the foreground, subtly incorporate symbols of accessibility and welcome: a stylized open doorway, a pathway leading directly to the entrance, and a small, stylized brochure stand with pamphlets. The surrounding landscape should feature stylized Scottish flora, such as thistles and heather, adding a touch of local flavor. In the far background, hint at the Edinburgh skyline with soft, blurred outlines of iconic landmarks. The overall composition should evoke a sense of openness, invitation, and the ease of access, visually reinforcing the idea that tours and visits are readily available. The artwork style is reminiscent of a detailed architectural rendering, but with the warmth and approachability of watercolor, making it both informative and aesthetically pleasing.
