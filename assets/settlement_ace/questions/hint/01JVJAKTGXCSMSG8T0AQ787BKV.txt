A watercolor illustration in a realistic style, ratio 16:9, depicting a stylized, grand European Parliament building rendered in pastel blue and white hues. The building's architecture evokes a sense of unity and collaboration, with a large, central dome reminiscent of historical European landmarks. From the windows of the Parliament building, pastel-colored soundwaves emanate outwards, visually representing the voices of the people. These soundwaves, in varying shades of pastel pink, purple, and yellow, spread across a landscape filled with miniature, diverse figures of people from across Europe, all looking towards the Parliament. Each figure is distinctly drawn to represent various ethnicities and cultures. The landscape is dotted with iconic European landmarks in miniature form, such as the Eiffel Tower, the Colosseum, and Big Ben, subtly suggesting the geographical diversity of Europe. The sky above is a soft gradient of pastel blues and pinks, creating a serene and unified atmosphere. The overall composition emphasizes the connection between the people of Europe and their representatives in the Parliament, symbolized by the emanating soundwaves. The absence of any text focuses the viewer's attention on the visual mnemonic of voices emanating from the Parliament, representing "Members of the European Parliament."
