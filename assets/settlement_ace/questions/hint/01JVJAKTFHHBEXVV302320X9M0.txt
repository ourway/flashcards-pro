A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical painting, depicting the arrival of William of Orange in England. The scene unfolds on a bright, pastel blue hued, windy day at the coast of a southeastern town in England, with white cliffs in the background. William of Orange, dressed in shining, pastel orange and gold armor, stands tall on the beach as he disembarks from a Dutch ship adorned with orange flags and banners. His posture exudes confidence and determination. A group of English Protestants, dressed in fine clothing with subtle red accents, kneels before him, their faces filled with hope and admiration. Above them, the sky is a swirl of pastel blue and white, with a break in the clouds revealing a radiant, golden light shining down upon William and the welcoming Protestants, symbolizing divine approval and the dawn of a new era. The sea is rendered in shades of pastel green and blue, with gentle waves lapping at the shore. The overall composition should convey a sense of peaceful transition and the anticipation of positive change, reflecting the bloodless nature of the Glorious Revolution. The art style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and grandeur, similar to classical paintings of significant historical events.
