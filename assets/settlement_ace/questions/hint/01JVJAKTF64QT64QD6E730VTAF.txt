A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant Welsh landscape under a pastel sunrise sky. The foreground features a lush green valley dotted with traditional Welsh cottages with slate roofs, their windows glowing warmly. A winding river, reflecting the pastel colors of the sky (primarily soft blues, pinks, and whites), flows through the valley. In the center of the image, slightly elevated for prominence, is a large, stylized hand giving a "high five". The hand is realistically rendered, but subtly incorporates the colors of the Welsh flag: red on the fingernails, white on the back of the hand, and green on the palm. Above the hand, five fluffy sheep are playfully leaping in the air, seemingly celebrating the high five. The overall composition emphasizes the beauty and tranquility of Wales while subtly reinforcing the number "5" through the sheep and the hand gesture, acting as a mnemonic device. The pastel colour palette creates a calming and memorable visual association for the learner, avoiding any harsh or distracting elements.
