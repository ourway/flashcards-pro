A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic, watercolor style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus depicts a rugby match on a classic English pitch, bathed in soft, diffused daylight. On the left side, a team of "Cavaliers" is shown. These characters are depicted with flowing, long hair reminiscent of the era, wearing ornate, royal blue jerseys. Plumes adorn their helmets, and their expressions are haughty but determined. On the right side, the "Roundheads" are positioned. They have short, bowl-cut hairstyles, and wear simple, crimson red jerseys. Their faces are stern and resolute. The rugby ball is mid-air, a deep brown color, symbolizing the conflict. The background is a picturesque English countryside, with rolling green hills and a distant, hazy blue sky. The color palette primarily uses pastel shades of blue, red, and green, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag without being overtly patriotic. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of historical reenactment combined with a friendly sporting competition, creating a memorable visual connection between the Cavaliers, the Roundheads, and the English Civil War.
