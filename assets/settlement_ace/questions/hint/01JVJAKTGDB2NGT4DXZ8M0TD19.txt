A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting St. Andrew holding a saltire (the St. Andrew's Cross). The background features a serene Scottish landscape with rolling green hills, a loch reflecting the sky, and a distant, mist-shrouded mountain range. St. Andrew is portrayed as a kind, elderly man with a flowing white beard, wearing simple, historically accurate robes in muted blues and grays. The saltire he holds is a vibrant, diagonally oriented white cross against an azure blue sky. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, greens, and grays, reminiscent of the Scottish flag and landscape. A subtle halo of soft light surrounds St. Andrew’s head, but it's not overly emphasized. The focus is on the clear depiction of the saltire and its association with the saint. At the base of the image, small thistles, the national flower of Scotland, are scattered among the grass. The composition emphasizes the verticality of St. Andrew and the diagonal lines of the cross, creating a dynamic yet balanced image. The art style should avoid cartoonish elements, aiming for a lifelike representation with careful attention to detail in the folds of the clothing, the texture of the landscape, and the expression on St. Andrew’s face. The image should evoke a sense of peace, reverence, and the historical significance of St. Andrew as the patron saint of Scotland.
