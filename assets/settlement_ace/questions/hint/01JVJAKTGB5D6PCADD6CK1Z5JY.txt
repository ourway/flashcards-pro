A meticulously hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic, watercolor style, depicting two distinct scenes subtly blended together. The color palette should be primarily pastel, with underlying hints of red, white, and blue to subtly evoke the UK flag. The image is in a 16:9 landscape format, with the main subjects centered. On the left side of the image, a shop counter is shown, with a person appearing to be in their 40s purchasing cigarettes. Behind the counter, partially obscured, is a young person who looks under 18, reaching for a pack of cigarettes. The shopkeeper's face is etched with a worried expression. The backdrop includes shelves stocked with various products, all rendered in soft pastel hues. On the right side of the image, a diverse group of people are walking in a park. One individual is visually singled out and pushed to the side by another, with a malicious expression on their face. The overall atmosphere should convey a sense of tension and injustice. The background features iconic British elements such as a red telephone box and a silhouette of the Houses of Parliament in the distance, painted in muted tones. The composition should suggest a narrative, subtly connecting the two scenarios as examples of criminal law violations. The style should be reminiscent of classic British watercolor illustrations, with delicate brushstrokes and attention to detail, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements.
