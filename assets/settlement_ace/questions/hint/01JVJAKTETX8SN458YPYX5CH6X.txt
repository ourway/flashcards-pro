A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style (16:9 landscape). The central focus is a grand, symbolic depiction of the French Revolution's impact on Anglo-British relations. A regal, yet distressed, British warship is positioned on the right side of the frame, its sails billowing, navigating turbulent, dark blue waters. The shipâ€™s colour palette consists primarily of navy blue, white, and touches of red, echoing the Union Jack. On the left side, a stylized, yet realistic depiction of the storming of the Bastille during the French Revolution is shown, with vibrant splashes of red, white, and blue dominating the scene. Smoke and debris rise dramatically, symbolizing the revolutionary fervor. A symbolic chain, rendered in tarnished silver, stretches tautly between the Bastille scene and the British warship, visually connecting the two events. The chain appears strained and on the verge of breaking, symbolizing the fractured relationship between Britain and France. The background features a soft, pastel-colored sky with swirling clouds, hinting at the uncertainty and upheaval of the era. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of historical significance and the interconnectedness of these pivotal events in European history, focusing on the consequence of the revolution which led to war with Britain. The image should be devoid of any text or numbers. The colour palette should lean towards pastel shades, interspersed with the strong reds, whites, and blues of the French and British flags.
