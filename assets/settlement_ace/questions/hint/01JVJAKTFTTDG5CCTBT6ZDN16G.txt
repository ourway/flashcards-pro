A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting the Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh. The building is bathed in soft, diffused light, emphasizing its architectural details. Surrounding the parliament building is a vast, sprawling landscape representing the areas where the Scottish Parliament has authority. This landscape is vibrant and overflowing with diverse elements: rolling green hills dotted with sheep, bustling cityscapes, serene lochs, and fields of blooming heather. However, a clearly defined, yet translucent, protective dome encompasses a central area above the Scottish Parliament. Inside this dome, miniature versions of iconic UK-wide symbols are visible: a tiny Big Ben, a miniature Houses of Parliament, and a minuscule representation of the British financial sector. The dome represents the authority that is reserved to the UK Parliament and the Scottish Parliament's limitations. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades, with greens and blues dominating the landscape and the dome having a slightly rosy hue. The sky above is a blend of pale blue and soft grey, suggesting a typical Scottish day. The overall composition emphasizes the vastness of the Scottish Parliament's domain while acknowledging the defined boundaries of the UK Parliament's reserved powers.
