A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Stonehenge under a pastel-colored, pre-dawn sky. The color palette should lean heavily on soft blues, pinks, and purples, evoking a sense of mystery and ancient wonder. The central focus is a detailed rendering of the iconic stone circle, with each megalith rendered to show its texture and weathering, emphasizing its age and historical significance. The stones should appear slightly damp with dew, reflecting the soft light of the emerging dawn. Around the base of the stones, short, wild grasses are visible, painted in muted greens and browns to give a sense of the natural landscape. In the background, a gently rolling landscape stretches out, disappearing into the hazy horizon, suggesting the vastness of Salisbury Plain. The sky above Stonehenge should transition from a deep indigo at the top to a pale lavender near the horizon, with a few wispy clouds tinged with the first light of dawn. The overall composition should be balanced and symmetrical, drawing the viewer's eye to the center of the stone circle and conveying a sense of calm and timelessness. The art style should avoid any cartoonish or abstract elements, aiming for a realistic depiction that captures the grandeur and mystery of Stonehenge.
