A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a scene that juxtaposes the Crusades and the Hundred Years' War. The composition is split vertically, with the left side representing the Crusades and the right side representing the Hundred Years' War. The left side features a knight in shining armor, adorned with a red cross, kneeling in prayer before a stylized depiction of Jerusalem in the background. The scene is bathed in warm, golden light, symbolizing religious fervor. The right side shows English longbowmen in a defensive formation, facing an unseen enemy. Their banners bear the three lions of England. The background is a stylized French countryside, with medieval castles in the distance. This side is rendered in cooler, muted tones, reflecting the long and arduous nature of the conflict. A subtle mist hangs in the air, adding to the atmosphere. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with hints of red and blue reminiscent of the UK flag subtly incorporated into the clothing and banners. The sky above is a soft gradient of blue and white, unifying the two scenes. The image should convey a sense of historical weight and the distinct characteristics of each conflict. There should be no text in the image.
