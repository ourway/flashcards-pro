A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic British illustration, depicting the Houses of Parliament (Westminster Palace) bathed in the soft, diffused light of a London morning. The scene focuses on the interior of the House of Commons, rendered in pastel shades of blue, red, and cream, echoing the traditional colours of the UK flag and parliamentary decor. Dominating the foreground is an oversized, antique quill pen, poised above a stack of parchment scrolls tied with a navy blue ribbon. The quill is intricately detailed, with visible feather barbs and a polished silver nib. The parchment scrolls are slightly unfurled, revealing densely written text in elegant calligraphy, suggesting the detailed record of parliamentary proceedings. Emanating from the scrolls are faint, radiating lines of light, symbolizing the voice and authority of the official record. The background shows blurred, indistinct figures of parliamentarians in traditional attire, adding depth and context without distracting from the main subject. The overall composition is balanced and symmetrical, with the quill and scrolls centered within the 16:9 aspect ratio. The art style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and the importance of parliamentary record-keeping, using soft, watercolour-like textures to create a visually appealing and educational image.
