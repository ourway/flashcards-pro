A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour painting depicting the Union Flag of the United Kingdom as its central focus. The flag should appear slightly windswept, giving it a sense of dynamism and life. The colour palette should strictly adhere to the flag's traditional colours: vibrant red, crisp white, and deep blue, arranged accurately to showcase the superposition of the crosses. Dominating the composition are three distinct, symbolic elements subtly overlaid, yet clearly distinguishable, upon the flag's respective crosses. Firstly, a red rose, representing England and St. George's Cross, should be gently superimposed, almost translucent, onto the central red cross. Secondly, a thistle, the national flower of Scotland and representative of St. Andrew's Cross, should be delicately placed over the white diagonal cross. Lastly, a shamrock, symbolising Ireland and St. Patrick's Cross, should be similarly overlaid on the remaining red diagonal cross. The fourth potential cross should be absent, replaced by negative space, or a subtle, faded grey tone. The background should be a soft, overcast sky in pastel blues and greys, evoking a typical British weather scene. The overall art style should be detailed and realistic, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements. The image ratio should be 16:9, with the main subject centered. The artwork should aim for a classic, timeless feel, reminiscent of vintage educational illustrations.
