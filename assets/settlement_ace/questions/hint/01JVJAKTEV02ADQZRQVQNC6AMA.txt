A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic storybook illustrations. The scene is set in a stylized, idealized Scottish countryside, with rolling green hills under a pastel blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. In the center of the image, a kilted Scottish gentleman with a neatly trimmed beard and a slightly melancholic expression is depicted. He is wearing a traditional kilt in muted, earthy tones. He sits at a rustic wooden table, on which a partially disassembled haggis sits in a ceramic bowl. Next to it is a bowl filled with coarse oatmeal. The gentleman is in the act of chopping a large, glistening onion with a cleaver, his eyes watering slightly. Tears stream down his face, but it's clear that the tears come from cutting the onion and not from sadness. The oatmeal bowl is overflowing, with some grains scattered on the table. The color palette should predominantly feature pastel shades of blue, green, and beige, accented by the reddish-brown hues of the haggis and the golden tones of the oatmeal. The overall composition should evoke a sense of gentle nostalgia and rustic charm, subtly hinting at the key ingredients of haggis – onions and oatmeal – through the gentleman's actions and surroundings. The background should be softly blurred to keep the focus on the central figure and the table setting.
