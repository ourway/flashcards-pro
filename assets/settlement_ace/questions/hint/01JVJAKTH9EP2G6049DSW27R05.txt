A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, capturing the essence of 18th-century British politics. The scene unfolds across a 16:9 landscape canvas, dominated by two central figures representing the Whigs and Tories. On the left, a distinguished gentleman embodying the Whig party stands confidently, attired in deep blue coat and breeches, a nod to the Whig's association with liberty and reform. He holds a scroll, symbolic of constitutional principles. His gaze is directed towards the center, reflecting progressive ideals. On the right, his Tory counterpart stands firm, clad in a rich red coat, representing the Tory's traditionalist stance and loyalty to the crown. He holds a miniature model of a grand estate, symbolizing land ownership and established order.

Between them, a stylized, almost allegorical representation of the British Parliament is depicted in the background. It is not a literal depiction, but a symbolic representation of the Parliament. The colours should either resemble the UK flag or be in a pastel colour palette. The overall composition should be balanced, with the two figures evenly spaced and the Parliament serving as a unifying backdrop. The art style should evoke the elegance and formality of 18th-century portraiture, whilst remaining accessible and educational. The image should be devoid of any text or numbers, relying solely on visual cues to convey the emergence of the Whigs and Tories in the 18th century.
