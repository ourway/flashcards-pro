A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in watercolor style (16:9 landscape). The central subject is a portrait of a determined, yet thoughtful Ernst Rutherford, depicted as a younger man, circa the 1930s, with neatly combed hair and spectacles perched on his nose. He is not directly holding anything. Behind him, filling the central space of the image, is a stylized depiction of an atom model, specifically Bohr's model, with electrons orbiting a central nucleus. The electrons and nucleus are rendered in soft pastel blues and reds, reminiscent of the UK flag colors, but in a muted, scholarly palette. The atom model is slightly blurred as if in motion, suggesting the dynamic energy within. The background transitions from a subtly textured parchment color near Rutherford to a slightly darker, almost sepia tone at the edges, hinting at the historical importance of the scene. The overall style should evoke a sense of scientific discovery and academic rigor, avoiding any harsh or overly dramatic elements. The lighting is soft and diffused, highlighting Rutherford's face and the atom model without casting strong shadows. Emphasis is on clarity and detail, ensuring the image serves as a clear visual mnemonic. Rutherford's expression should convey intelligence and focus, but also a hint of the weighty responsibility of his work.
