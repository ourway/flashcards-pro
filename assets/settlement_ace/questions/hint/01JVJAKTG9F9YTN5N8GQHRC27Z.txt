A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a regal Henry VIII standing centrally, radiating power and authority. He is dressed in opulent Tudor attire, rich in reds, golds, and deep blues, reminiscent of the royal colors. Behind him, split into two distinct halves, is a symbolic representation of his historical significance. To Henry's left, visualize a grand, crumbling Roman Catholic cathedral, its architectural details reflecting its former glory but now showing signs of decay and separation. Cracks run through the structure, symbolizing the break with the Church of Rome. To Henry's right, illustrate six individual, uniquely designed wedding rings displayed in a vertical row. Each ring should be distinct in its style, reflecting the diverse stories of his marriages. The background should fade into a soft, pastel blue sky, providing a calming contrast to the dramatic events depicted. The composition should guide the viewer's eye towards Henry VIII, emphasizing his central role in these pivotal historical events. The overall tone should be educational and informative, avoiding any caricature or disrespectful portrayal. The watercolor technique should lend a soft, historical feel, making the image both visually appealing and memorable.
