A 16:9, landscape-oriented, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting a dramatically lit courtroom scene. The color palette leans heavily on pastel blues and reds reminiscent of the UK flag, with subtle creams and grays adding depth. In the center, a young woman stands bravely, bathed in a soft, hopeful light filtering from a high window. She is dressed in simple, modern clothing. To her left, a stern-faced judge sits elevated on a bench, subtly framed by the Union Jack flag hanging discreetly behind him. He holds a gavel, poised but not striking, symbolizing the power of the law. To the right of the woman, looming in shadow, is a figure representing coercion, partially obscured and faceless, symbolizing the hidden nature of forced marriage. The courtroom itself is detailed with traditional British architectural elements: wainscoting, arched windows, and sturdy oak furniture. The overall composition aims to convey a sense of justice, protection, and the serious legal consequences associated with forced marriage in the UK. The scene should evoke a feeling of empowerment for victims and a clear message that such practices are criminal offenses, focusing on the strength of the law to defend individual liberties.
