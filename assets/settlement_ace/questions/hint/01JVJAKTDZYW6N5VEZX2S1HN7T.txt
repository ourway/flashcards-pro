A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Welsh Assembly Building (Senedd) in Cardiff Bay. The building should be bathed in the soft, warm light of a late afternoon sun, casting gentle shadows that highlight its architectural details. In the foreground, a group of diverse individuals, representing the people of Wales, are gathered in a semi-circle, attentively listening to a speaker. The speaker is an archetypal "Assembly Member" (AM) â€“ a person of authority and knowledge, dressed in professional attire but with a friendly and approachable demeanor. The colour palette of the image should follow the colours of the Welsh flag, with a prominent use of red, white, and green. A subtle, stylized dragon emblem, a symbol of Wales, should be integrated into the background. The dragon should be very subtle and not be the main focus of the image. The overall composition should be balanced and harmonious, creating a sense of unity and civic engagement. The style should evoke the feel of a classic children's book illustration, making the image educational and engaging. The image should convey the idea of elected members representing the people of Wales in their national assembly.
