A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant and flowing United Kingdom flag, the Union Jack, rippling gently in a breeze. The flag dominates the center of the 16:9 landscape composition, its colors rendered in precise detail, mirroring the exact shades of red, white, and blue. Overlaid subtly onto the flag, almost as if woven into its fabric, is a faint, translucent image of the outlines of the constituent countries of the UK: England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, illustrating the "union" aspect. The background features a soft, pastel blue sky with subtly rendered, fluffy white clouds that are not distracting. The overall aesthetic leans towards a classic, educational illustration style, reminiscent of historical textbooks, with an emphasis on clarity and accuracy. The Union Jack should appear slightly aged or weathered, suggesting history and tradition. The color palette should be primarily based on the colors of the UK flag, but with variations in tone and saturation to create depth and visual interest. The overall impression should be one of national pride, unity, and historical significance, without being overly sentimental or propagandistic. The style should avoid cartoonish or abstract elements, remaining faithful to a realistic depiction.
