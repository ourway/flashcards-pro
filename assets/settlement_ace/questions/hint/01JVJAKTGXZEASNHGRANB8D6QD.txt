A meticulously detailed, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting King James I overseeing the creation of a large, ornate book. King James I, dressed in regal attire with a red cloak and gold crown, sits at a grand oak table. The table is covered with a rich, blue velvet cloth. On the table lies the "Authorised Version" Bible, bound in dark red leather and adorned with gold leaf patterns. Several scholars with quill pens and parchment surround him, diligently working on the translation. Sunlight streams through a stained-glass window, casting colorful patterns on the scene. The window depicts the royal coat of arms, subtly incorporating the colors of the UK flag (red, white, and blue). In the background, a grand library with towering bookshelves filled with ancient texts is visible. The overall color palette should be dominated by rich reds, blues, golds, and browns, evoking a sense of history and authority. The art style should be reminiscent of classical portraiture, with a focus on realistic details and textures, capturing the solemnity and importance of the event. The composition should be balanced and symmetrical, with King James I at the center, emphasizing his role in authorizing the Bible. The scene should convey a sense of scholarly dedication and the enduring legacy of the Authorised Version.
