A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape format. The colour palette should be pastel, with shades of blue, red, and white reminiscent of the UK flag. The central image features a scene inside a vintage-style British laboratory, circa 1930s-1940s. The main subject is a distinguished-looking inventor with neat grey hair wearing a tweed suit and glasses, intensely focused on a small, boxy, early television set. The television screen displays a blurry, early broadcast image â€“ perhaps a simple geometric shape or a test pattern. Light from the television screen illuminates the inventor's face, casting a soft glow. Behind and slightly to the right of the inventor, partially visible through a large open window, is a side view of a sleek, early jet engine mounted on a test rig. Flames are subtly emanating from the engine's exhaust, suggesting power and innovation. The background should show the rolling green hills of the English countryside. The laboratory itself is filled with scientific instruments, wires, and blueprints, hinting at the creative and experimental atmosphere. The overall composition should convey a sense of British ingenuity and the dawn of a new technological era, creating a memorable visual link between the television, the jet engine, and British innovation. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.
