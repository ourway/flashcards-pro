A hand-drawn, realistic watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a festive Scottish scene. The focal point is a stylized thistle, the national flower of Scotland, rendered in shades of pastel purple and green. The thistle is not a single flower, but rather a collection of 30 individual thistle heads clustered together to subtly represent the '30th' of the date. The thistle arrangement sits atop a stylized calendar page, painted in light blue, with faint lines suggesting the days of a month. At the bottom of the calendar page, delicate pastel brown autumn leaves, rendered in a slightly faded style, are scattered, symbolizing November. A faint saltire (Scottish flag) watermark is subtly integrated into the background using light blue and white watercolour washes, adding a distinctly Scottish element. The overall composition should be soft and inviting, with a focus on natural elements and pastel colours, creating a mnemonic device to associate the thistle (Scotland), autumn leaves (November) and the quantity of thistle heads (30) with St. Andrew's Day. The style should evoke traditional botanical illustrations with a touch of Scottish romanticism.
