A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting depicting the four constituent countries of the United Kingdom as distinct, adjacent jigsaw puzzle pieces. England is represented by a classic, red brick courthouse with a traditional clock tower, slightly weathered, nestled within a green, rolling landscape. Scotland is depicted as a sturdy, grey stone courthouse reminiscent of Scottish baronial architecture, set against a backdrop of misty, purple heather-covered highlands. Wales is illustrated by a courthouse constructed from slate, its design echoing the rugged Welsh coastline, with a dragon emblem subtly incorporated into the building's design. Northern Ireland's puzzle piece showcases a courthouse with a blend of Georgian and Victorian architectural styles, surrounded by a lush, green landscape with a hint of rolling hills. Each courthouse has subtle differences in architectural style, color, and surrounding environment, emphasizing their distinct nature. The puzzle pieces are intentionally slightly misaligned, illustrating the lack of uniformity, with faint lines of separation visible between them. The color palette leans towards pastel shades of green, blue, grey, and red, reflecting the UK flag colors while maintaining a soft, educational tone. The sky above is a gentle gradient of pale blue and white, suggesting a calm, overcast day typical of the UK.
