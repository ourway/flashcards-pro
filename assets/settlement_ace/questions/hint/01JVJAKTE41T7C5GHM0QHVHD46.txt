A watercolour painting in a realistic style, ratio 16:9, depicting the scales of justice, but instead of being perfectly balanced, one side holds items representing childhood and adolescence, while the other displays symbols of the adult legal system, subtly tipping towards the childhood/adolescence side. The left side of the scale contains a stack of colourful books, a half-finished model airplane, and a musical instrument (recorder). The right side holds a miniature gavel, a bound legal document, and a small, symbolic prison cell. The backdrop shows a stylized, simplified outline of the UK, rendered in pastel blues and reds, with a soft, diffused light emanating from the center. Above the scales, a stylized, simplified illustration of the face of a young person, aged around 14, looking thoughtful and slightly concerned. The colour palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag, creating a calming and educational atmosphere. The composition should be focused, drawing the viewer's eye to the scales and the items they hold, visually representing the concept of a separate court for young people. The style should be reminiscent of classic children's book illustrations, aiming for clarity and a friendly tone.
