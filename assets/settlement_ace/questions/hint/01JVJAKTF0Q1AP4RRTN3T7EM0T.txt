A hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, soft reds, and creams, subtly referencing the UK flag. The central focus is a stylized depiction of two women, positioned side-by-side, symbolizing diverse career paths. The woman on the left is dressed in professional attire, perhaps a business suit, and is holding a briefcase. A faint, glowing outline of a baby appears near her, subtly suggesting motherhood, but without explicitly showing a child. She exudes confidence and determination. To the right, the second woman is similarly dressed in work clothes. A faint, glowing outline of a baby appears near her as well. The background behind the first woman features faint, abstract shapes representing skyscrapers and office buildings, rendered in pastel blues and grays. The background behind the second woman features faint, abstract shapes representing a laboratory and test tubes, rendered in pastel greens and yellows. The overall composition should convey a sense of balance and harmony, emphasizing that both women are successfully navigating their careers while also being mothers. The watercolor effect should create a soft, approachable feel, avoiding harsh lines or overly detailed features. The style should be realistic but with a gentle, artistic touch, emphasizing the diversity of women's choices and challenging the assumption that motherhood necessitates career cessation.
