A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting depicting a diverse group of people standing in a queue outside a traditional British polling station. The building is constructed from red brick, features a prominent clock tower, and is adorned with the UK flag subtly waving in the background. The queue is composed of individuals of various ethnicities, ages, and backgrounds, representing the multicultural nature of the UK. However, a translucent, ghost-like figure of a young boy (appearing under 18) and a woman without UK flag colours on her clothing (representing a non-citizen resident) are standing slightly apart from the main queue, partially faded, symbolizing their ineligibility to vote. The overall color palette should be pastel, with soft blues, reds, and whites reminiscent of the UK flag, creating a serene and thoughtful atmosphere. The composition should emphasize the contrast between the solid, vibrant figures in the main queue and the faded figures, highlighting the concept of who can and cannot participate in elections. The sky above is a gentle, watercolour wash of blue, and the surrounding environment includes subtle details like neatly trimmed hedges and cobblestone paving, grounding the scene in a quintessential British setting.
