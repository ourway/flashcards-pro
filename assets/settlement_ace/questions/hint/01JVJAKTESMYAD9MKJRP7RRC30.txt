A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical tapestry, capturing the essence of the Union Flag. The canvas is dominated by a centrally positioned Union Flag (16:9 ratio) with the crosses of St. George (England), St. Andrew (Scotland), and St. Patrick (Ireland) intricately woven into its design. The colour palette should be primarily pastel and inspired by the UK flag: red, white, and shades of blue. Around the flag, but still within the central composition, are subtle symbolic representations of the three patron saints. St. George is represented by a stylized, pastel red rose subtly intertwined with the flag's red cross. St. Andrew is represented by a pastel blue thistle, peeking out from behind the white saltire. St. Patrick is represented by a pastel green shamrock delicately placed near the red saltire. The background is a soft, diffused gradient of pastel blues and whites, evoking a sense of history and national identity. The overall composition should feel balanced and harmonious, with a slight emphasis on the interconnectedness of the three crosses, symbolizing the union of the nations. The art style is reminiscent of classic British heraldry, but with a softer, more approachable aesthetic suitable for educational purposes. No text or numbers should be included in the image.
