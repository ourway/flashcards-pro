A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style. The scene is set in a warmly lit, Victorian-era study, dominated by a large mahogany desk overflowing with manuscripts, inkwells, and quills. The color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, red and white, reminiscent of the UK flag, with accents of gold in the desk details. At the center of the composition, a focused Charles Dickens, dressed in a dark blue waistcoat and white shirt, is deeply engrossed in writing. His brow is furrowed in concentration as he meticulously crafts a sentence on a parchment. To the left of Dickens, a stack of his famous novels, including 'Oliver Twist' and 'A Tale of Two Cities,' is prominently displayed, their spines clearly visible. Instead of musical notes, the background features ghostly images of his iconic characters, like Oliver Twist and Ebenezer Scrooge, subtly woven into the wallpaper pattern. A single, muted red rose sits in a vase on the desk, symbolizing the beauty and depth of his literary works. The overall atmosphere should evoke a sense of literary genius and the intense focus required for crafting timeless novels, subtly contrasting with the idea of musical composition. The image should be 16:9 ratio.
