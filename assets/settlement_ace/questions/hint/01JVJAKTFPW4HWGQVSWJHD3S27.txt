A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The artwork depicts Saint David, the Patron Saint of Wales, in a serene, pastoral setting. He is shown as an elderly man with a kind face, wearing simple, light blue robes, reflecting the colors of the Welsh flag. He stands on a small, verdant hill in the center of the frame. Around his feet, daffodils, the national flower of Wales, bloom vibrantly in shades of yellow and white. A dove, symbolizing peace and the Holy Spirit, hovers gently near his right shoulder. In the background, rolling green hills stretch towards the horizon, dotted with traditional Welsh cottages with grey stone walls and slate roofs. A meandering river flows through the valley, reflecting the soft, pastel colors of the sky. The sky itself is a gentle blend of light blue and white, suggesting a calm, overcast day typical of the Welsh landscape. The overall composition emphasizes the saint's connection to nature and the Welsh countryside, reinforcing the association between St. David and Wales. The gentle colors and realistic style should evoke a sense of tranquility and reverence, aiding in memorization. The absence of any text ensures the focus remains on the visual mnemonic.
