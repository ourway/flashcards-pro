A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a bustling medieval English market scene, circa 14th century. The primary focus is on large, overflowing bales of wool, stacked high and dominating the center of the frame. The wool should appear soft, fluffy, and inviting, rendered in varying shades of cream, beige, and off-white. Market stalls surround the wool piles, showcasing other goods like pottery, wooden tools, and woven baskets, but these are less prominent. In the background, a weathered stone building with a sign indicating a merchant's guild is visible. Figures in period attire – merchants in tunics, farmers in roughspun clothing, and perhaps a noblewoman inspecting the goods – populate the market, engaged in trade and conversation. The sky should be a soft, overcast grey, characteristic of the English climate, with subtle hints of blue peeking through. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with muted blues, reds, and yellows accentuating the scene without overpowering the natural tones of the wool. The composition should guide the eye towards the central wool bales, emphasizing their importance as a key export. The scene should evoke a sense of historical authenticity and economic activity.
