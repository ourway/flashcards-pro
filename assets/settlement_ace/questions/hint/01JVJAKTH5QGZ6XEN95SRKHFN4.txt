A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a Scottish legal courtroom scene, bathed in soft, pastel hues of blue, red, and white, subtly reminiscent of the UK flag. The central focus is a jury box populated by fifteen individuals, each rendered with unique features and expressions, reflecting a diverse representation of Scottish society. They are all attentively listening to proceedings, their faces a mix of contemplation and seriousness. The courtroom itself is classically designed, with wooden paneling and subtle ornamentation, avoiding any overly modern elements. The judgeâ€™s bench is visible in the background, slightly blurred, with a gavel resting prominently. The overall composition should emphasize the unity and collective responsibility of the fifteen jurors. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating an atmosphere of solemnity and importance. The scene should evoke a sense of Scottish legal tradition and the vital role of the jury in the justice system. Avoid any cartoonish or abstract elements, maintaining a realistic and dignified portrayal of the subject matter.
