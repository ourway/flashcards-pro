A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting the interior of the Houses of Parliament in London. The colour palette should consist of pastel blues, reds and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag, creating a serene yet dignified atmosphere. The focal point is the green benches of the House of Commons, partially occupied by a diverse array of elected representatives, their faces showing expressions of attentive listening and occasional debate. Above them, the hammerbeam roof is visible, showcasing its intricate carved details. Light streams through the tall, arched windows, illuminating the scene with a soft, diffused glow, symbolizing transparency and openness. The composition should be balanced, with a slight emphasis on the central aisle leading to the Speaker's chair. In the foreground, a subtle suggestion of the Mace can be placed, representing the authority of Parliament. The overall impression should be one of order, reasoned discussion, and the democratic process in action, visually affirming that the British system of government is indeed a parliamentary democracy. The details should be precise and realistic, capturing the architectural grandeur and the human element of the parliamentary process, without cartoonish or abstract elements.
