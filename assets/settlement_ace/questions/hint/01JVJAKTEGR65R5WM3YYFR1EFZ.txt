A watercolour painting in a realistic style, depicting a split scene representing the complexity of voting rights for EU citizens in the UK. The canvas is horizontally divided. On the left side, rendered in a warm, inviting pastel yellow, a group of diverse individuals, clearly identifiable as EU citizens through subtle symbolic elements like a small EU flag pin on one person’s lapel, are cheerfully casting votes into a ballot box adorned with local election symbols (city council logo, for instance). The ballot box is overflowing, symbolizing active participation. On the right side, the scene shifts to a cooler pastel blue. The same group of EU citizens is now standing outside a polling station during a General Election. The polling station is flying a large Union Jack flag. The EU citizens are looking on with expressions of restrained disappointment, their hands clasped or in their pockets, subtly conveying their inability to participate in this particular election. A single spotlight brightly illuminates the left side, drawing the viewer’s eye to the active participation, while the right side is cast in softer, diffused light, suggesting exclusion. The overall composition aims to convey a sense of nuanced access rather than complete denial, hinting at the partial voting rights of EU citizens.
