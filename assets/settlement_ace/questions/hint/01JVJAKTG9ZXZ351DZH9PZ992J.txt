A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical map illustrations. The scene depicts the island of Great Britain, viewed from above, with a clear delineation between England and Scotland. England is bathed in a warm, golden hue, suggesting Roman influence and prosperity. Roman soldiers, rendered in detailed miniature, march across the English landscape, constructing roads and settlements. The Scottish lowlands are partially touched by this golden light, with Roman infrastructure present but less pronounced. As the landscape transitions into the Scottish Highlands, the color palette dramatically shifts to cool blues, greens, and purples, representing the untamed and unconquered territory. The Highlands are depicted as rugged and mountainous, with scattered Pictish settlements. No Roman soldiers or infrastructure are visible in the Highlands. Instead, fierce-looking Pictish warriors, painted with woad and brandishing spears, stand guard on the mountain peaks. A subtle, ethereal mist shrouds the Highlands, further emphasizing their mystique and inaccessibility. The overall composition focuses on the geographical divide and the visible absence of Roman influence in the northernmost regions of Scotland, with the colours resembling the UK flag, and the scene rendered in a soft, pastel colour palette. The image should have a 16:9 aspect ratio. The main subject and idea should be mainly in the center of the image.
