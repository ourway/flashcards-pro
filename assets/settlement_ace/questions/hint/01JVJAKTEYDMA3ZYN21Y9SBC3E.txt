A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a vibrant, healthy potted shamrock plant, representing the Northern Ireland Assembly. The shamrock, overflowing with lush green leaves, sits in a terracotta pot adorned with subtle Celtic knot patterns. Gentle sunlight streams through a partially open window, illuminating the plant and casting soft shadows. The sill is painted in pastel blue, reminiscent of the UK flag. A watering can, also pastel red, rests beside the pot, suggesting ongoing care and nurturing. Above the shamrock plant hovers a translucent, protective dome, symbolizing the UK government, but it is clearly not closed or restricting the plant's growth; instead, it's positioned to indicate support and shelter. The background is a soft, out-of-focus pastoral scene of rolling green hills and a clear blue sky, evoking the Northern Irish landscape. The overall color palette should be pastel and calming, with greens, blues, and reds harmonizing to create a serene and reassuring image. The artistic style should be realistic and detailed, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements, to emphasise the idea of the plant's continued vitality and the Assembly's ongoing function.
