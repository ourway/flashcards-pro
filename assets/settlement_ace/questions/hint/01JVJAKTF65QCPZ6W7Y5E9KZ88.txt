A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic, 2D watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The scene depicts a serene, pastel-colored, Middle Eastern landscape at dawn. In the center, a kneeling figure representing Ibrahim, dressed in simple, flowing white robes, faces upwards with an expression of profound faith and submission. A young boy, representing his son, stands calmly beside him, his face also reflecting trust and acceptance. Above them, a celestial light shines down, illuminating a gentle, white ram descending from the heavens. The ram is depicted as a symbol of divine intervention and mercy. The background features rolling sand dunes transitioning into a soft, pink-tinged sky. Subtle, stylized representations of minarets and traditional Middle Eastern architecture are visible in the far distance, rendered in muted blues and creams. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, pink, cream, and gold, creating a sense of peace, reverence, and divine grace. The composition emphasizes the central figures and the descending ram, highlighting the theme of sacrifice and divine intervention. The art style should be reminiscent of classical religious illustrations, focusing on realistic depictions and emotive expressions to convey the weight and significance of the event. Avoid any harsh lines or overly dramatic shading; instead, prioritize soft, flowing lines and gentle color transitions to evoke a sense of spiritual solemnity.
