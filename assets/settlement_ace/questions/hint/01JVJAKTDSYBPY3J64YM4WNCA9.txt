A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D illustration in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The color palette leans towards the pastel shades of blue, red, and white, echoing the UK flag. The central image depicts a valiant English knight, clad in shining (but slightly worn) armor, standing between two distinct scenes. To the knight's right, a stylized depiction of a Crusades-era battlefield unfolds. Suggest the Holy Land with muted desert tones, crusader flags bearing the St. George's Cross, and simplified silhouettes of opposing forces clashing. The overall tone is one of religious fervor tempered with the grim reality of war. To the knight's left, visualize a scene representing the Hundred Years' War. Rolling green hills of the English countryside transition into the war-torn fields of France. English longbowmen are strategically positioned, arrows flying towards distant, silhouetted French soldiers. A medieval castle in the background, partially ruined, symbolizes the long and arduous conflict. The knight himself looks weary but determined, his gaze fixed on the viewer. His armor has subtle details showing wear and tear to suggest the passage of time and the hardships of war. The composition emphasizes the two distinct conflicts, with the knight serving as a bridge between them, visually linking the Crusades and the Hundred Years' War as key historical events involving England during the Middle Ages.
