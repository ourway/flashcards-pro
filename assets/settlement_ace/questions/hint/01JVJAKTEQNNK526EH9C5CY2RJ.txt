A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style (not cartoonish or abstract), depicting the iconic Court of Session building in Edinburgh, Scotland. The building should be central in the 16:9 landscape composition. The colour palette should resemble the UK flag, using reds, whites, and blues in a pastel shade. The architectural details of the Court of Session should be rendered with precision, emphasizing its grandeur and historical significance. Subtle blue hues could wash over the stone facade, creating a sense of solemnity and importance. The Scottish flag (Saltire) flies subtly and artistically atop the building, rendered in soft blues and whites. Framing the Court of Session in the background are the gently rolling hills of the Scottish landscape, painted in muted greens and browns. In the foreground, a symbolic representation of justice: a set of scales, delicately balanced, with a thistle (the national flower of Scotland) subtly entwined around one arm, and a stylized legal scroll on the other. The scales should be rendered in a burnished bronze color, contrasting with the softer colors of the background. The overall composition should evoke a sense of Scottish heritage, legal authority, and the weight of civil justice being administered in the heart of Edinburgh. The sky should be a soft, watercolor blend of whites and light blues, suggesting a typical Scottish overcast day. The image should be free of any text, numbers, or explicit symbols, relying solely on visual cues to represent the Court of Session and its significance.
