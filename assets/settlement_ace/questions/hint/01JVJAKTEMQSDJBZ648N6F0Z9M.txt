A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical tapestry. The scene depicts a serene, windswept Scottish highlands landscape under a vast, pastel-blue sky. Dominating the center of the frame is a large, stylized saltire (diagonal cross) rendered in pure white. The cross is not merely geometric; subtle textures and brushstrokes give it the appearance of hand-carved wood, aged and weathered by time. At the intersection of the cross's arms, a faint, almost ethereal image of a thistle, the national flower of Scotland, is visible. The highlands themselves are painted in muted greens and browns, with touches of heather in bloom, adding subtle purples and pinks. The composition is centered, emphasizing the saltire against the expansive sky. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, whites, and earthy tones, evoking a sense of peace, history, and Scottish identity. The style of the drawing should feel old and historical, similar to an illustration found in a medieval manuscript, with a focus on realistic textures and lighting. No text is present in the image.
