A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image in a realistic style, depicting the interior of the House of Commons during a secret ballot election for the Speaker. The scene is bathed in soft, pastel blues and creams, reminiscent of the UK flag's color palette. Dominating the center is a stylized, oversized ballot box crafted from polished dark wood, featuring a discreet slot at the top. Around the ballot box, silhouetted figures of MPs are queuing patiently, each holding a folded ballot paper. The faces of the MPs are intentionally obscured to emphasize anonymity. Soft light filters through the high, arched windows, casting gentle shadows that highlight the solemnity of the occasion. A single, ornate quill pen rests beside the ballot box, symbolizing the act of voting. The overall composition is balanced and symmetrical, with the ballot box as the clear focal point. The background includes subtle details of the House of Commons architecture, such as wood paneling and rows of empty green benches, to create a sense of place without distracting from the main subject. The image aims to visually represent the secret nature of the ballot and the democratic process involved in selecting the Speaker.
