A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration depicting a stylized, symbolic representation of the Crimean War, set against a pastel-colored backdrop reminiscent of a vintage map. In the center, a British lion, rendered in soft pastel blues and whites, stands defiantly opposite a Russian bear, colored in muted reds and creams. The lion wears a miniature naval hat. The bear wears a traditional Russian Ushanka hat. Between them, a stylized, pastel-colored rendering of the Black Sea churns gently, with miniature, simplified warships (British ships slightly larger and more numerous) sailing on it. The coastline on the left (British side) is dotted with rolling green hills and white cliffs, subtly hinting at the British landscape. The coastline on the right (Russian side) features snow-capped mountains and dense forests, all rendered in a soft, painterly style. Above the scene, two intertwined ribbons, one blue and one red, symbolize the opposing forces. The overall composition should be balanced and serene, avoiding any depiction of violence or aggression, but rather focusing on the historical and geographical context of the conflict. The art style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and educational value, with detailed rendering and careful color choices.
