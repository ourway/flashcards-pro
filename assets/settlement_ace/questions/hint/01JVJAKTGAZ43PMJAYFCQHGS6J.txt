A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style. The scene depicts a vibrant, sunlit Irish landscape, predominantly in pastel greens and blues, reminiscent of the Irish flag. In the center, a symbolic Celtic knot, intricately designed, forms the shape of the island of Ireland. The southern portion of the knot, representing Southern Ireland, is glowing with a soft, golden light, visually separating it from the rest of the knot. Rising above the glowing Southern Ireland section is a flock of doves, symbolizing peace and independence, ascending towards a clear, blue sky. The background features rolling green hills dotted with traditional Irish cottages and grazing sheep. A winding river flows through the landscape, reflecting the sunlight and the vibrant colors of the scene. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, with a sense of hope and new beginnings. The art style should evoke a sense of historical significance and cultural pride, emphasizing the beauty and serenity of the Irish countryside. The color palette should be soft and inviting, creating a memorable and emotionally resonant image. The image ratio should be 16:9.
