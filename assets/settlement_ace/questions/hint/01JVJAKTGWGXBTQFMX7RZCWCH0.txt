A meticulously hand-drawn 2D image, watercolor style, portraying two distinct scenes connected visually. On the left side of the 16:9 canvas, a friendly, diverse group of people surrounds a table inside a warmly lit, inviting office space, representing the Citizens Advice Bureau. A kind-faced advisor is depicted offering assistance, perhaps pointing to a document or listening attentively. The office has subtle elements like a bookshelf filled with neatly organized files and a welcoming sign. The color scheme here leans towards pastel blues and greens, creating a sense of calm and accessibility. On the right side, a classic, slightly grand solicitor's office is depicted. A formally dressed solicitor sits at a large wooden desk, engaged in a discussion with a client. Law books line the walls, and a framed portrait of a historical legal figure hangs subtly in the background. Here, the color palette shifts to deeper blues and reds, with touches of gold, evoking a sense of authority and expertise. Connecting these two scenes is a gentle, winding path of pastel blue, symbolizing the journey of seeking legal advice. This path visually links the accessible help of the CAB to the professional guidance of a solicitor, emphasizing that both are valid options. The overall composition balances accessibility with professionalism, using a realistic art style and avoiding any text to create a memorable visual mnemonic.
