A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, capturing the iconic moment of Bobby Moore, the captain of the 1966 English World Cup-winning team, holding the Jules Rimet trophy aloft. Moore should be depicted at the center of the 16:9 landscape composition, with a triumphant expression. The background should feature a stylized Wembley Stadium bathed in the golden light of victory, with cheering crowds depicted as blurred, pastel-colored figures to maintain focus on Moore. The color palette should primarily consist of the colors of the UK flag: red, white, and blue, subtly integrated into the scene. For example, the stadium seats could subtly fade from white to blue to red upwards. Moore should be wearing the classic white England jersey, with the red England crest prominently displayed. The Jules Rimet trophy should be rendered with gleaming gold and intricate detailing. Include symbolic elements like a subtle, stylized lion rampant emblem subtly woven into the stadium architecture, representing England's national animal. The overall art style should evoke a sense of nostalgia and national pride, reminiscent of classic commemorative illustrations. The composition should be balanced to draw the viewer's eye to Bobby Moore and the trophy, symbolizing his leadership and the team's victory.
