A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a solemn courtroom scene in Northern Ireland. The color palette leans towards pastel blues and reds, subtly echoing the UK flag. Dominating the center of the 16:9 landscape composition is a distinguished District Judge, seated behind a sturdy, dark wood bench. The judge, a figure of gravitas and wisdom, is depicted with a kind, yet discerning expression; he is wearing a traditional black robe. A small, ornate sign reading "District Court" rests discreetly on the front of the bench. Before the judge, a petitioner presents a minor case, illustrated by a symbolic, small, cracked vase resting on a table. The courtroom is subtly detailed with wainscoting, and a single, muted stained-glass window depicting a Celtic knot design is visible in the background. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet authority, fairness, and careful consideration. The illustration is designed to be educational, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements, and focusing on a realistic portrayal of the Northern Irish legal system.
