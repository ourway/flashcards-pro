A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a classic cricket scene evoking the spirit of the Ashes series. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly referencing the UK flag. Dominating the central composition is a cricket pitch rendered with lush green grass. A batsman, wearing traditional white cricket attire with a subtle English rose emblem on his chest, is poised mid-swing, bat raised high, facing a bowler from the Australian team, identifiable by a small Southern Cross emblem on his shirt. In the background, a crowd of spectators is faintly sketched, adding depth and atmosphere. Above the pitch, suspended as if a celestial object, is a delicately rendered urn, radiating a soft, ethereal glow. Fine details include the texture of the cricket bat, the stitching on the cricket ball, and the subtle shadows cast on the pitch. The artistic style should capture the elegance and historical significance of the Ashes, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements. The overall impression should be one of sporting rivalry, tradition, and national pride, designed to visually link the image with the concept of cricket matches between England and Australia. The image ratio is 16:9, landscape orientation, with the main subject in the center.
