A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a grand, stylized compass rose, its points oriented towards the cardinal directions, each subtly representing a different European nation's architectural style. The compass is rendered in a pastel color palette, leaning towards blues and creams. From the center of the compass, three distinct scrolls unfurl outwards. The first scroll, colored a soft blue, features a series of interlocking gears, symbolizing regulations. The second scroll, in a gentle pink hue, displays a delicate framework of interconnected branches, each leaf representing a different area of policy, to visualize framework decisions. The third scroll, in a pastel yellow, shows a series of arrows pointing in the same direction, symbolizing directives. The background consists of a faded map of Europe with the countries outlined in a light grey. The edges of the map are blurred, giving the impression of antiquity. The overall composition is balanced, with a focus on clarity and symbolic representation, ensuring the image serves as a memorable visual mnemonic for the three types of European laws. The art style should lean towards realism, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and the colors used should evoke a sense of unity and cooperation.
