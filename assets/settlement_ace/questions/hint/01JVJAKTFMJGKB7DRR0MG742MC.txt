A hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a nighttime scene centered around the Houses of Parliament. The color palette should lean towards deep blues and reds, reminiscent of the UK flag, with accents of warm orange and yellow to highlight the fire and explosions. The Houses of Parliament should be the central focus, rendered with meticulous detail, showcasing its iconic clock tower and gothic architecture. In the foreground, a shadowy figure representing Guy Fawkes is seen in profile, his face partially obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. He is standing near barrels of gunpowder, which are subtly glowing with an ominous light. Above the Houses of Parliament, a stylized, controlled explosion of fireworks bursts in the sky, forming symbolic shapes like stylized "1605" or a phoenix rising from the ashes. The overall composition should convey a sense of historical drama and intrigue, with the contrast between the dark night and the vibrant fireworks creating a visually striking and memorable image. The art style should be reminiscent of classic historical illustrations, aiming for a balance between accuracy and artistic expression, ensuring that the image is both informative and aesthetically pleasing.
