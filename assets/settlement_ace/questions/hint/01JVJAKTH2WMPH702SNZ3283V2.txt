A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image depicting a Roman legionary, his armor slightly tarnished and weathered, standing forlornly on a windswept, grassy cliff overlooking the churning, grey waters of the English Channel. The legionary's gaze is fixed towards the distant, misty horizon, suggesting a departure or farewell. His shield, emblazoned with the SPQR emblem (rendered subtly and artistically), leans against a weathered Roman milestone that is partially obscured by overgrown ivy. At the base of the cliff, a partially ruined Roman villa suggests the decline of Roman influence. Dominating the center of the composition is a stylized, ancient wooden door, slightly ajar, revealing a path leading away from the cliff and towards a sunlit, open field dotted with early spring wildflowers. Ten small wildflowers are clustered near the door, symbolizing the 'ten' in 'four-ten'. The overall color palette should lean towards muted blues, greys, and greens to evoke a sense of melancholy and the passage of time, with subtle hints of faded red and gold in the legionary's attire and the SPQR emblem. The art style should be realistic but with a painterly, illustrative quality, reminiscent of historical illustrations found in antique books. The sky should be overcast, with just a hint of light breaking through the clouds, illuminating the open field, symbolizing a new beginning after the Roman departure. The composition should be balanced, with the legionary and the door forming the focal points, drawing the viewer's eye and creating a lasting visual association with the event.
