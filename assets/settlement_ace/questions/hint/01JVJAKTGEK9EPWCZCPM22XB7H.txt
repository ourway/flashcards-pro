A picturesque, watercolour-style landscape depicting a Scottish Hogmanay celebration at twilight. The scene should focus on a group of diverse individuals, young and old, standing in a circle, hands joined, in a town square reminiscent of Edinburgh. They are illuminated by the warm glow of street lamps and the soft light emanating from nearby windows. The background features iconic Scottish architecture, including a distant view of Edinburgh Castle silhouetted against the fading sky. The colour palette should be dominated by blues, purples, and greys of the twilight sky, contrasted with the warm yellows and oranges of the artificial light. The figures should be dressed in a mix of contemporary and traditional Scottish attire, such as tartan scarves and hats. Snow gently falls, adding a sense of serenity and festivity to the scene. In the center of the circle, subtly placed on the cobblestones, should be a slightly aged scroll with faint musical notes hinting at a song being sung. The overall composition should evoke a sense of nostalgia, community, and the passing of time, subtly alluding to the "Auld Lang Syne" theme. The style should resemble a classic watercolour painting, with soft edges and delicate brushstrokes, avoiding any sharp lines or overly modern elements. The mood should be peaceful and reflective, capturing the essence of a shared cultural tradition.
