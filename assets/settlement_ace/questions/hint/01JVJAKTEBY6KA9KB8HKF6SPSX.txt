A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a softly lit scene of a traditional Hanukkah celebration. The central focus is a detailed, ornate silver menorah holding eight lit candles, each flame rendered with a warm, flickering glow using pastel yellows, oranges, and reds. Around the menorah, arrange symbolic elements: a stack of golden, perfectly round latkes on a delicate china plate, their surfaces subtly glistening with oil; a dreidel spinning on a polished wooden surface, showcasing the Hebrew letters with muted blues and browns; and a scattering of chocolate gelt coins wrapped in shiny gold foil, hinting at the festive gift-giving tradition. The background should feature a warmly lit, inviting home interior, with a hint of a window showing a dark blue night sky dotted with faint stars, evoking the miracle of the oil lasting eight nights. Use a pastel color palette dominated by soft blues, creams, and golds, with subtle accents of red reminiscent of the UK flag, to create a calming and memorable visual association with the eight-day duration of Hanukkah. The overall style should be realistic and detailed, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, making it visually appealing and educational.
