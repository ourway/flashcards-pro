A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolour painting in a realistic style, depicting James Watt standing proudly next to a significantly improved steam engine. The engine is rendered with intricate detail, showcasing its polished brass and iron components, various valves, pipes, and a large, rotating flywheel dominating the scene. Steam gently billows from the engine's various outlets, subtly animated with a soft, translucent quality. Watt, dressed in late 18th-century attire – a dark coat, breeches, and a powdered wig – holds a set of calipers in his right hand, as if he has just taken a precise measurement. His expression is one of quiet satisfaction and scientific curiosity. The backdrop features a stylized representation of a British industrial landscape in the early stages of the Industrial Revolution: factories with smoking chimneys in the distance, but also elements of the natural landscape – rolling green hills and a winding river – to emphasize the transformative impact of steam power on the British countryside. The primary colours are a pastel palette, with shades of blue, beige and cream, with touches of copper and light browns to give the impression of the steam engine. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, with the steam engine and Watt positioned centrally, drawing the viewer's eye to the heart of the technological innovation. The style is reminiscent of historical scientific illustrations, aiming for clarity, precision, and an understated elegance that reflects the significance of Watt's contribution to British industry and innovation.
