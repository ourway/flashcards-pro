A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a symbolic bridge spanning a verdant valley. The bridge itself is constructed from large, grey stones, reminiscent of medieval architecture. On the left side of the bridge, representing Wales, is a field of vibrant daffodils, the national flower, gently swaying in a breeze. On the right side, symbolizing England, a cluster of Tudor roses blooms profusely. At the center of the bridge, subtly etched into the keystone, is a stylized Roman numeral VIII, representing Henry VIII. The valley below the bridge is a patchwork of rolling green hills, dotted with small, traditional Welsh cottages on the left and quaint English villages on the right. The sky above is a soft pastel blue, with fluffy white clouds that mirror the shapes of the daffodils and roses. The overall color palette leans towards the red, white, and blue of the Union Jack, with muted tones to give a historical feel, but also incorporating the green and yellow of the Welsh landscape. The composition focuses on the bridge as a central unifying element, emphasizing the connection between the two lands. The entire scene evokes a sense of peace, unity, and historical significance, designed to visually represent the unification of Wales and England during Henry VIII's reign.
