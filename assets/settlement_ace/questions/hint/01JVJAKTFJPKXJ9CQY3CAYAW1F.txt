A watercolor illustration, in a realistic style, depicting a vintage-style television set, reminiscent of those from the mid-20th century, with a warm, inviting glow emanating from its working half. The television is centrally positioned against a soft, pastel blue background. The right half of the television screen displays a vibrant, colorful scene of the British countryside: rolling green hills, a meandering river reflecting the sky, and a scattering of sheep. This scene is rendered with meticulous detail, capturing the essence of rural Britain. Conversely, the left half of the television screen is completely black, conveying the concept of darkness and visual impairment. A subtle gradient effect transitions from the vibrant, colorful scene to the stark blackness, symbolizing the partial loss of vision. The television itself is a dark wood color, with chrome accents around the screen and knobs. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with blues, greens, and yellows dominating the vibrant half of the screen and stark black dominating the other. The intention is to create a serene and memorable image, associating the concept of half (50%) with the visual representation of partial sight loss, specifically in the context of a television, thereby acting as a visual mnemonic for the discount on the television license fee.
