A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a large, gently rolling green field, representing England. Dominating the field is a giant, stylized number "84," crafted from interwoven wildflowers in pastel shades of blue, red, and white, echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The "8" is formed by a continuous loop of forget-me-nots, while the "4" is shaped from a vibrant cluster of poppies. The field extends towards a soft, pastel-colored sky, dotted with fluffy, white, sheep-shaped clouds. In the far distance, barely visible on the horizon, are three small, stylized hills, each representing one of the other UK countries: Scotland (a thistle-covered hill), Wales (a daffodil-covered hill), and Northern Ireland (a shamrock-covered hill). These hills are significantly smaller and less prominent than the expansive English field, visually emphasizing the proportional difference in population. The overall tone should be serene and educational, designed to evoke a sense of the English countryside and the numerical dominance within the UK, with the floral "84" acting as a memorable visual anchor. The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish elements, and maintain a sense of gentle artistry.
