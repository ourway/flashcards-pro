A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical watercolor painting. The scene depicts a bustling town square in 18th-century England. The color palette leans heavily on pastel shades of blue, red, and white, subtly referencing the Union Jack. The focal point is a slightly elevated speaker's platform. Standing on the platform is a well-dressed gentleman in a powdered wig and red coat, addressing a crowd. The crowd is composed predominantly of men, all similarly attired in the fashion of the era, some holding walking sticks or top hats. The men are of varying ages, but each is well-groomed and appears prosperous. In the foreground, a stone wall serves as a visual barrier, behind which stand a group of women and men who look poor, separated from the men who are allowed to vote. The women are dressed in simpler attire, and their expressions convey a mixture of curiosity and disappointment. The men behind the wall are wearing old clothes. The background features quintessential English architecture, including a church spire and half-timbered buildings. The overall composition emphasizes the separation and exclusivity of the voting process at the time. The style should be realistic and detailed, akin to an illustration from a historical textbook, with careful attention paid to the clothing, architecture, and facial expressions to convey the historical context and the limited suffrage of the era. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a sense of historical authenticity.
