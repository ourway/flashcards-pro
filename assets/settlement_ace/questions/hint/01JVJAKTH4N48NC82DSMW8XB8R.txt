A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting a stylized "British Invasion" of music, rendered in a realistic style. The central focus is a dual scene: On the left, a microphone stands prominently on a stage bathed in warm, golden light, a snake-like shadow coiled around it, subtly alluding to the Rolling Stones' iconic imagery. The stage is awash in hues of red and black, reminiscent of their rock anthems. To the right, four stylized mop-top silhouettes stand together in a recording studio filled with pastel blue and yellow light, each holding a different instrument (guitar, bass, drums), representing The Beatles' early days. Musical notes flow upwards from both scenes, merging in the center to form a stylized Union Jack flag, symbolizing their British origin and influence. The background features a collage of vintage concert posters with abstract shapes, hinting at the transformative impact of their music on global culture. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and yellows, creating a vintage, nostalgic feel, while the realistic drawing style ensures clarity and recognizability. The composition balances the two bands, emphasizing their equal contribution to British musical heritage, and avoids any text or numbers, relying solely on visual storytelling.
