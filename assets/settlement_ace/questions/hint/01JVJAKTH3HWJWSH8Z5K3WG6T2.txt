A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration depicting a scene of Viking longboats approaching the British coastline in AD 789. The artwork should capture the essence of a historical raid with an educational focus. The longboats, rendered with realistic detail and pastel-colored sails (primarily blues and creams), are cutting through a turbulent, teal-colored sea. Each boat is filled with Viking warriors, clad in historically accurate, yet subtly colored armour (grey with pastel blue accents), brandishing axes and shields. The British coastline in the background is a soft green, dotted with small, thatched-roof villages. Smoke rises subtly from one village, suggesting the start of the raid, but avoiding any depiction of violence or destruction. A sense of foreboding hangs in the air, created by the stormy sky above, rendered in shades of grey and pastel blues. The overall composition places the longboats as the central focal point, emphasizing their approach towards the vulnerable British shores. The art style should lean towards realism, avoiding cartoonish elements, and should use a pastel color palette to create a visually appealing and historically informative image. The image should be 16:9 and landscape orientation, with the main subject in the center.
