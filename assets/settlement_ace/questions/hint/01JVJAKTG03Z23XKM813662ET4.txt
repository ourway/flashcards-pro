A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting two distinct scenes subtly connected by a shared pastel color palette. On the left side, occupying roughly half the image, a pastoral Scottish landscape unfolds under a soft, diffused sunlight. A gentle, rolling green hill dominates the foreground, upon which a small, realistically rendered Dorset sheep stands. Emanating from the sheep, in a soft, glowing outline, is a ghostly, translucent double, symbolizing cloning. The double is almost identical but slightly fainter, suggesting its replicated nature. The background features a loch reflecting the sky, with distant, hazy purple mountains completing the tranquil scene. On the right side, the image transitions to a bustling, stylized depiction of a British high street. A red telephone box and a black cab are subtly placed in the background. In the foreground, an ATM (cash machine) is embedded in a brick wall of a building. A hand is shown withdrawing bank notes from the ATM. The bank notes are pastel shades of blue, pink, and green, subtly linking the colours to the Scottish landscape. The overall composition uses a pastel colour palette that evokes a sense of calm and innovation. A faint, barely visible dotted line connects the sheep on the left to the ATM on the right, suggesting the link between British innovations. The art style is realistic and detailed, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and the watercolor technique gives the image a soft, educational feel. The ratio is 16:9.
