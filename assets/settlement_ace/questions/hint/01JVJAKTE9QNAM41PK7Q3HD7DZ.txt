A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting the western regions of Great Britain. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, subtly incorporating the red, white, and blue of the UK flag. The artwork should avoid being cartoonish or abstract. The central focus is a split scene: On the left, a rugged, mountainous Scottish landscape is depicted, complete with a lone, ancient stone tower perched atop a hill, a symbol of Scottish resilience, and wild heather blooming in the foreground. To the right, a similarly formidable Welsh landscape unfolds, showcasing rolling green hills, a traditional Welsh cottage nestled in the valley, and a proud Welsh Dragon emblem subtly incorporated into the hillside using the natural contours and vegetation. Dividing these two landscapes is a symbolic, stylized representation of ancient boundary markers, weathered stones bearing faint Celtic knotwork patterns. The sky above Scotland is a blend of soft blues and whites, suggesting a clear, crisp day, while the sky over Wales is a gentle, warm sunset, casting a golden glow over the hills. The composition uses depth and perspective to emphasize the vastness and enduring nature of these regions. The overall mood is one of peaceful strength and cultural pride, visually representing the regions that remained free from Anglo-Saxon rule.
