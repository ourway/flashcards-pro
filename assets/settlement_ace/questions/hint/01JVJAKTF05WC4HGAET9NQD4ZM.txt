A meticulously hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration, 16:9 landscape ratio, depicting a serene British park scene in pastel colors. The central focus is a circular park fountain with clear, gently cascading water. Around the fountain, families are enjoying picnics, children are playing, and individuals are reading books on park benches. The colour palette should be pastel. Dominant shades are light blues, soft greens, and gentle pinks to resemble the UK flag.

Subtly placed near the fountain, but not directly in the foreground, is a small, elegant sign depicting a red circle with a diagonal line through a stylized bottle and glass, symbolizing "no alcohol." The sign is integrated seamlessly into the park environment, appearing as a standard informational marker. The park itself is meticulously detailed with various species of trees typical to the UK. Winding pathways meander through the park, connecting different areas.

In the background, a classic British red telephone box is visible, adding a touch of iconic UK imagery. The composition should evoke a sense of tranquility, order, and community well-being. The watercolor technique should be realistic, capturing the soft textures of grass, stone, and foliage. The overall impression is one of a pleasant, regulated public space where alcohol consumption is restricted to maintain a peaceful atmosphere.
