A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Palace of Westminster bathed in the soft, pastel hues of dawn. The composition is centered, focusing on the iconic buildingâ€™s facade. Instead of the traditional UK flag colours, a pastel colour palette is used to give a sense of calm and inclusion. Emanating from the Palace are diverse silhouettes of individuals, stylistically similar to stained glass figures, each representing a different faith. The figures are symbolic, not literal depictions of religious people. One silhouette shows a figure in prayer beads, another in a hijab, another with a kippah, and another with a turban, and a final figure in a simple robe. These figures are arranged symmetrically, radiating outwards, suggesting that the light of parliament shines on all faiths equally. The overall mood should be one of inclusivity, harmony, and the celebration of diverse faiths within the British peerage system. The sky above the Palace should be a blend of soft pastel pinks, blues, and purples, reflecting the dawn of a new era of religious tolerance and equality. The image should evoke a sense of respect and dignity.
