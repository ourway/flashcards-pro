A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic storybook art. The composition is centered within a 16:9 landscape format. The scene depicts a gently rolling, green Scottish hillside under a soft, pastel blue sky. In the foreground, a group of children are gathered around a large, ancient oak tree. The children are diverse in appearance, reflecting the multicultural makeup of modern Scotland. They are dressed in simple, contemporary clothing in pastel colours ( light blues, greens, yellows and pinks). Underneath the oak tree, several adults (also in pastel colours) are seated at a round, wooden table, engaging in a calm and supportive discussion with one of the children. The adults are dressed in smart-casual attire, conveying a sense of professionalism and approachability. Symbolic elements include a small, blue Scottish flag gently waving from the top of the oak tree, representing Scotland. The tree itself symbolizes strength, growth, and protection, reflecting the supportive nature of the Children's Hearings system. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a warm and reassuring atmosphere, highlighting the caring environment. The overall tone is peaceful and optimistic, focusing on the well-being and future of the children. The colours should lean towards a pastel palette, but incorporate subtle hints of blue, white, and red to subtly echo the UK flag without being overt.
