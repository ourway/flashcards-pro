A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a scene within a Northern Irish courtroom. The palette leans towards the pastel shades of blue and white, reminiscent of the UK flag. The central focus is a District Judge and a Deputy District Judge seated at a raised bench. The District Judge, an individual with a kind, wise face, is shown in formal judicial robes. Next to him sits the Deputy District Judge, looking attentively towards the courtroom. Subtle details suggest their qualifications and compensation: a stack of legal documents bound in red tape rests on the bench near the Judge, symbolizing the extensive legal training and knowledge required for the position. A small, ornate scale of justice is subtly placed on the bench, reflecting the fairness and integrity of the legal system, further reinforcing their paid positions. The background includes a blurred view of the courtroom, with faint outlines of people representing the public and legal professionals. The light filtering through a stained-glass window in the background casts a soft glow on the scene, creating an atmosphere of solemnity and respect. The overall composition should convey a sense of order, authority, and the professional nature of the judicial roles in Northern Ireland.
