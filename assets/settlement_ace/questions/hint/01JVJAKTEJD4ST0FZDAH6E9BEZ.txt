A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image depicting a grayscale, almost sepia-toned, suburban street scene in the early 1960s in Britain. The houses are terraced, with neatly kept gardens. A black and white television antenna sits atop one of the houses. A woman in a modest, knee-length dress and sensible shoes is hanging washing on a line in her backyard. A man in a suit and hat is polishing a classic car from the 1960s in the driveway. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet conformity and traditional values. However, in the very centre of the image, superimposed and slightly transparent over the existing scene, is a vibrant, almost dream-like swirl of pastel colors (pinks, blues, yellows, and greens) suggesting the social changes happening behind the scenes. Within the pastel swirl, hint at abstract shapes representing elements of the "Swinging Sixties" â€“ a fragment of a mini-skirt, a record player, the silhouette of a dancer. The contrast between the muted, conformist background and the vibrant, superimposed swirl of change should visually represent the counter-cultural movement and hint at the period of social change that was the Swinging Sixties. The 16:9 ratio focuses the eye on the contrast in the center, emphasizing the concept of change occurring.
