A hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting a vibrant recycling ecosystem in a stylized, educational manner. The central focus is a large, stylized recycling symbol, composed of three arrows chasing each other in a circular motion, rendered in shades of pastel blue, white, and light red. Inside the recycling symbol, various discarded materials are being transformed into new products. On the left side of the symbol, depict old newspapers dissolving into pulp, which then flows towards the top of the symbol to become fresh, clean paper rolls. On the right side, show crushed aluminum cans melting down and being molded into new, shiny beverage cans. At the bottom, illustrate broken glass bottles being melted and reformed into beautiful, new glass jars. The background should fade from a darker, earth-toned green at the bottom to a lighter, sky-blue at the top. Subtle, almost ethereal lines should emanate from the recycling symbol, suggesting energy conservation. The overall style should be realistic but with a touch of whimsy, creating an engaging and memorable visual representation of the recycling process and its benefits. Soft pastel colours should dominate the palette, evoking a sense of environmental responsibility and positive change. The composition should be balanced, with the recycling symbol prominently displayed in the center and the transformation processes clearly illustrated around it, creating a cohesive and informative image.
