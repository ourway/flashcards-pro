A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting the iconic O2 Arena in Greenwich, London, rendered in a realistic style. The O2 Arena should be the central focus, its distinctive dome shape dominating the composition. The colors should lean towards a pastel palette, with the dome reflecting hues of light blue and pale yellow, reminiscent of a sunrise. Around the base of the O2, illustrate a bustling scene with stylized figures representing diverse concert-goers, their clothing hints at various musical genres. Delicate watercolor washes should create a sense of movement and energy. In the background, subtly suggest the historic architecture of Greenwich, with faint outlines of the Royal Observatory and the Cutty Sark, rendered in muted grey tones. The River Thames should be visible in the foreground, reflecting the pastel colors of the sky and the O2. Small, stylized musical notes should float around the O2, visually symbolizing its function as a music venue. The overall feeling should be cheerful and celebratory, capturing the essence of Greenwich as a hub of entertainment and culture, with the O2 at its heart.
