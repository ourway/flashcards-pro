A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration depicting a scene representing the departure of English kings from France in the 1450s. The art style should evoke a medieval tapestry, with a realistic yet slightly romanticized feel. In the center, a regal English longship, adorned with a stylized royal standard bearing a simplified version of the three lions, sails away from a French coastline. The coastline features a medieval French castle rendered in soft, pastel yellows and oranges, with its flag (fleur-de-lis symbol) waving gently in the breeze. On the ship, a sorrowful-looking king, dressed in royal blue robes, gazes back at France. Dominating the foreground is a symbolic broken sword lying on the deck of the ship, representing the end of English rule. The sky above is a blend of soft blues and greys, hinting at a somber mood. The sea is rendered in shades of teal and light blue, with gentle waves suggesting a peaceful departure rather than a forced retreat. Incorporate subtle details such as seagulls flying overhead and the texture of the wooden ship to enhance the realism and historical atmosphere. The overall color palette should lean towards muted blues, reds, and golds, reminiscent of the UK flag while maintaining a soft, watercolor aesthetic. The composition should emphasize the ship's departure, visually conveying the idea of leaving and the end of an era.
