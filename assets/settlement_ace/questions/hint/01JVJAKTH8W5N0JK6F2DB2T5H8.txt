A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a bustling Victorian-era port scene. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, red, and white, subtly echoing the UK flag. In the center of the 16:9 canvas, a grand, arched gateway made of stone stands open, symbolizing the abolition of taxes. The gateway is adorned with subtle carvings of sheaves of wheat and gears, representing agriculture and industry respectively. Through the gateway, ships laden with goods from various countries are visible, their sails billowing in the wind. On the docks in the foreground, merchants in Victorian attire are actively engaged in trade, exchanging goods with each other. Some are smiling and shaking hands, conveying a sense of prosperity and ease of trade. The background features iconic Victorian buildings, such as warehouses with cranes and smokestacks emitting gentle puffs of smoke. The sky is soft and overcast, typical of the British climate, with a hint of sunlight breaking through, illuminating the open gateway. The overall composition emphasizes the flow of goods and the sense of open access, conveying the idea of free trade facilitated by the removal of taxes. The image should evoke a feeling of optimism and economic activity, reinforcing the concept of the Victorian government promoting free trade through the abolition of import taxes.
