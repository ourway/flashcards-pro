A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the Welsh countryside under a vibrant, pastel-colored sky. Rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep dominate the landscape. In the foreground, a stylized, oversized Welsh dragon, its scales rendered in shades of pastel red and white, playfully interacts with a group of 60 daffodils, arranged in a loose cluster. The dragon is gently nudging one daffodil away from the group with its snout, creating a visual separation. In the background, a subtle, almost dreamlike representation of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament building) can be seen, its architectural details softened by the watercolor medium. The overall composition should evoke a sense of calm and idyllic Welsh life, with the specific number of daffodils (60) acting as a visual mnemonic against the incorrect number (160) from the original question. The colour palette leans heavily on pastel shades of red, white, green, and yellow, subtly referencing the Welsh flag and creating a visually harmonious and memorable scene. The painting should not include any text or numbers.
