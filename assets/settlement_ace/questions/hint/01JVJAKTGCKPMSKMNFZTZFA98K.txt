A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting six figures, each distinctively representing a founding Western European nation of the EU. The figures should be arranged in a semi-circle, suggesting unity and collaboration. Each figure is dressed in attire representative of their nation's traditional clothing or a recognizable cultural symbol: France (a beret), Germany (lederhosen), Italy (a gondolier hat), Belgium (waffles), Netherlands (tulips), and Luxembourg (wine). They are standing around a table upon which six national flags have been laid down. On the table is a blueprint with the word "EUROPA" written in a calligraphic font. The entire scene is bathed in a soft, warm light, emanating from a central point above the table, highlighting the collaborative nature of their endeavor. The background features a subtle blend of pastel blues and yellows, reminiscent of a hopeful dawn, symbolizing the birth of the European Union. Overall, the image should convey a sense of historical significance, cooperation, and optimism, visually representing the 'Six-strong EU' laying the foundation for the European Union.
