A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a lavishly set Christmas dinner table, bathed in the warm glow of candlelight. Dominating the table is a large, golden-brown roasted turkey, presented whole on a silver platter. The turkey is realistically rendered, showcasing its plumpness and crispy skin. Around the turkey are arranged classic Christmas side dishes: cranberry sauce in a crystal bowl, a steaming dish of Brussels sprouts, roasted potatoes glistening with oil, and carrot and parsnip mash. The tablecloth is a crisp white linen, embroidered with subtle holly leaf patterns in a pastel green. Elegant silverware and crystal glasses are placed neatly around the plates. Behind the table, a blurred background hints at a cozy dining room with a decorated Christmas tree, its lights twinkling softly. The color palette leans towards warm golds, reds, greens, and browns, evoking a sense of festive cheer and traditional British Christmas celebrations. The overall style should be realistic and detailed, avoiding cartoonish elements, and reminiscent of a classic Christmas illustration. The image should convey abundance, warmth, and the quintessential British Christmas dinner, with the turkey as the undisputed centerpiece.
