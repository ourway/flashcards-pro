A whimsical, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the River Thames snaking through a stylized representation of London. The river is a vibrant blue, reflecting a pastel-colored sky with fluffy white clouds. Along the banks of the Thames, arrange 33 distinct, miniature, pastel-colored townhouses, each slightly different in architectural style, representing the 33 local authorities. Group these townhouses loosely into clusters, suggesting different boroughs. The overall composition should be balanced and aesthetically pleasing, with the townhouses visually distinct but harmoniously integrated into the London landscape. In the background, subtly include iconic London landmarks such as the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye, rendered in soft, pastel shades. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel blues, pinks, yellows, and greens, evoking a sense of calm and sophistication. The river should dominate the foreground, leading the eye towards the townhouses and the background landmarks. The style should be reminiscent of classic children's book illustrations, aiming for an educational and engaging visual. The townhouses should be detailed enough to be interesting, but not so detailed that they become distracting. The entire scene should be contained within a 16:9 aspect ratio. The whole image should be hand-drawn, without any computer-generated effects.
