A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style depicting a flourishing English garden scene, rendered in a pastel color palette with subtle hints of red, white, and blue. In the center of the image, a meticulously crafted sundial stands prominently on a weathered stone pedestal. The sundial's gnomon casts a shadow pointing to the Roman numeral "V," symbolizing the number five. Around the sundial, five distinct clusters of blooming flowers are arranged, each cluster representing a year. These clusters transition in color and type, starting with vibrant red poppies, then white daisies, followed by bluebells, then lavender, and finally yellow daffodils, illustrating the passage of five years through the changing seasons. A winding stone path leads the viewer's eye toward the sundial, bordered by neatly trimmed hedges. In the background, a classic British countryside landscape unfolds, featuring rolling green hills dotted with sheep, all under a gentle, cloud-strewn sky. The overall composition should evoke a sense of timelessness and cyclical renewal, subtly reinforcing the concept of elections occurring every five years. The painting should avoid any text or numbers, relying solely on visual symbolism to convey the message.
