A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic watercolor illustrations. The scene is set against a soft, pastel blue background, evoking the tranquility of a pre-election atmosphere. The central focus is a vintage television set, its screen displaying a split image: on one side, a dignified leader of one political party delivers a speech; on the other, a similarly composed leader of a rival party addresses the audience. The television is subtly adorned with a small, stylized Union Jack flag sticker on its side, symbolizing British media. To the right of the television, positioned slightly behind it, is a classic radio broadcasting microphone stand, complete with a round, mesh-covered microphone. Emanating from the microphone are sound waves, visualized as delicate, swirling lines in pastel red and white, equally distributed to both sides, further emphasizing balance. The microphone is placed on a simple wooden desk. The overall composition is symmetrical and balanced, with soft lighting that creates a sense of impartiality and fairness. The entire image should avoid any text or numbers.
