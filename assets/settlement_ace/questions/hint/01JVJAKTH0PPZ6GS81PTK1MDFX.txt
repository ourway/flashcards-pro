A hand-drawn, realistic, watercolor-style image with a 16:9 landscape ratio depicting the Prime Minister standing at the center, slightly off-center. The Prime Minister, rendered in a classic, respectable style, is depicted holding a folder. Radiating outwards from the Prime Minister are approximately twenty senior Members of Parliament (MPs). Each MP is distinctively dressed in formal attire, subtly reflecting various cultural backgrounds within the UK. These MPs are positioned closer to the Prime Minister, signifying their direct appointment. Beyond this inner circle, the image fades into a soft, pastel blue wash, representing the broader group of MPs *not* directly appointed as ministers. The composition is designed to emphasize the smaller, more focused group of appointed ministers. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the Union Jack, but muted and gentle. The style is reminiscent of a classic political illustration, with an emphasis on clarity and realistic detail. The overall tone is calm and informative, designed to subtly reinforce the concept of a limited number of ministerial appointments, helping the user remember that the PM doesn't appoint as many as 80 senior MPs.
