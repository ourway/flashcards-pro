A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9, depicting a vintage television set from the 1920s, rendered in pastel blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag. The television is the central focus, positioned directly in the middle of the frame. The screen of the television displays a simple, yet iconic image: a stylized rendition of the Scottish Highlands, complete with rolling green hills, a serene loch reflecting the sky, and a scattering of delicate purple heather. On the top of the television, a small, stylized Scottish thistle is subtly placed. The background is a soft, blurred suggestion of a cozy, old-fashioned British living room, with hints of a fireplace and traditional wallpaper, all rendered in muted, warm tones. The overall impression is one of nostalgia and innovation, highlighting the Scottish origins of the invention. The light should be soft and diffused, creating a gentle, inviting atmosphere. The image avoids any text or numbers, relying solely on visual cues to evoke the concept of television and its connection to Scotland.
