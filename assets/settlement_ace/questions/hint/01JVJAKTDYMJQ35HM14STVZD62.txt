A vibrant, hand-drawn illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic British storybook art. The scene is set in a quaint English village square, bathed in the soft, pastel hues of a late spring afternoon. Dominating the center of the frame is a large, ancient oak tree, its branches stretching wide and laden with exactly five birdhouses. Each birdhouse is uniquely designed, one resembling a miniature Tudor house, another a classic red telephone box, a third a tiny stone castle, the fourth a thatched-roof cottage, and the fifth a miniature version of the Houses of Parliament. A small, colourful bird, possibly a robin or a blue tit, is perched on the entrance of each birdhouse. Below the oak tree, children are playing a game of hopscotch, with the hopscotch grid clearly marked with five squares. In the background, rolling green hills stretch towards the horizon, dotted with grazing sheep. The overall colour palette should be predominantly pastel blues, greens, and yellows, evoking a sense of peace and stability. The sun is setting, casting long, soft shadows that emphasize the passage of time. The composition should be balanced and harmonious, with the oak tree serving as a central anchor, visually representing the cyclical nature of elections every five years.
