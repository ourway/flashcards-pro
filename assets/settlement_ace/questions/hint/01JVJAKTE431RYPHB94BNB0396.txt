A meticulously detailed, realistic watercolor painting depicting a serene Scottish landscape under a gentle, persistent rain. The scene is dominated by rolling green hills in the Scottish Highlands, dotted with traditional stone crofts with slate roofs. In the foreground, a quaint village church stands prominently, its architecture distinctly Scottish Presbyterian, featuring a simple, unadorned design with a tall, slender spire. The church is surrounded by a well-maintained graveyard with weathered headstones. The rain is depicted as delicate, shimmering droplets, subtly emphasizing the idea of preservation. The color palette should be dominated by muted greens, blues, and grays, reminiscent of the Scottish climate, with the occasional splash of vibrant purple heather on the hillsides. The overall composition should evoke a sense of tranquility and enduring tradition. The lighting is soft and diffused, reflecting the overcast sky typical of Scotland. A subtle rainbow arches faintly in the background, symbolizing hope and the enduring spirit of the Scottish people and their Presbyterian faith. The art style should resemble the works of classic landscape painters, with a focus on detail and atmospheric perspective. The intention is to create a visual mnemonic linking the rain-soaked Scottish landscape with the preservation of the Presbyterian Church.
