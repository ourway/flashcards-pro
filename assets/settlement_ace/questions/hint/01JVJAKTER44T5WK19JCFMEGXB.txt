A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style depicting Dame Ellen MacArthur sailing solo in her boat around the world. The composition is centered, with the yacht taking up a significant portion of the frame, cutting through a vast, deep blue ocean. The yacht's sails are a crisp white, and the hull is painted in shades of pastel blue and white, reminiscent of the UK flag. The sky above is a gradient of light pastel blue to soft white, suggesting a clear day with fluffy clouds scattered across the horizon. The globe is subtly represented in the background as a watercolor wash, with continents faintly visible in shades of green and brown. MacArthur is depicted at the helm, her figure small but determined, clad in a bright yellow waterproof jacket. The overall feeling should be one of solitude, bravery, and the immensity of the ocean and the world. The artwork should evoke a sense of adventure and determination, capturing the essence of a record-breaking solo journey. The water should have subtle details to show the boat is moving, such as small waves and splashes.
