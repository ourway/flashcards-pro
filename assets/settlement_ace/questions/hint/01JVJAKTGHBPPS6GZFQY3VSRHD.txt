A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting Maiden Castle in Dorset, England. The art style should be realistic, evocative of classic British landscape paintings, and in a pastel color palette. The composition centers on the sprawling earthworks of Maiden Castle, showcasing its multiple concentric rings and defensive ditches. The castle sits atop a gently undulating hill, commanding a panoramic view of the surrounding Dorset countryside. The landscape is dotted with grazing sheep and wildflowers in bloom (primarily pastel pinks, yellows, and blues). In the distance, rolling green hills fade into a soft, hazy horizon. The sky is light blue with scattered, fluffy white clouds. A winding, narrow path leads up to the castle entrance, hinting at the ancient history and strategic importance of the site. The overall impression should be one of tranquility and timelessness, emphasizing the natural beauty of Dorset and the historical significance of Maiden Castle. The image should be devoid of any text, focusing solely on visual elements to create a memorable association between Maiden Castle and the Dorset landscape.
