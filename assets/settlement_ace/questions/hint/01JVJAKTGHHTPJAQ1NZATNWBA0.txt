A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a tranquil Irish countryside scene disrupted by the stark imagery of World War I. In the foreground, a traditional Irish cottage with a thatched roof sits peacefully amidst rolling green hills, sheep grazing contentedly nearby. A partially completed signpost stands beside the cottage, bearing the Gaelic inscription "Rialtas Baile" (Home Rule), its paint still wet, symbolizing the aspiration for self-governance. Emerging from the horizon line, encroaching upon the idyllic scene, are silhouettes of soldiers in World War I-era uniforms advancing across a smoky battlefield. The soldiers are depicted in muted, desaturated tones of grey and brown, contrasting sharply with the vibrant greens and blues of the Irish landscape. Wisps of smoke curl upwards, partially obscuring the sun, casting a somber shadow over the cottage and the unfinished signpost. The color palette leans heavily on pastel shades, with the greens and blues of the Irish landscape subtly mirroring the hues of the Union Jack flag. The overall composition conveys a sense of interrupted progress and the overshadowing effect of the First World War on the Irish Home Rule movement. The ratio is 16:9 and landscape orientation.
