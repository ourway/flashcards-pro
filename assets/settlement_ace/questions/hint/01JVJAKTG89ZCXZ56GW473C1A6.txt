A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting the iconic Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) in London, bathed in the soft, pastel hues of dawn. The tower is the central focus, dominating the 16:9 landscape composition. Around the tower, a celebratory scene unfolds: stylized bunting in pastel shades of red, white, and blue drapes subtly across the foreground, suggesting a festive atmosphere. Above the tower, seven stylized, shimmering diamonds are arranged in a gentle arc, each catching the light in a way that suggests radiant joy and celebration. These diamonds are not overly large or distracting but serve as a symbolic representation of the Diamond Jubilee. Below the tower, the River Thames reflects the pastel sky, with a few stylised boats sailing on it, adorned with small, pastel-coloured flags. The overall mood is one of gentle celebration, dignified elegance, and historical significance, designed to evoke a sense of pride and remembrance. The colour palette leans heavily on pastel blues, pinks, and creams, with subtle touches of red and deeper blue to echo the colours of the Union Jack. The sky is a soft gradient of these colours, creating a peaceful and memorable backdrop. The illustration should feel timeless and classic, reminiscent of vintage travel posters, while remaining distinctly British in its subject matter and style.
