A heartwarming, realistic watercolor illustration in a pastel color palette (primarily light blues, pinks, and creams) depicting two central figures against a soft, blurred background suggesting a welcoming community. On the left, a person in a wheelchair is laughing joyfully while playing a game of catch with a golden retriever. The wheelchair is modern and sleek but not overly emphasized, focusing instead on the person's expression of happiness and inclusion. The dog is well-trained and attentive, symbolizing companionship and capability. On the right, a newly married couple is holding hands. The bride is in a simple, elegant white dress, and the groom in a smart suit. They are looking at each other with affection, both radiating contentment. The background subtly features elements that represent community â€“ gentle rolling hills, stylized houses with warm light emanating from windows, and pastel-colored trees with heart-shaped leaves. The overall composition should convey a sense of belonging, acceptance, and the celebration of diverse human experiences. The style should be reminiscent of classic children's book illustrations, with soft lines, gentle shading, and a focus on positive emotions. The image should evoke a feeling of warmth and inclusivity, highlighting the protected characteristics of disability and marital status without being overtly literal.
