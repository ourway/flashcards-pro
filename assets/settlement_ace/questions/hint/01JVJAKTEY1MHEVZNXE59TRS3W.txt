A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting the double helix structure of a DNA molecule. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag. The DNA strand appears to be gently twisting upwards in the center of the 16:9 landscape format. The background is a soft, blurred wash of complementary pastel colors, suggesting a laboratory setting without explicitly showing equipment. The DNA molecule itself should be rendered with scientific accuracy, showing the base pairs (Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, Cytosine) subtly differentiated by color. Around the central DNA structure, small, stylized, almost ethereal, atoms float, hinting at the molecular level of the discovery. The artwork should not include any text or labels. The overall feeling should be one of scientific wonder and discovery, highlighting the beauty and complexity of the structure of DNA as a notable British invention.
