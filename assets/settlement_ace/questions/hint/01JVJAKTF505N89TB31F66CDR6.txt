A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style, ratio 16:9. The focal point is a close-up of a well-behaved, medium-sized Labrador Retriever dog sitting patiently in a park setting with green grass and a few scattered autumn leaves. The dog is primarily light golden in colour. Around the dog's neck is a clearly visible, traditionally styled brown leather collar. Attached to the collar is a small, shiny, silver-coloured dog tag shaped like a bone. The background is softly blurred to keep the focus on the dog and collar, but includes hints of classic British park elements like a wrought-iron park bench and a distant, stylised red telephone box. The overall colour palette should be warm and inviting, using pastel shades of green, brown, and gold, with subtle hints of red in the telephone box. The lighting should simulate a soft, overcast day, typical of the UK, casting gentle shadows. The style should evoke a sense of classic British charm and responsible pet ownership. The image should emphasize the collar as a standard and necessary accessory for dogs in public, much like a badge of responsibility. The scene should not depict any people or other distracting elements, ensuring the collar is the secondary focus after the dog itself.
