A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a pastel color palette (primarily blues, reds, and whites). The scene depicts a set of scales of justice, subtly off-balance. On one side of the scale, resting slightly lower, is a stack of five neatly bound, antique-looking books, each representing £1,000. The books are titled simply "£1000". The overall stack is labelled with a tiny, almost imperceptible "England & Wales" banner. On the other side of the scale, much higher up, are only three books, also labelled in the same way. The background is a soft, blurred depiction of the Houses of Parliament, rendered in muted blues and greys, to subtly indicate the legal context. The scales are made of polished brass and rest on a dark wooden table. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a gentle, educational atmosphere. The composition is centered, with the scales as the primary focus, emphasizing the visual comparison between the two amounts. The style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and legal gravitas but with a light and approachable feel, avoiding any harsh lines or overly dramatic shading. The goal is to visually represent the amount of £5,000 being greater than £3,000 in the context of the England and Wales legal system.
