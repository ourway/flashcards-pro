A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a majestic, vibrant red Welsh Dragon perched atop the rugged, mountainous landscape of Wales. The dragon, the undisputed focal point, should exude an air of regal authority and wisdom, its scales shimmering with intricate detail, reflecting the pastel hues of the sunrise. The dragonâ€™s posture should be noble, with its head held high, gazing towards the horizon. The Welsh landscape surrounding the dragon should include rolling green hills, interspersed with ancient stone castles and winding rivers, all rendered in soft, pastel shades of green, blue, and lavender. The sky above should be a gradient of pastel pink and orange, suggesting the dawn of a new day. The composition should be centered, ensuring the dragon and the Welsh landscape are the primary focus, with the outer edges of the 16:9 ratio subtly fading into a soft, diffused light. The overall atmosphere should evoke a sense of history, tradition, and the unique cultural identity of Wales, associating the dragon, a symbol of Wales, with a figure of princely stature. The artistic style should be reminiscent of classic landscape paintings, emphasizing realism and fine detail, while maintaining a gentle, educational tone. The colour palette should subtly incorporate the red, white, and green of the Welsh flag, ensuring visual harmony and cultural relevance.
