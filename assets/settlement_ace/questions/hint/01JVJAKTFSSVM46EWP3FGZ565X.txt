A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Winston Churchill standing resolutely against the backdrop of a stylized yet recognizable Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. The color palette leans heavily on blues, reds, and whites reminiscent of the Union Jack, subtly integrated without explicitly mimicking the flag. Churchill, rendered with historical accuracy in his iconic pinstripe suit, bow tie, and holding a cigar, is positioned centrally within the 16:9 frame. His expression is determined yet thoughtful. He is giving his famous "V for Victory" sign. Behind him, the sky is a swirling mix of pastel blues and grays, hinting at the tumultuous times of World War II, but with beams of sunlight breaking through, symbolizing hope and resilience. Below him, the River Thames flows gently, reflecting the colors of the sky, and tiny boats (civilian and military) travel down the river, adding depth and movement. The overall composition should evoke a sense of strength, leadership, and the unwavering spirit of the British people during wartime. The style should be reminiscent of classic war posters, but softer and more painterly. The image must be educational and avoid any elements that could be construed as glorifying war.
