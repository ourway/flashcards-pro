A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a dramatic yet symbolic scene representing the start of the War of the Roses. The focal point is a stylized rose bush, centrally positioned within the 16:9 frame. One side of the bush is laden with vibrant, crimson roses (representing the House of Lancaster), while the other side displays elegant, pure white roses (representing the House of York). The roses are in full bloom, signifying the peak of their power and the beginning of the conflict. The date is not explicitly shown, but is symbolically represented through the number of roses: approximately 14 crimson roses and 55 white roses are blooming. Beneath the rose bush, the ground is cracked and uneven, hinting at the division and strife within the country. Scattered fallen petals, some crimson and some white, lie on the ground, suggesting the casualties and the fragility of peace. The background features a soft, blurred landscape reminiscent of the English countryside, with rolling hills and a faint suggestion of medieval castles in the distance. The overall colour palette leans towards the colours of the UK flag: red, white, and blue, with soft pastel hues dominating the sky and the distant landscape. The sky is a pale blue with hints of grey clouds, adding a touch of solemnity. The composition aims for a balance between beauty and historical significance, creating a memorable visual representation of the War of the Roses and its approximate starting time.
