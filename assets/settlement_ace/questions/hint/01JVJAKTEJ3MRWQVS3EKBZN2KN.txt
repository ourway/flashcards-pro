A serene, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, capturing a meeting within a traditional Scottish Kirk (church). The scene is bathed in soft, pastel colors, primarily blues, grays, and muted reds, evoking a sense of calm and reverence. Dominating the center of the 16:9 composition is a large, round wooden table where a group of ministers and elders are gathered. The ministers are depicted in classic black clerical robes with white collars, their faces showing thoughtful expressions. Interspersed among them are the elders, distinguishable by their more casual, yet still formal, attire - tweed jackets and ties, reflecting their roles as respected community members. Sunlight streams through a stained-glass window depicting a thistle (the national flower of Scotland), casting colorful patterns on the table and faces. The table is adorned with a simple, open Bible, emphasizing the spiritual guidance at the heart of their discussions. The background features the architectural details of the Kirk â€“ stone walls, arched windows, and subtle Celtic patterns carved into the woodwork. The overall atmosphere is one of collaborative governance, with the subtle suggestion of shared responsibility and wisdom. The image should evoke a sense of Scottish heritage and the democratic nature of the Church of Scotland's governance.
