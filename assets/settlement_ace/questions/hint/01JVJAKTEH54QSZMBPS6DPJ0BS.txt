A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of medieval illuminated manuscripts. The scene depicts a somber, rolling English countryside under a perpetually overcast sky. In the foreground, a deserted village square is rendered in muted pastel tones. Houses with thatched roofs lean slightly, their windows dark and empty. In the very center of the image, a single, gnarled oak tree stands starkly silhouetted against the grey sky. Its branches, bare and twisted, reach upwards like skeletal fingers. At the base of the tree, a scattering of fallen leaves, tinged with black spots, represents the plague. In the background, a winding road leads towards a distant, abandoned castle, its towers shrouded in mist. The color palette primarily consists of greys, muted greens, browns, and blacks, with subtle hints of pastel blue in the sky, evoking a sense of desolation and historical weight. The overall composition emphasizes the emptiness and stillness, symbolizing the widespread devastation caused by the Black Death. Small details, such as overgrown weeds in the village square and broken fences, further enhance the feeling of abandonment and decay. The artwork should be emotive and accurately depict the tragedy of the Black Death.
