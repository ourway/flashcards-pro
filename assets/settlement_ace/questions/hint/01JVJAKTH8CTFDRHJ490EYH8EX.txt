A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a symbolic representation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The composition centers on a majestic oak tree, its roots intertwining and spreading across a landscape subtly divided into four distinct regions. The English portion of the landscape features rolling green hills dotted with quintessential cottages. To the north, the Scottish Highlands rise dramatically, complete with a loch reflecting a clear, crisp sky. Westward, the Welsh terrain showcases rugged mountains and a coastline with sandy beaches. To the northwest, a field of Irish linen flowers, symbolizing Northern Ireland, gently sways in the breeze. Overarching the oak tree is a single, unified royal crown, rendered in exquisite detail with shimmering jewels of ruby, sapphire, and emerald. The colour palette should be pastel, with soft blues, greens, and creams dominating the landscape, while the crown utilizes richer, deeper hues to draw the eye. The sky should be rendered with layers of translucent watercolour, creating a sense of depth and atmosphere. The overall feeling should be one of unity, strength, and historical significance, evoking the complete official name of the nation. The image should be 16:9.
