A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style reminiscent of historical illustrations from illuminated manuscripts, set against a 16:9 landscape. The central focus is a young King Edward VI, depicted as a youthful but determined figure, seated at a large, ornate wooden table. He's holding a quill pen poised above an open, leather-bound book â€“ the Book of Common Prayer. The book's pages are subtly illuminated, suggesting divine inspiration. Edward is dressed in regal attire, but his clothing incorporates soft, pastel blues and creams, subtly echoing the colours of the UK flag without being overtly patriotic. The table is adorned with objects symbolic of the Church of England: a simple silver chalice, a single white lily in a clear glass vase, and a partially unrolled scroll bearing faint, elegant calligraphy. Behind Edward, a stained-glass window filters soft light, depicting scenes of English countryside and religious iconography, but avoiding specific figures that might be misconstrued. The overall composition should convey a sense of solemnity, scholarly pursuit, and the dawn of a new era. The background includes subtle architectural details of a grand hall, rendered in muted greys and whites to avoid distraction from the central figure and the book. The colour palette should lean towards pastel shades, creating a gentle, educational, and memorable image.
