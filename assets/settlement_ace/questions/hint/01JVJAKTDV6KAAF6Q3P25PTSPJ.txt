A hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a vibrant, bustling British high street scene. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, reminiscent of the UK flag but softened for a gentle, educational feel. In the center of the image, a clearly visible, circular sign with a thick red border and a diagonal red line crossing out a detailed illustration of a brown beer bottle. The sign is mounted on a traditional black lamppost. A well-dressed individual in a tweed jacket and flat cap stands directly beneath the sign, conspicuously taking a swig from a glass bottle that is clearly alcoholic. To the right of the sign, a British police officer in full uniform, complete with helmet and baton, is depicted approaching the individual with a stern expression. The background should feature quintessential British elements: red brick buildings, a classic red telephone box, neatly arranged shops with awnings, and pedestrians of diverse ages and backgrounds going about their daily lives. The composition should guide the viewer's eye towards the central interaction between the sign, the individual drinking, and the approaching police officer, emphasizing the consequence of ignoring the prohibition. The art style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, with careful attention to detail in clothing, architecture, and facial expressions to create a believable and memorable scene.
