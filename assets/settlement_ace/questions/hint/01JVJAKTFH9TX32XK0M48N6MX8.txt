A meticulously detailed watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical educational charts, depicting a vibrant and bustling global gathering beneath a stylized, oversized dove representing peace. The central focus is a wide, circular table, symbolizing unity and global cooperation. Around this table are numerous figures, each distinctly dressed in national attire representing a multitude of countries and cultures. The figures are engaged in discussion and collaboration, some holding symbolic items like olive branches and blueprints for sustainable development. The color palette leans heavily on pastel shades of blue, white, and hints of red, subtly referencing the UK flag while maintaining a soft, educational tone. The backdrop features a stylized globe rendered in muted blues and greens, emphasizing the worldwide scope of the gathering. Subtle, radiating lines emanate from the dove, spreading outward to encompass the diverse assembly, reinforcing the idea of global reach and inclusivity. The overall composition aims to convey the concept of a large, diverse membership working towards common goals, effectively illustrating that the UN is far from having only five members. The illustration should evoke a sense of optimism, international cooperation, and the UN's widespread influence.
