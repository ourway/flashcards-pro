A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a classic British desk calendar open to a weekly view. The calendar is rendered in a pastel color palette, dominated by light blues and reds reminiscent of the Union Jack. The open calendar displays a full week, with each day neatly marked. Dominating the central square, which represents a Wednesday, is a miniature yet detailed illustration of the Houses of Parliament, specifically the iconic clock tower, Elizabeth Tower, formerly called St. Stephen's Tower, which houses Big Ben. A stylized speech bubble emanates from the Parliament illustration, symbolizing questions being asked. The overall composition should be clean and uncluttered, with the calendar filling most of the frame in a 16:9 landscape ratio. The background is a soft, out-of-focus wash of pastel colors. The calendar itself appears slightly worn, suggesting tradition and history. The focus is sharp on the Wednesday Parliament illustration, drawing the viewer's eye to the weekly event. The shadows are soft and subtle, giving the image a warm and inviting feel.
