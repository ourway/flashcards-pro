A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour image in a pastel colour palette (mainly blues and reds) depicting a split scene. The scene is divided vertically down the middle, representing the divide between domestic and international affairs. On the left side, the "Home" side, a detailed depiction of the interior of a classic British home. Inside, the Home Secretary, represented by a generic but distinguished-looking figure in a suit, is shown reviewing documents at a desk. The details include a Union Jack flag subtly placed in the background, perhaps as a small desk flag, and paperwork related to policing and immigration. The overall atmosphere is one of focused domestic policy. On the right side, representing "Foreign Countries," the British Prime Minister (identifiable by a subtle resemblance to a famous PM, but not overly caricatured) stands on a world map, shaking hands with a foreign leader. Symbolic elements include miniature landmarks representing different countries (Eiffel Tower, Taj Mahal) scattered across the map. The colour palette leans towards blues and reds, subtly reminiscent of the Union Jack. The background of the "Home" side is a soft, muted blue, while the "Foreign Countries" side has a warmer, slightly reddish hue. The composition is balanced, with equal weight given to both sides of the scene, emphasizing the distinct roles of the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister. The art style is realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, creating a clear and easily understandable visual representation of the concept.
