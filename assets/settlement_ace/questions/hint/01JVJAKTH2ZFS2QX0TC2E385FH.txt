A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the iconic Edinburgh skyline at twilight. The central focus is Edinburgh Castle, perched majestically atop Castle Rock, rendered with meticulous detail showcasing its historic stonework and battlements. Soft, warm light emanates from the castle windows, suggesting activity within. Below the castle, the winding streets of the Old Town are subtly suggested, with glimpses of traditional Scottish architecture. To the right of the castle, depict the modern Scottish Parliament building, its design blending seamlessly with the historic cityscape while representing contemporary governance. The sky is painted in pastel hues of blue, pink, and lavender, mirroring the colors of the Scottish flag, and reflecting in the calm waters of the Firth of Forth in the distance. Subtle hints of rolling green hills surround the city, emphasizing Scotland's natural beauty. The overall composition evokes a sense of history, culture, and the harmonious blend of old and new. A delicate mist hangs in the air, typical of the Scottish climate, adding an ethereal quality to the scene. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades, creating a calming and memorable visual representation of Edinburgh.
