A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a classic Formula 1 racing car speeding along a track under a bright, slightly overcast sky reminiscent of the British weather. The car is painted in a striking tartan pattern, subtly alluding to Sir Jackie Stewartâ€™s Scottish heritage. The background features rolling green hills, invoking the landscapes of the UK. The focus is on the gear stick inside the cockpit of the car. The driver's hand is visibly and clearly changing gears, illustrated in a sequence of three distinct positions: first gear, second gear, and third gear. Each gear change is emphasized with a soft, glowing aura in pastel shades of red, white, and blue, echoing the colours of the Union Jack. The racing track is lined with spectators waving small Scottish flags. The composition should be balanced, with the car centrally positioned and the three gear changes forming a visual narrative. The overall mood should be one of speed, skill, and a celebration of British sporting achievement. The absence of any text is crucial, relying solely on the visual elements to convey the correct answer of "3."
