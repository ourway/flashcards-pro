A watercolour-style 2D illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a British cityscape under a slightly overcast sky, rendered in pastel blues, greys, and creams. In the centre, a determined but slightly anxious-looking individual with a backpack stands on a cobblestone street. They are holding a crumpled stack of CVs in one hand and a map of the UK in the other. The cityscape behind them features iconic landmarks like Big Ben and the London Eye, subtly blurred to indicate they are in the background. Leading away from the character in multiple directions are pathways paved with job-seeking tasks, each path symbolized by different icons: one path has a magnifying glass representing research, another has a networking event silhouette, and a third has a closed door with a question mark hanging above it. A gentle breeze rustles the papers in their hand, subtly suggesting the uncertainty of the job market. The overall mood is hopeful yet realistic, conveying the effort required to find employment, despite having residency. The style should be reminiscent of classic travel posters, emphasizing detailed linework and soft, muted colours. The image should communicate the idea that residency does not guarantee employment, highlighting the separate and challenging process of job hunting. The scene should be devoid of any text.
