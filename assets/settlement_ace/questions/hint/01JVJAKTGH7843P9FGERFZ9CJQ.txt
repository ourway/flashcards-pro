A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a grand, ornate clock tower reminiscent of Big Ben, but distinctly Welsh in architectural style, incorporating elements like slate roofing and subtle Celtic knotwork detailing. The clock face displays no numbers; instead, around the perimeter are 60 individually depicted, diverse figures of people dressed in contemporary clothing, each representing an Assembly Member. They are arranged in a circle, symbolizing unity and collective responsibility. The color palette leans heavily on the Welsh flag: deep reds and greens dominate the landscape surrounding the tower, with the tower itself rendered in shades of white and grey, subtly hinting at the flag's dragon. The sky is a soft, pastel blue, providing a calming backdrop. The clock hands point to positions that subtly suggest progress and forward movement. The overall composition suggests the steady, measured passage of time and the vital roles of each individual within the assembly, working in unison. The artistic style is realistic but with a touch of whimsical charm.
