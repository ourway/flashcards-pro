A meticulously detailed, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the exterior of a classic British building, instantly recognizable as a Citizens Advice Bureau. The building should have a solid, respectable appearance, perhaps constructed from red brick or light stone, with large windows allowing light to spill onto the street. The building's entrance is framed by meticulously detailed architectural elements, such as columns or a decorative archway. Standing just outside the entrance is a friendly, approachable person, dressed in smart-casual attire, looking directly at the viewer with a warm smile. This individual is holding an open book or pamphlet, suggesting information and guidance. The backdrop features a subtly bustling British street scene, with classic red phone boxes and black cabs. Use a pastel color palette throughout the image, with accents of red, white, and blue subtly integrated to evoke the colors of the UK flag. The overall composition is balanced and inviting, with the focus firmly on the Bureau and the helpful citizen, creating a memorable visual mnemonic for the Citizens Advice Bureau. The image should be carefully hand-drawn with delicate brushstrokes and rich layering of color, giving it a timeless and trustworthy feel. The sky is slightly overcast, typical of British weather, but the colors are still vibrant and welcoming.
