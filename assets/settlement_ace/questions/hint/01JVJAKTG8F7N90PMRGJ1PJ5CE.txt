A watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London, bathed in the soft, diffused light of a late autumn morning. The Cenotaph itself, rendered in shades of Portland stone white, stands centrally within the 16:9 frame. Poppies, painted in vibrant reds and deep blacks, form a dense carpet at the base of the memorial, extending outwards towards the viewer. The surrounding architecture of Whitehall is subtly suggested with muted grey and beige tones, ensuring the Cenotaph remains the focal point. Above, a flock of doves, symbolizing peace, fly upwards in a V-formation, their white wings contrasting against a pale blue sky with soft pastel clouds. The overall composition should evoke a sense of solemnity and remembrance, with the poppies and doves acting as symbolic reminders of sacrifice and peace. The colour palette should be primarily pastel shades, with the exception of the vibrant red poppies, creating a poignant and memorable image. The illustration should have a hand-drawn feel, with visible brushstrokes and subtle variations in colour to enhance the artistic quality.
