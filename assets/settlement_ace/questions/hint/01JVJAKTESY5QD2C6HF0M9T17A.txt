A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, resembling a fashion runway scene, rendered in pastel colors with subtle hints of red, white, and blue to evoke the UK flag. The focal point is a split composition: on the left, a stylized interpretation of Alexander McQueen's dramatic fashion aesthetic is displayed, featuring an avant-garde gown with exaggerated silhouettes, perhaps incorporating feather or butterfly motifs, subtly referencing his iconic designs. On the right, a representation of Mary Quant's influence is showcased, featuring a model wearing a vibrant, geometric-patterned mini-skirt, complemented by knee-high white boots and a mod hairstyle. Behind both figures, faint, almost ethereal images of London landmarks like the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben are visible, creating a subtle backdrop that connects the designers to British culture. The runway itself should have a slightly textured appearance, like brushed cotton paper, to give it a handmade feel. The lighting should be soft and diffused, casting delicate shadows that emphasize the textures and details of the clothing. The overall composition should evoke a sense of sophistication and innovation, capturing the essence of both designers' contributions to the fashion world, while maintaining an educational and visually appealing aesthetic.
