A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a stylized, symmetrical battlefield scene. The artwork focuses on two opposing formations, each composed of figures artfully arranged to resemble the numeral "4." The left formation, representing Parliament, is adorned in muted shades of blue and grey, their attire reminiscent of 17th-century parliamentary soldiers, complete with simple, functional armor and determined expressions. Their banners bear the faint impression of intertwined laurel wreaths, symbolizing civic duty.

The right formation, symbolizing the Royalists, is depicted in richer, warmer tones of red and gold. Their attire reflects the opulence of the royal court, with feathered hats and elaborate, decorative armor. Their banners display a stylized crown interwoven with roses, emblematic of the monarchy.

Between the two formations, a chasm opens in the earth, subtly shaped like the number "1" and "6", dividing the battlefield. The sky above is a turbulent mix of grey and blue, hinting at the conflict. The overall composition is balanced and symmetrical, drawing the eye to the central conflict. The color palette leans towards pastel shades with strategic accents of red and blue to evoke the UK flag's colours and enhance visual memorability. The style should resemble historical illustrations found in textbooks, aiming for clarity and educational impact.
