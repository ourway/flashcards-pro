A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Sir Chris Hoy, the celebrated Scottish cyclist, powerfully riding a bicycle on a velodrome track. The color palette should be pastel and resemble the UK flag colours (blue, red and white). Hoy is positioned in the center of the 16:9 landscape image, wearing a Team GB cycling kit with subtle Scottish thistle emblems incorporated into the design. Six radiant, golden Olympic medals are visually orbiting around him, arranged in a semi-circle. Each medal is depicted with intricate detail, showcasing the Olympic rings and a sense of substantial weight and value. The velodrome track behind Hoy is slightly blurred to convey motion and speed, but also to keep the focus on Hoy and the medals. The background features a stylized representation of the Scottish Highlands in a muted blue tone, subtly suggesting his heritage. The overall composition is designed to evoke a sense of triumph, national pride, and the significant number "6" represented by the medals. The lighting should be soft and diffused, highlighting the golden sheen of the medals and the determined expression on Sir Chris Hoy's face.
