A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image in a realistic style, depicting a serene Scottish landscape under a pastel sky. The focal point is a quaint, stone-built Scottish courthouse, reminiscent of traditional Sheriff Courts. Soft pastel blues, whites, and reds subtly evoke the colors of the Union Jack, integrated gently into the architectural details and surrounding flora. In the foreground, a stylized but realistic depiction of a family—a mother, a father, and a child—stand with a visible, though muted, separation between the parents. The child is positioned slightly closer to the mother, symbolizing the family matters often handled in these courts. The overall mood should be calm and reflective, avoiding any sense of harshness or conflict. The courthouse is adorned with subtle Scottish thistle carvings, and the surrounding landscape includes rolling green hills dotted with heather. The scene is framed by mature trees with leaves in autumnal hues, giving a sense of time passing and the cyclical nature of life events. The composition should emphasize the centrality of the courthouse within the community, suggesting its role as a local institution. The artwork should be detailed enough to capture the nuances of Scottish architecture and natural beauty, but gentle and approachable to avoid any negative associations.
