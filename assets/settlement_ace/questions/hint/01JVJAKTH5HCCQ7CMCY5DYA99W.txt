A hand-drawn, realistic 2D illustration in watercolor style, depicting two distinct culinary scenes side-by-side, divided by a simple, elegant border. On the left, a picturesque Welsh tea party setting: a round wooden table draped with a delicate white lace tablecloth. Several golden-brown Welsh cakes are arranged artfully on a tiered cake stand, dusted lightly with powdered sugar. Around the table, three antique teacups filled with steaming tea, and a teapot with a knitted tea cozy in pastel colours. In the background, a sun-drenched window looks out onto the rolling green hills of Wales. On the right side of the image, a hearty Scottish feast: a rustic wooden platter holds a haggis, steaming gently. Around the haggis, arrange traditional accompaniments â€“ neeps and tatties (mashed turnips and potatoes) served in earthenware bowls. In the background, a stone fireplace with a crackling fire, evoking a sense of warmth and tradition. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel hues, with hints of red, white, and blue subtly incorporated to reflect the UK flag. The Welsh scene should have a lighter, airier feel, while the Scottish scene should be warmer and more robust. The division between the two scenes should be clear but not jarring, emphasizing that both dishes are part of British culinary heritage.
