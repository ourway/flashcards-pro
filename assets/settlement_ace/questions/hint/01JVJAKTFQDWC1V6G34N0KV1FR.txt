A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a stylized cricket match scene under a clear, pastel blue sky. The cricket pitch is centrally located within the 16:9 frame. Four figures, representing Bangladesh, India, South Africa, and the UK, are actively playing cricket. The figure representing Bangladesh is batting, wearing a green and red jersey. The Indian figure is bowling, dressed in a blue jersey. The South African figure is fielding, sporting a green and gold jersey. The UK figure is the umpire, dressed in a light grey blazer with a Union Jack pin. Each figure should have distinct features related to the area they represent. The background features subtle hints of each country's landscape: the Ganges river flowing gently behind the Indian bowler, lush green fields reminiscent of the English countryside behind the UK umpire, the Bengal Delta subtly suggested near the Bangladeshi batsman, and the Table Mountain faintly visible in the backdrop of the South African fielder. The colors should be primarily pastel, with the jerseys having a brighter hue. The overall composition is bright and cheerful, emphasizing teamwork and friendly competition under the Commonwealth banner. The style should be reminiscent of classic travel posters, with clean lines and a focus on clear representation.
