A serene, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a lone, weathered wooden cross silhouetted against a pastel-colored sky at twilight. The sky transitions from a soft lavender at the horizon to a pale rose and then a muted blue, reminiscent of the colors of the UK flag but in a pastel palette. The cross stands on a small, grassy knoll dotted with blooming white lilies, symbolizing purity and resurrection. At the base of the cross, a single, fallen white rose lies on the grass. The overall mood is somber but hopeful, with a gentle light emanating from behind the cross, suggesting spiritual significance. The art style should be realistic, capturing the textures of the wood and the delicate details of the flowers. The composition should be centered, drawing the viewer's eye to the cross as the focal point. Use soft, blended brushstrokes to create a peaceful and contemplative atmosphere. The background should be slightly blurred to keep the focus on the cross and the immediate foreground. The scene should evoke a sense of solemn remembrance and reverence, reflecting the significance of Good Friday.
