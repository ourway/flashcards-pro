A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a scene from the Stone Age. The image, in a 16:9 landscape ratio, centers on a wide, grassy land bridge connecting the white cliffs of Dover (stylized but recognizable) on the left to the coast of France on the right. The sea on either side is a muted, pastel blue, reflecting a soft, overcast sky. On the land bridge, a small group of Stone Age people are depicted walking eastward towards the continent. They are dressed in simple animal skins, carrying rudimentary tools and weapons. A few mammoths graze peacefully on the grassy plains of the bridge. The vegetation on the land bridge transitions subtly from lush green near the British side to a drier, more continental flora as it approaches France. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, greens, and browns, evoking a sense of ancient history and natural serenity. The sun is faintly visible through the clouds, casting a soft, diffused light across the scene. The painting style aims for a realistic representation of the landscape and figures, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements, and resembling a page from a historical atlas. The overall impression should be one of peaceful migration and the geographical connection between Britain and mainland Europe during the Stone Age.
