A watercolor-style illustration depicting the interior of the House of Commons, focusing on the Speaker's chair. The color palette leans heavily on muted blues, reds, and creams, reminiscent of the UK flag but in pastel shades. The Speaker's chair is prominently displayed, crafted from dark wood and adorned with subtle carvings of British flora (roses, thistles, shamrocks). In front of the chair, a single, unassuming figure stands â€“ an "ordinary" Member of Parliament (MP). The MP is dressed in typical business attire: a dark suit with a muted tie. The background shows other MPs, blurred and less defined, symbolizing the collective from which the Speaker is chosen. Soft, diffused light streams in from arched windows, illuminating the central figure and the chair. The overall composition emphasizes the Speaker's position as originating from the common ranks of Parliament. The artistic style should evoke a sense of tradition, respect, and the democratic process, with the focus being on the "ordinary" status of the person before becoming the Speaker. This will help the user visualize the correct answer and memorize it. The entire image is 16:9 ratio, with the main focus kept in the center of the drawing.
