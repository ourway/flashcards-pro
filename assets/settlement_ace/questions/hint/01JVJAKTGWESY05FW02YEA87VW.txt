A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic natural history illustrations. The scene depicts a majestic humpback whale breaching the surface of a calm, cerulean blue sea. The whale is predominantly grey with lighter mottled patterns, its massive form arcing gracefully against a backdrop of rolling green hills that subtly evoke the Welsh countryside. Above the whale, a stylized, almost ethereal map of the United Kingdom is suspended, rendered in soft pastel shades of blue and red, mirroring the colours of the Union Jack. The map is slightly translucent, allowing the sky to peek through, symbolizing the integral connection between Wales and the UK. The whale's tail, as it dips back into the water, creates ripples that subtly morph into the shape of a Welsh dragon, further reinforcing the association with Wales. The sky is a gentle gradient of pastel blues and pinks, providing a soft, dreamlike quality to the scene. The overall composition should be balanced, with the whale as the central focal point, surrounded by elements that subtly hint at the correct answer without being overly literal. The art style should evoke a sense of wonder and curiosity, encouraging the viewer to linger and explore the details. The illustration should have a warm, inviting tone, making it memorable and easy to recall.
