A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical paintings. The scene depicts a serene, sunlit clearing in a quintessential English countryside setting. In the center, a group of figures dressed in simple, dark clothing representative of 17th-century Puritan attire are gathered. One figure, standing slightly apart, holds an open book, presumably a Bible. Emanating from the book is a soft, golden light that illuminates the faces of the surrounding figures. This light symbolizes enlightenment and faith. Around the clearing, ancient oak trees stand tall, their branches reaching towards the sky, creating a sense of history and resilience. At the base of one of the trees, a small, symbolic hammer gently resting on a chisel is placed. The hammer and chisel are tools that represent the act of protest and reform. The color palette should be a blend of muted pastel shades, with hints of blue and red subtly incorporated to reflect the colors of the UK flag. The sky is a soft, pale blue with gentle, white clouds. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peace, reflection, and the quiet determination of the Puritans to reform their religious practices.
