A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic watercolor illustrations found in historical textbooks. The composition is centered on a majestic crown, the Crown of St. Edward, rendered with exceptional detail. The crown's gold is subtly shaded to convey depth and texture, and each precious stone – rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and pearls – is individually depicted with its unique color and facets, reflecting light realistically. The velvet cap beneath the crown is a deep crimson, rendered in soft watercolor washes to give it a plush appearance. The ermine trim is fluffy and white, with individual hairs suggested by delicate brushstrokes. The background is a soft, diffused pastel blue, subtly hinting at the royal robes and the history surrounding the monarchy. The light source appears to originate from the upper left, casting subtle shadows that further enhance the three-dimensionality of the crown. The overall color palette leans towards the red, white, and blue of the UK flag, yet softened into pastel tones to create a serene and dignified atmosphere. The entire image should evoke a sense of history, tradition, and regal authority, serving as a visual reminder of the Queen's role as head of state. The image is designed to be educational and memorable, emphasizing the iconic symbol of the British monarchy.
