A hand-drawn, realistic, 2D image in a pastel color palette, depicting a serene British countryside scene under a clear sky. In the center of the frame, nestled within a gently rolling green hill, is a quaint village church. Its stone architecture is classic British, with a tall, slender spire reaching towards the sky. To the left of the church, an Easter-themed vignette unfolds. A woven willow basket, overflowing with pastel-colored Easter eggs, sits partially hidden amongst blooming daffodils and tulips. Some eggs are playfully rolling down the gentle slope. To the right of the church, a Christmas scene is taking place. Carolers, dressed in Victorian attire with red and green accents, gather around a warmly lit Christmas tree placed just outside the church's entrance. The tree is adorned with traditional ornaments and a bright star on top. Snow gently falls, blanketing the ground in a soft layer. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peace, tradition, and the joyous spirit of these two Christian festivals within a quintessential British setting. The light should be soft and diffused, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The scene is framed in 16:9 format, centering the church and the two festival vignettes, with the rolling hills extending to the edges of the image.
