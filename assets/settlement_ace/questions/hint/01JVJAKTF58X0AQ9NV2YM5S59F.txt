A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the Houses of Parliament, focusing on the House of Lords chamber. The colour palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly echoing the colours of the UK flag. The composition centres on a long, ornate wooden table, around which peers in formal attire are seated. Light streams in through tall, arched windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air, creating a sense of history and importance. On the table, several rolls of parchment are scattered, each bearing a delicate red seal. A quill pen rests beside a partially unrolled scroll, as if in the middle of drafting. One peer, distinguished by their ermine-trimmed robes, is subtly gesturing with a hand towards the scroll, suggesting the act of proposing an amendment. The overall atmosphere is one of thoughtful deliberation and constructive contribution. The image should evoke a sense of the House of Lords' function as a body that suggests amendments and proposes new laws, rather than simply enacting them. Focus on the details of the robes, the table, and the scrolls to convey the historical weight and the role of the Lords in shaping legislation. The style should be reminiscent of classical British illustrations, emphasizing precision and realism.
