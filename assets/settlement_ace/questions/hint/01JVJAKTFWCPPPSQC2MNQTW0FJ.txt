A meticulously detailed watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic storybook art. The scene unfolds on a gently rolling, verdant Scottish hillside under a soft, pastel-blue sky. In the center of the frame, three Highland cows, rendered in shades of light brown and cream, graze peacefully. Each cow wears a small, intricately designed satchel around its neck. The satchels are overflowing, not with coins, but with stylized, swirling clouds of mist, subtly suggesting value. The first cow’s satchel has one cloud, the second has two, and the third has three. The clouds are a very light pastel blue, almost white. Beneath the cows, partially obscured by the tall grass, are three stone cairns, each marked with a simple, Celtic knot design. In the distant background, a misty loch reflects the pastel sky, and a silhouette of a Northern Irish castle sits atop a small hill. The overall color palette leans heavily on soft blues, greens, and browns, evoking the natural beauty of Scotland and Northern Ireland. The composition emphasizes depth and tranquility, with the three cows serving as the central focal point, subtly reinforcing the 'three' in £3,000, while the environment hints at the regions where this claim limit applies. The cows should be drawn in a realistic style, not cartoonish or abstract.
