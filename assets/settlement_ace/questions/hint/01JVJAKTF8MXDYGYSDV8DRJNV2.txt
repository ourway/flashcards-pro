A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical painting, depicting the return of Charles II to England in 1660. The composition should center on a grand ship, adorned with the royal standard of England, sailing towards the white cliffs of Dover. Charles II, dressed in regal attire with a dark wig and a blue velvet coat, stands prominently on the deck, his hand outstretched towards the shore. The ship is surrounded by smaller vessels, filled with cheering crowds waving flags of England. The sky above is partly cloudy, with rays of sunlight breaking through to illuminate the ship and the coastline. The English coastline features rolling green hills and the iconic white cliffs, symbolizing England. In the foreground, a small group of formally dressed people kneels in welcome on the shore. Pastel colours should dominate the image, with shades of blue, green, and gold. The overall tone should evoke a sense of restoration, hope, and national unity. The style should be similar to classic oil paintings but executed in a hand-drawn manner.
