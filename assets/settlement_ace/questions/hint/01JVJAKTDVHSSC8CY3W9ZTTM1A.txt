A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a cross-section of British society being chosen for jury duty. The scene centers around a large, transparent glass box, resembling a lottery machine, filled with countless small, rolled-up scrolls, each representing an individual from the electoral register. Gentle, pastel-colored light illuminates the box, highlighting the diversity within. Emerging from the box are twelve distinct scrolls, each unfurling to reveal a symbolic representation of a person: a miniature doctor's bag, a tiny builder's helmet, a miniature chef's hat, a small book, a musical note, a paintbrush, a computer keyboard, a spanner, a cog, a shopping basket, a stethoscope, and a house. These symbols represent the diverse occupations and backgrounds of individuals on the electoral register. The background subtly incorporates elements of the UK flag â€“ a hint of blue sky, a wisp of white cloud, and a touch of red brick in a distant building. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, with a focus on the central lottery machine to emphasize the concept of random selection. The watercolour style lends a sense of transparency and openness, reinforcing the impartiality of the jury selection process. The colours should be mainly in pastel shades of blue, red and white to resemble the UK flag.
