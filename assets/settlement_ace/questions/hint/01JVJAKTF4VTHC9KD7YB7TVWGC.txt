A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style (16:9 landscape) depicting a serene yet somber scene reminiscent of Good Friday. The central focus is a weathered wooden cross, silhouetted against a pastel dawn sky. The sky transitions from deep blues and purples at the horizon to soft pinks and oranges higher up, mirroring the solemnity and hope associated with the day. At the base of the cross, a single, blooming white lily is depicted, symbolizing purity, resurrection, and hope. The ground around the cross is barren and rocky, painted in muted browns and grays. A gentle breeze is suggested by the slight curve of the lily's stem. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with subtle hints of the UK flag's colors â€“ a faint red tinge in the dawn sky, blue undertones in the shadows, and the white lily. The art style should evoke a sense of reverence and reflection. The composition should be balanced, with the cross centrally positioned but not dominating the frame, allowing the sky and lily to contribute to the overall atmosphere. The lighting should be soft and diffused, emphasizing the somber yet hopeful nature of Good Friday. The image should avoid any graphic or violent imagery, instead focusing on symbolic elements that convey the day's significance.
