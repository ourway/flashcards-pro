A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, rendered in a pastel color palette with subtle hints of red, white, and blue. The scene depicts a split composition. On the left side, a quill pen rests elegantly on a stack of aged parchment, partially unrolled to reveal faint, handwritten script reminiscent of Jane Austen's era. Delicate floral motifs, inspired by Regency-era wallpaper, subtly frame this side. On the right side, a similar quill pen is positioned near a stack of manuscripts bound in a darker, more industrial-looking leather, symbolic of Charles Dickens' time. A faint, smoky cityscape backdrop, alluding to Victorian London, is visible behind the manuscripts. The pens are angled toward each other, almost touching at their tips in the center of the frame, symbolizing the shared profession. A single, shared inkwell, crafted from delicate porcelain and filled with a vibrant blue ink, sits precisely at the intersection of the two scenes, highlighting the single common element: their craft. The overall composition should evoke a sense of literary history and the timeless art of storytelling through novels, with the pens being the focal point. The background elements should be soft and slightly blurred to keep the viewer's attention on the pens and the manuscripts.
