A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour illustration depicting a symbolic representation of the United Kingdom's voting registration systems, set against a pastel blue sky. At the center, a large, ornate fountain, crafted from light grey stone, represents the unified voting system of Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales). Water flows smoothly and continuously from the fountain's tiers into a shared basin. To the right of the fountain, subtly separated by a winding path of cobblestones, stands a small, quaint cottage, colored in pastel green, representing Northern Ireland. In front of the cottage, a single, determined figure is meticulously filling out a form at a small wooden table. The figure is dressed in neutral colors. The cobblestone path leading to the cottage is slightly overgrown with clovers, symbolizing Northern Ireland's distinct identity. The overall composition should evoke a sense of unity and shared governance, while also highlighting the unique, individualistic approach to voter registration in Northern Ireland. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel blues, greens, and greys, with subtle hints of red and white in the fountain's design to subtly echo the UK flag, ensuring a visually appealing and memorable image.
