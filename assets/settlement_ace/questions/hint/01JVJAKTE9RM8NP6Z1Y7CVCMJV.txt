A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a pastel color palette, depicting two central figures against subtly symbolic backdrops, fitting a 16:9 aspect ratio. On the left, Tim Berners-Lee is portrayed with a thoughtful expression, his hands gently gesturing towards a vast, intricate spiderweb that radiates outwards from him. The web, rendered in delicate pastel blues and whites, encompasses stylized representations of global landmarks – the Eiffel Tower, the pyramids, the Great Wall of China – subtly interconnected, representing the World Wide Web. On the right, Alan Turing is shown beside a complex, brass-and-copper mechanical device, Turing Machine, with gears and levers meticulously rendered. Turing is depicted in a pose of concentrated thought, almost as if he's mid-calculation. The background behind Turing is a faint, blueprint-style grid, suggesting the mathematical foundations of computing. A soft, diffused light source illuminates both figures, highlighting the intricate details of their inventions. The composition should balance the two figures, emphasizing their equal contributions, with the spiderweb and the mechanical device visually linked by the subtle pastel color scheme. The overall impression should be one of quiet innovation and intellectual brilliance, celebrating these two pivotal inventors of the 20th century.
