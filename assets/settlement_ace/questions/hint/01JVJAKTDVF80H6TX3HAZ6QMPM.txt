A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a scene outside a classic British police station, constructed of red brick and featuring traditional arched windows. The colour palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly reminiscent of the UK flag without explicitly replicating it. In the centre of the frame, a uniformed police officer with a kind but firm expression stands beside a slightly bewildered-looking individual. The officer's hand is gently gesturing towards the individual, as if explaining something. Emanating from the officer's mouth is a visually symbolic representation of a magnifying glass, focusing on a puzzle piece. The puzzle piece itself is brightly coloured and clearly distinct, suggesting the concept of a 'reason' becoming clear. The background shows other officers going about their duties, but the central focus remains on the interaction between the officer and the individual. The overall atmosphere is calm and informative, emphasizing the importance of understanding the reason for an arrest. The sky is a soft, watercolour blue, suggesting a bright, clear day. Subtle details like the officer's polished shoes and the individual's slightly rumpled clothing add to the realism and narrative of the scene.
