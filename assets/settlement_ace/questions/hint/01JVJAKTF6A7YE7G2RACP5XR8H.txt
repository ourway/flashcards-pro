A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a pastel color palette (mainly blues, pinks and whites). The image depicts a split scene, divided vertically down the center. On the left side, a woman resembling Anne of Cleves, dressed in elaborate 16th-century German attire with a distinctive headdress, stands in front of a stylized, pastel-colored German landscape. The landscape includes rolling green hills, a quaint village with half-timbered houses, and a distant, fairytale-like castle on a hill. The sky is a pale blue with soft, fluffy white clouds. In her hand, she delicately holds a small, pastel-colored German flag. On the right side, a sharply contrasting Spanish scene unfolds. A flamenco dancer in a vibrant red and black dress strikes a pose in front of a stylized Spanish landscape. This landscape includes a sun-drenched plaza, a Moorish-style building with intricate details, and a distant mountain range. The sky is a deep blue, almost indigo, with a blazing sun. The dancer holds a red rose in her hand. A clear, visual separation exists between the two scenes, emphasized by a thin, white line down the middle. The composition highlights the distinct cultural and geographical differences between Germany and Spain, subtly reminding the viewer that Anne of Cleves was not Spanish. The overall style should feel like a page from an elegant historical atlas, emphasizing accuracy and detail while maintaining a gentle, educational aesthetic.
