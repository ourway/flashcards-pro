A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D illustration in a watercolour style, ratio 16:9 and landscape orientation. The central focus is a grand, ornate oil lamp radiating a warm, golden light. The lamp is intricately designed, with subtle British motifs etched into its base, such as small roses and thistles. The light emanating from the lamp illuminates three distinct scenes arranged around its glow. To the left, scholars in 18th-century attire are deeply engaged in political debate, gesturing emphatically and holding scrolls. To the right, a philosopher is seated at a writing desk, quill in hand, surrounded by stacks of books and scientific instruments like a telescope and a globe. Directly below the lamp, a scientist is conducting an experiment with glass beakers and bubbling liquids, carefully observing the results. The background is a soft, muted blue, reminiscent of a twilight sky, providing a calming contrast to the vibrant light. All colours should be pastel colours. The composition should convey a sense of intellectual curiosity and discovery, highlighting the emergence of new ideas in politics, philosophy, and science during the Enlightenment. The artwork style should be reminiscent of classical illustrations found in historical textbooks, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements.
