A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a vibrant, friendly-looking Welsh Dragon, its scales rendered in shades of red and green, reminiscent of the Welsh flag. The dragon is depicted with a slightly furrowed brow and a speech bubble (empty, of course, as there is no text) pointed away from its mouth towards a stylized, simplified thistle, the national flower of Scotland. The thistle is coloured in soft purple and green hues and appears slightly translucent, as if a distant concept. The background consists of rolling green hills, typical of the Welsh countryside, fading into a misty horizon. The sky is a pastel blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The dragon is positioned slightly to the left of the frame, emphasizing its importance, while the thistle is placed on the right, indicating a separation or difference. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, creating a gentle, educational atmosphere. The dragon should appear wise and knowledgeable, but also slightly dismissive of the Scottish thistle, conveying the idea that the Children's Hearings System is not a Welsh matter. The artwork should be detailed and realistic, avoiding any cartoonish or overly simplified elements. The aim is to create a memorable visual mnemonic, associating the Welsh dragon with the rejection of a Scottish symbol (the thistle) to reinforce the correct answer: False.
