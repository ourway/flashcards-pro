A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, 16:9 ratio, depicting a serene, sunlit Scottish pasture. In the center stands a fluffy, white sheep, "Dolly", with a gentle, intelligent expression. Behind Dolly, slightly blurred to indicate their supportive roles, are two figures: Sir Ian Wilmut on the left and Keith Campbell on the right. Sir Ian is depicted in his mid-50s, wearing a tweed jacket, gazing at Dolly with a look of pride and accomplishment. Keith Campbell is portrayed similarly, with a lab coat subtly visible beneath his jacket, holding a barely visible petri dish containing cells, also looking towards Dolly. The background features rolling green hills dotted with heather and distant stone fences, characteristic of the Scottish Highlands. The sky is a pastel blue with soft, white clouds. The color palette leans towards soft blues, greens, and whites, with touches of heather purple. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, emphasizing the scientific breakthrough within a natural, pastoral setting. The style should evoke a sense of scientific accuracy combined with the beauty of the Scottish landscape, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements.
