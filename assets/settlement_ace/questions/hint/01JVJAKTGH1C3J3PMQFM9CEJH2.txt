A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Queen Elizabeth I, centered within a 16:9 landscape format. She is not seated on a throne, but standing confidently on a slightly raised platform, designed to resemble a Tudor rose made of stone. Her iconic red hair is elaborately styled, adorned with pearls. She wears a magnificent, but not overly embellished, golden gown embroidered with Tudor roses. Her expression is intelligent, serene, and subtly powerful. A soft, warm light illuminates her face. Behind her, rendered in a muted pastel blue, is a suggestion of the English countryside, with rolling hills and a glimpse of a distant castle, representing England in the 16th century. In the foreground, scattered gently around the base of the Tudor rose platform, are individual white roses, symbolizing purity and admiration. The color palette should lean towards the pastel tones of the UK flag: soft reds, blues, and whites. The overall composition should evoke a sense of respect, historical significance, and the enduring image of a beloved monarch.
