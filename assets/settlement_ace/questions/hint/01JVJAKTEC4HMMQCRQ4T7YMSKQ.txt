A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, depicting a serene yet poignant scene commemorating Remembrance Day. The artwork should have a 16:9 aspect ratio and utilize a pastel color palette with subtle reds, whites, and blues reminiscent of the UK flag. The central focus is a field of vibrant red poppies, meticulously detailed to showcase their delicate petals and dark centers. The poppies are depicted in full bloom, bathed in the soft, warm light of a late autumn sun. In the background, a gently rolling landscape of the British countryside is visible, with faint outlines of hills and trees in muted greens and browns. The sky is a pale blue, almost white, with soft, watercolor clouds drifting lazily. Subtly embedded within the poppy field, almost hidden, are silhouettes of soldiers standing at attention, their forms slightly transparent and ethereal, symbolizing the fallen. The overall composition aims for a sense of solemn beauty and quiet reflection, evoking the somber yet hopeful spirit of Remembrance Day. The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, to create a respectful and educational visual aid.
