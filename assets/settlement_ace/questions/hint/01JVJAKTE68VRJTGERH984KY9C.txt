A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the naval battle of 1588, but with a key alteration to represent the "False" answer. The central focus is a fleet of Spanish galleons, sails emblazoned with the Spanish flag, engaged in battle against smaller, but agile English ships flying the St. George's Cross. The color palette leans heavily on the red, white, and blue of the Union Jack, but with softer, pastel hues overall. Wisps of cannon smoke mingle with the sea mist, creating a dynamic yet slightly ethereal atmosphere. Instead of French ships, the opposing fleet is clearly Spanish. The composition should emphasize the size and might of the Spanish Armada, but also highlight the strategic positioning and maneuverability of the English fleet. The sea should be a tumultuous mix of blues and greens, reflecting the intensity of the battle. Above, storm clouds gather, adding to the dramatic tension. In the distance, the faint outline of the English coastline is visible. The overall scene should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and maritime power, while subtly reinforcing the idea that it was the Spanish, not the French, who attempted to invade England in 1588. The sky is a blend of light blues and whites, mimicking the British flag.
