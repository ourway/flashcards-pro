A 16:9 landscape, hand-drawn, realistic watercolour illustration depicting a clear distinction between the legal systems of Scotland and England. The scene is split vertically in the middle, with Scotland on the left and England on the right. The Scottish side features a majestic, ancient stone castle perched atop a misty, heather-covered hill, bathed in soft morning light. In front of the castle, a wise-looking judge in traditional Scottish robes meticulously writes in a large, bound book with a quill pen. The book represents the codified laws of Scotland. The colours are predominantly blues, purples, and greens, mirroring the Scottish landscape and flag. The English side depicts a sprawling, green English countryside with rolling hills and sheep grazing peacefully. In the foreground, a judge in an English wig and gown listens intently to a group of people presenting arguments, with no book in sight. Sunlight streams through the scene. The colours are warmer, with greens and golds dominating. The overall composition emphasizes the contrast: Scotland's organized, written law versus England's tradition of unwritten, case-based common law. The absence of a written record on the English side, contrasted with the prominent book on the Scottish side, should be the central visual mnemonic. The colour palette should incorporate pastel shades and hints of red, white, and blue, subtly referencing the Union Jack.
