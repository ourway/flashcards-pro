A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a stylized Scottish thistle, rendered in shades of deep purple and vibrant green, its thorny leaves intricately detailed. Emerging from the base of the thistle, as if growing organically, is a stone archway reminiscent of traditional Scottish architecture. The archway is slightly weathered, giving it a sense of history and permanence, and is bathed in a soft, diffused light. Above the archway, a flock of exactly 99 stylized birds, each a tiny silhouette, soars into a sky that transitions from a pastel blue at the horizon to a slightly darker, almost lavender hue above. The birds are arranged in a way that their formation loosely suggests the shape of the numeral '1999.' The background features a rolling, heather-covered landscape in muted greens and purples, evoking the Scottish Highlands. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, purples, and greens, with subtle hints of red in the thistle's details, subtly referencing the colors of the Union Jack without explicitly depicting the flag. The art style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish elements, and focus on capturing the natural beauty of Scotland. The composition should aim for balance and harmony, creating a serene and memorable image that subtly hints at the year 1999 and the establishment of the Scottish Parliament.
