A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a triptych, representing the three times the UK has hosted the Olympic Games. Each panel depicts a distinct Olympic Games hosted in the UK. The first panel, on the left, showcases the 1908 London Olympics. A sepia-toned scene features athletes competing in classic events against the backdrop of Edwardian-era London architecture, with a subtle Union Jack flag waving in the background. The second, central panel, in vibrant blues and greens, illustrates the 1948 London Olympics. Post-war austerity is hinted at through a simple, functional stadium design, yet the spirit of athleticism shines through, represented by runners in motion and doves being released. The third panel, on the right, bursts with modern energy, depicting the 2012 London Olympics. Vivid colors highlight iconic London landmarks like the London Eye and the Shard, with stylized representations of diverse athletes participating in various sports. Subtle pastel hues reminiscent of the Olympic rings (blue, yellow, black, green, and red) are interwoven throughout the composition. The overall style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and exuding a sense of historical significance and national pride. The background should transition subtly from a vintage parchment texture on the left to a smooth, contemporary finish on the right, mirroring the progression of time.
