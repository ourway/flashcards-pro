A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a scene from the English Civil War era. The focal point is a large, ancient oak tree with gnarled branches and dense, vibrant green leaves, centrally framed within the 16:9 aspect ratio. Concealed within the upper branches of the oak, partially obscured by leaves, is a figure representing Charles II. He is depicted wearing period-appropriate clothing â€“ a dark doublet, breeches, and a slightly tarnished crown resting precariously on his head. His expression should be one of cautious observation, with his eyes peeking through the leaves. Below the tree, on a forest floor rendered with fallen leaves and dappled sunlight, a small group of Cromwell's soldiers are marching past. They are clad in the uniforms of the New Model Army, with stern faces and carrying pikes and muskets. They should appear unaware of the figure hidden above. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades, with muted greens, browns, and blues dominating the scene. The sunlight filtering through the leaves should create a sense of naturalism. The background should fade slightly to create depth, with other trees and foliage suggested but not sharply defined. The composition should emphasize the contrast between the vulnerability of Charles II and the unawareness of his pursuers, highlighting the significance of the oak tree as his refuge. The artwork should avoid any cartoonish or abstract elements, maintaining a realistic and historically accurate depiction.
