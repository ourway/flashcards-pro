A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a stylized, yet realistic, depiction of a classic British betting shop facade. The shop's exterior is painted in muted, pastel shades of blue and red, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The large windows are slightly steamed up, hinting at activity inside. Peeking out from behind a drawn curtain is a hand holding a betting slip. In the foreground, a cobblestone street is rendered with careful detail. Standing prominently in the center is a milestone marker, aged and weathered. Etched into the stone are Roman numerals "XVIII" in a classic serif font, representing the number 18. To the left of the milestone, a stylized ballot box is visible, decorated with a simple Union Jack. To the right, a bottle of ale is placed, with light refracting off its surface. The light should be soft and diffused, giving the scene a nostalgic, slightly dreamlike quality. The sky above is a pastel blue with soft, watercolor-style clouds, creating a sense of tranquility and order. The overall composition should feel balanced and informative, with each element carefully placed to reinforce the concept of "18" as a key age.
