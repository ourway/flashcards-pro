A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, rendered in a pastel color palette with hints of the UK flag's colors (red, white, and blue). The composition is a split scene, divided vertically down the center. On the left side, depict a lush, manicured garden representing York. Dominating this garden is a large, blossoming white rose bush, its petals detailed with delicate shading to show depth and texture. The white roses are vibrant and healthy, symbolizing the House of York. Intertwined within the white rose bush is a subtle, elegant sword, its hilt adorned with a small white rose emblem. On the right side, mirroring the York garden, showcase a similar, equally well-maintained garden representing Lancaster. Here, a prominent red rose bush thrives, its red roses depicted with the same level of detail as the white roses, signifying the House of Lancaster. A similar sword, mirroring the one in the York garden, is subtly placed within the red rose bush, its hilt bearing a small red rose emblem. The background on both sides should fade into a soft, neutral color, drawing attention to the roses and swords. The overall impression is one of balanced beauty and subtle conflict, with the roses and swords visually representing the two houses engaged in the War of the Roses. The scene should evoke a sense of historical elegance and rivalry. The image ratio should be 16:9.
