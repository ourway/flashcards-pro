A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a historical scene within the Scottish Parliament. The colour palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the colours of the UK flag. The composition centres on a grand hall, bathed in soft, natural light filtering through arched windows. Dominating the scene are three distinct groups of figures, representing the three Estates of the Scottish Parliament. On the left, a group of Lords is depicted, dressed in elaborate robes and fine attire, some holding ornate scrolls and documents. In the centre, the Commons are shown, a more diverse group of individuals representing various trades and professions, engaged in lively discussion. To the right, the Clergy is represented by figures in religious vestments, some holding Bibles or other religious texts. Each group is clearly delineated, yet positioned to suggest a unified assembly. Architectural details, such as stone columns, intricate carvings, and heraldic banners, enrich the background, giving a sense of historical authenticity. The overall impression is one of balanced representation and collective deliberation, visually reinforcing the idea of a three-part structure, not a two-part division, within the Scottish Parliament.
