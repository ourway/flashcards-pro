A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a serene English countryside scene bathed in soft, pastel hues. The central focus is a gnarled apple tree, its branches heavy with ripe, red apples. One apple is prominently featured mid-fall, suspended in the air just above the head of a seated Isaac Newton. Newton is portrayed as a middle-aged man with a thoughtful expression, dressed in simple, 17th-century attire, and holding a notebook and quill. Instead of musical notes or instruments, the notebook contains diagrams and equations related to physics and gravity. The background features rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep, a quaint stone cottage with a smoking chimney, and a clear blue sky with fluffy white clouds. A gentle breeze rustles the leaves of the apple tree, adding a sense of movement and life to the scene. The overall composition should evoke a sense of tranquility, intellectual curiosity, and the quintessential English countryside, emphasizing Newton's scientific pursuits rather than any musical association. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades of green, blue, red, and white.
