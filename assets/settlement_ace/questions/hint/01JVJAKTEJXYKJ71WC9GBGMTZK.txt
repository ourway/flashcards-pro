A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a split scene representing two key figures who fought against Napoleon. The left side of the image showcases a dynamic naval battle scene under a cloudy sky, with tall sailing ships firing cannons. The ship in the foreground bears a faint, stylized emblem reminiscent of the Royal Navy. Standing heroically on the deck is Horatio Nelson, depicted with an empty right sleeve, gazing determinedly towards the enemy ships. His figure is illuminated by a beam of light breaking through the clouds, highlighting his bravery. The right side of the image shows a land battle scene on a green field with soldiers charging amidst smoke and cannon fire. In the center stands the Duke of Wellington on horseback, calm and commanding, observing the battlefield. His bicorne hat is slightly tilted, and his gaze is focused. The background features rolling hills and a strategically placed British flag fluttering in the wind. The color palette should predominantly feature blues and grays for the naval battle, and greens and browns for the land battle, with subtle hints of red and white to subtly resemble the UK flag. The overall composition should emphasize the contrast between the sea and land battles, symbolizing the dual effort required to defeat Napoleon. The style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and patriotic pride, reminiscent of classical war paintings, with meticulous attention to detail in the uniforms, ships, and landscapes.
