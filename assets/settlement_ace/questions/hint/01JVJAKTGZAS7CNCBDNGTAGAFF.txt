A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style depicting the statue of Boudicca in London. The statue, a bronze sculpture of a woman standing in a chariot pulled by two horses, should be centrally positioned within the 16:9 frame. Boudicca is depicted with flowing red hair and dressed in Celtic attire, a determined expression on her face, and holding a spear. The horses are rearing up, conveying a sense of power and defiance. The statue is set against the backdrop of the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben, subtly blurred in the distance to maintain focus on the statue. The sky above should be overcast with shades of grey and blue, reflecting a typical London day. The color palette should include earthy tones for the statue and horses, with touches of red in Boudicca's hair and clothing. Pastel blues and greys should dominate the sky and background, creating a soft, historical atmosphere. The composition should emphasize the statue's grandeur and its place within the heart of London, ensuring that the image serves as a memorable visual cue connecting Boudicca to the capital city. The overall mood should be heroic and reflective, honoring Boudicca's legacy.
