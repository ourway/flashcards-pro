A watercolour-style 2D illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a Scottish landscape under a twilight sky. Dominating the center is a silhouette of St. Andrew holding a saltire (the Scottish flag, a white cross on a blue background). The saltire is subtly glowing, casting a soft, ethereal light. In the foreground, a calendar page is partially visible, with the number "30" prominently displayed in a deep, rich blue, almost black, to represent the late hour and the end of the month. Around the number "30", fallen autumn leaves are scattered, painted in warm hues of red, orange, and brown, signifying the month of November drawing to a close. In the background, rolling hills of the Scottish Highlands fade into the twilight, with a few strategically placed, softly lit cottages suggesting a sense of community and tradition. The overall colour palette should lean towards cool blues, purples, and greys for the sky and hills, contrasted with the warm colours of the leaves and the glowing saltire. The art style should be realistic but with a slightly painterly quality, giving it a timeless, classic feel, reminiscent of traditional Scottish landscape paintings. The composition should guide the viewer's eye towards the central elements: St. Andrew, the glowing saltire, and the number 30 amidst the autumn leaves.
