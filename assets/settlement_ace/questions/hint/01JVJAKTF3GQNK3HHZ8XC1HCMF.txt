A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style (16:9 ratio). The central focus is a stylized silhouette of James Bond, sharply dressed in a dark grey suit, standing confidently against a backdrop that seamlessly blends iconic British landmarks. The backdrop transitions from the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben on the left to the Scottish Highlands on the right, subtly merging to represent the UK. Bond holds a stylized, sleek silver pistol pointed slightly downwards. Around Bond, various gadgets and symbols associated with the franchise float gently: a miniaturized Aston Martin DB5, a golden gun, and a roulette wheel. The color palette predominantly uses pastel variations of blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the Union Jack. The overall composition aims for a sophisticated yet playful feel, avoiding harsh lines and embracing soft gradients to create depth. The image should evoke a sense of British elegance, adventure, and the timeless appeal of the James Bond franchise, subtly emphasizing its UK origins and global success. The rendering should be detailed, capturing the texture of the suit fabric and the sheen of the gadgets, while maintaining a focus on clarity and visual appeal.
