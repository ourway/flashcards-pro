A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The scene depicts the interior of a bright and airy polling station in the UK. Dominating the center is a long, polished wooden table with a crisp white tablecloth. Behind the table, two election officials, a woman with neatly styled grey hair and a man with a trimmed beard, both wearing subtle name tags, are seated. The woman is looking up with a warm, welcoming expression, and the man is looking down at a large, open register book. A voter, a young woman with a friendly face, stands before the table. She is holding a polling card in one hand and offering a polite smile. In the background, subtly out of focus, are other voters patiently waiting in a queue. The overall color palette utilizes pastel shades, dominated by blues, reds, and whites reminiscent of the UK flag but softened for a calming effect. Sunlight streams in through a large window, illuminating the scene and casting gentle shadows. A small, potted plant sits on the table, adding a touch of domesticity. The composition focuses on the interaction between the voter and the election officials, emphasizing the act of confirming identity. The artistic style should evoke a sense of civic duty, trust, and community. The image should convey the process of providing personal information at a polling station without explicitly depicting any text.
