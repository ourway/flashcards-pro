A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vast, rolling green field under a pastel blue sky. The field should be subtly divided into sections, symbolizing a survey pie chart. Dominating the center of the image is a field of vibrant green grass, representing the majority of the population. Tucked away in the lower-center of the field, nearly blending in with the green but subtly distinct, is a tiny patch of lavender flowers. These flowers represent the 0.5% of people who identified as Jewish. Above the lavender patch, a single, stylized Star of David is formed by the negative space between the pastel-colored clouds, barely noticeable but present. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades, interspersed with the green of the field, and hints of blue from the sky, creating a serene and harmonious composition. The style should evoke a sense of peaceful countryside, emphasizing the small but significant presence of the Jewish community within the broader UK population. The ratio is 16:9, with the main subject and idea being mainly in the center of the image.
