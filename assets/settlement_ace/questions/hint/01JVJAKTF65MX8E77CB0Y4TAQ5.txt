A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a serene countryside scene in the UK. The focal point is a quad bike (representing the 4%) parked gently on a lush, green field dotted with blooming wildflowers. The quad bike is coloured in pastel green and white, with subtle details showing wear and use, suggesting a vehicle used for practical, everyday tasks. In the background, rolling hills reminiscent of the Yorkshire Dales fade into a soft, pastel-blue sky. A small flock of sheep graze peacefully in the distance. A winding stone path leads from the quad bike towards a quaint, traditional stone cottage with a thatched roof, partially visible behind a cluster of trees. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of green, blue, and white, with touches of earthy browns in the cottage and path, creating a calming and idyllic scene that subtly evokes the British countryside. The composition is balanced, with the quad bike centrally positioned and the background elements providing context and depth. The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast day, enhancing the peaceful and contemplative mood. No text or numbers should be included.
