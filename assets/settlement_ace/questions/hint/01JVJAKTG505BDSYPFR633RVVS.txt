A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a detailed depiction of a medieval sailing ship, reminiscent of the Bayeux Tapestry style, cutting through a body of water. The ship's sails are predominantly white with a subtle fleur-de-lis pattern repeated across them, symbolizing French origins. The hull of the ship is painted in shades of blue and red, echoing the French flag. The water is depicted with gentle, pastel blue and white waves, indicating a manageable sea voyage. In the background, on the left side of the image, receding into the distance, is the coastline of France, marked by rolling green hills and a small, stylized depiction of a medieval French village with a church spire. On the right side of the image, also receding into the distance, is the coastline of England, featuring the white cliffs of Dover. Above the ship, a flock of seagulls flies in the direction of England, creating a sense of movement and direction. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with hints of red, white, and blue, evoking both the French and British flags in a subtle, harmonious way. The sky is a soft, gradient of light blue and white, giving a sense of calm and historical significance. The image should evoke a sense of historical journey and connection between France and England, emphasizing William the Conqueror's origin.
