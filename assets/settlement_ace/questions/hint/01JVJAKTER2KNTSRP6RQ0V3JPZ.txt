A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting an Iron Age scene in Britain. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades with subtle hints of red, white, and blue to evoke the UK flag. The central focus is a craftsman meticulously crafting a coin. He is rugged, wearing simple woven clothing, and working in a rudimentary forge. The forge is built from rough-hewn stones and clay, with a bellows pumping air into the fire. The fire glows with warm oranges, yellows, and reds, illuminating the craftsman's face and hands. On a nearby workbench, crafted from roughly cut wood, are several finished coins. These coins are not perfectly round but have a more organic, hand-shaped appearance. They bear simple, stamped designs â€“ perhaps representations of animals or primitive symbols. Scattered around the workbench are various tools: a hammer, tongs, and small chisels. The background should show a glimpse of the Iron Age settlement: roundhouses with thatched roofs, livestock grazing in a field, and people engaged in daily activities. The overall atmosphere should convey a sense of antiquity, craftsmanship, and the dawn of economic activity in Britain. The composition should draw the eye towards the coin being crafted, emphasizing its significance as one of the first forms of currency in the region. The image should evoke a sense of history and the ingenuity of the Iron Age people.
