A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a pastel color palette (primarily blues and whites), depicting a stylized, serene sky filled with doves carrying olive branches. The doves are arranged in a circular formation, resembling the shape of the Earth as viewed from above, with each dove representing a nation contributing to global peace. At the center of the dove circle, there is a single, larger dove, colored in a soft, muted gold, symbolizing the United Nations. Emanating from this central dove are gentle, radiating lines of light, signifying the organization's influence in promoting peace and security. The background sky transitions from a light blue at the top to a pale, almost white, horizon line. The overall composition should evoke a sense of hope, unity, and international cooperation. The art style should lean towards detailed realism, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, with each dove individually rendered with delicate feather details. The pastel color scheme and soft lighting should contribute to a calming and optimistic atmosphere, reinforcing the idea of peace and security, and the doves should be the main focus in the center of the 16:9 image ratio.
