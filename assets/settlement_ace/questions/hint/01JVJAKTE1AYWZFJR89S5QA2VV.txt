A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, showcasing a regal scene set against a backdrop reminiscent of the English countryside. The color palette leans towards pastel shades with subtle hints of red, white, and blue, echoing the UK flag. Dominating the center of the 16:9 landscape composition is a majestic, yet slightly disgruntled-looking king, adorned in traditional royal attire â€“ a velvet robe trimmed with ermine, a golden crown, and a jeweled scepter. He sits on an ornate throne. Hovering near the king is a large, antique scroll, representing the Magna Carta. Emanating from the scroll are subtle, glowing lines that gently encircle the king, visually symbolizing the document's influence and constraint. His facial expression is one of mild annoyance, not rage, suggesting a limitation rather than an outright stripping of power. His hand is slightly lowered, implying a yielding. The overall atmosphere should be one of historical significance and subtle power dynamics, alluding to the Magna Carta's role in curbing monarchical authority. The background features rolling green hills dotted with quintessential English cottages, rendered in soft, muted tones, grounding the scene in its historical and geographical context. The light source is soft and diffused, creating a gentle, non-threatening ambiance.
