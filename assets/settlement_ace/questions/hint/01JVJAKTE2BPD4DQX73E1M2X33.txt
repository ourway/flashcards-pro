A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a brand-new, shiny red British-style Mini Cooper parked in front of a quintessential English countryside scene. The Mini Cooper is the central focus, gleaming under a soft, diffused sunlight. Behind the car, rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep stretch towards the horizon. A weathered, but charming, stone cottage with a thatched roof nestles amidst the hills, adding to the idyllic scene. In the foreground, close to the Mini Cooper, three saplings are planted in a row, each marked with a small, elegant wooden tag. The first tree has a fresh, vibrant green color, the second a slightly darker hue, and the third has matured slightly, showing a stronger trunk and more developed leaves. These trees visually represent the passing of three years. A subtle, almost ethereal, golden glow emanates from the Mini Cooper, symbolizing its youthful vibrancy. A small, official-looking MOT certificate is subtly placed under the windshield wiper, almost hidden, yet present. The color palette should primarily feature pastel shades with touches of red, white, and blue, reflecting the UK flag in a muted and artistic way. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peace, progress, and the gentle passage of time, subtly reinforcing the "3 years" concept.
