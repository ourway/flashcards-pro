A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a single, exquisitely rendered Tudor rose, its petals exhibiting a striking contrast between deep crimson red and pristine white. The red and white are not blended but distinctly separated within the rose, perhaps with one half being predominantly red and the other white, or with alternating red and white petals that create a harmonious balance. The rose is set against a soft, blurred background of pastel blues and creams, reminiscent of a serene dawn sky. Subtle details such as delicate veins on the petals and tiny water droplets clinging to the edges add to the realism. Around the central rose, subtly incorporate symbolic elements: faint outlines of York's white rose and Lancaster's red rose are ghosted in the background, partially overlapped by the Tudor rose, symbolizing their unification. The overall composition should evoke a sense of historical significance and regal elegance, with the colors subtly echoing the UK flag while maintaining a gentle, educational tone. The artwork should emphasize clarity and beauty, making the red and white Tudor rose visually memorable.
