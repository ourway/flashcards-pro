A hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image in a realistic style, depicting a somber landscape under a cloudy, overcast sky. The scene focuses on a vast field of poppies, predominantly red with subtle shades of pink and crimson, gently swaying in the breeze. The poppies are densely packed, creating a sea of red that stretches towards the horizon. Interspersed among the poppies are subtle, almost translucent silhouettes of British soldiers in World War I uniforms, their heads bowed slightly in remembrance. The overall color palette leans towards muted, pastel tones, dominated by reds, grays, and blues, subtly reminiscent of the Union Jack. The composition emphasizes the sheer number of poppies to symbolize the immense loss of life. The sky is a blend of soft grays and blues, with a hint of diffused light breaking through the clouds, casting a gentle glow on the poppy field. The horizon line is blurred, giving a sense of endlessness and the vast scale of the tragedy. The art style should evoke a feeling of quiet reflection and remembrance, avoiding any harsh or jarring elements. The central focus is the poppy field with the soldier silhouettes, creating a powerful visual mnemonic for 'The Somme' and the immense casualties suffered. The image should capture the solemnity and scale of the event.
