A hand-drawn, realistic watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting two distinct scenes connected by a flowing river representing communication. On the left side, a detailed, but slightly blurred, depiction of the Houses of Parliament in London under a cloudy sky. A stylized figure representing a Member of Parliament (MP) stands near the building, with people walking past, suggesting a busy, formal environment. On the right side, a vibrant scene of a local community, perhaps a village green or a bustling high street. The same MP figure is depicted here, engaging directly with members of the public. The community scene includes diverse individuals, a local shop, and a community notice board. The connecting river is a light pastel blue, with small paper boats floating down, each boat carrying a letter. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, red, and white, subtly referencing the Union Jack. The composition should emphasize the equal importance of both scenes, visually illustrating that MPs are accessible both within the formal setting of Parliament and within their local constituencies. The watercolour style should give a soft, approachable feel, making the image feel informative and engaging.
