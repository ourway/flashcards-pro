A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a sun rising over a landscape reminiscent of the English countryside. The sun should be stylized, with rays of light extending outwards, each ray subtly illustrating an element of the Enlightenment. One ray shows a quill writing on parchment (philosophy), another a stylized atom model (science), and a third a balanced scale (politics/justice). The landscape below is green and rolling, dotted with subtle landmarks symbolic of the 18th century, such as a Georgian-style building in the distance and a winding cobblestone road. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, evoking the colors of the UK flag in a soft, muted tone. The composition should emphasize the central sun, making it the focal point, with the landscape providing a grounding and contextual element. The image should feel hopeful and illuminating, capturing the spirit of intellectual advancement and progress. The art style should avoid harsh lines, instead using soft gradients and washes of color to create a sense of depth and atmosphere. The entire image should have a classical, timeless feel, avoiding modern elements. The image ratio should be 16:9, with the sun positioned centrally.
