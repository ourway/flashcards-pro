A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic, watercolor style, depicting the interior of the House of Commons, focusing on the Speaker's Chair. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly echoing the UK flag. The Speaker's Chair is ornately carved from dark wood, with intricate details highlighted in gold leaf. A figure, representing the Speaker, is seated in the chair, dressed in traditional Speaker's robes, complete with a powdered wig. The Speaker is depicted with a calm, authoritative expression, holding a gavel in their right hand. The background shows rows of MPs seated on benches, some appearing to be engaged in lively debate, while others listen attentively. The overall scene is illuminated by soft, diffused light filtering through large arched windows, creating a sense of order and decorum. The composition is centered on the Speaker's Chair, emphasizing its importance in maintaining order. The image avoids any text and focuses solely on visual elements to represent the Speaker's role as the chair of debates in the House of Commons, contrasting with the Prime Minister, who sits among the other MPs. The art style should be reminiscent of historical illustrations, lending an air of gravitas and tradition to the scene.
