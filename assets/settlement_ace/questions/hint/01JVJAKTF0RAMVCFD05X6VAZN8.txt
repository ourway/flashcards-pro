A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour painting in a realistic style, depicting a historical scene representing the Scottish Parliament. The composition is centered, adhering to a 16:9 landscape ratio. The scene unfolds within a grand hall reminiscent of a Scottish castle, bathed in soft, pastel colours. Three distinct groups of people are visually separated but interconnected within the hall. On the left, a group representing the Lords, dressed in rich, deep blue robes, are depicted with thoughtful expressions. On the right, a group representing the Commons, clad in earthy, muted red tones, are engaged in animated discussion. In the centre, positioned slightly forward, is a group representing the Clergy, adorned in crisp, clean white and pale grey vestments, symbolizing their spiritual role. Subtle, symbolic details are woven throughout: a Scottish thistle emblem subtly integrated into the architectural details of the hall, and banners bearing the Saltire (Scottish flag) hanging discreetly in the background. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating an atmosphere of solemnity and historical significance. The overall artistic style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and educational clarity, emphasizing the three distinct estates of the Scottish Parliament, avoiding any text or numerals.
