A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour illustration depicting the Houses of Parliament, focusing on a symbolic representation of the relationship between the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The composition centers on the iconic Palace of Westminster, bisected vertically. On the left side, representing the House of Commons, a robust, grounded oak tree flourishes, its roots deeply embedded in the earth, symbolizing the Commons' connection to the people. The oak's leaves are a vibrant, healthy green. On the right side, representing the House of Lords, a more slender, stylized silver birch tree reaches towards the sky. The birch has fewer leaves, depicted in a muted silver-grey, and its roots are less pronounced, suggesting a less direct connection to the populace. Above both trees, a stylized, ornate scale hangs in perfect balance. A subtle but powerful beam of light shines more brightly on the oak tree side, signifying the Commons' ultimate authority. The background features a soft, pastel-coloured sky with hues of blue and a faint touch of red, echoing the colours of the Union Jack. The overall art style should evoke a sense of historical importance, balance and the weight of decision-making.
