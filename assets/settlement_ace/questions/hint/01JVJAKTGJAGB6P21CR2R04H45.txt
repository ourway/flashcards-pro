A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a stout, regal oak tree dominating the center of a lush, rolling green English countryside under a pastel blue sky. The oak's leaves are a mix of vibrant greens and autumnal browns, suggesting the passage of time. Partially obscured within the dense foliage of the oak, is a figure dressed in royal attire, but disheveled and slightly comical: King Charles II. His crown is askew, and his robes are muddy, subtly conveying his vulnerable and undignified situation. He peeks cautiously through the leaves, his expression a mix of fear and determination. At the base of the tree, scattered elements hint at the ongoing conflict: a discarded royal standard, a broken sword, and a helmet slightly buried in the earth. The colors should predominantly feature pastel shades of green, blue, and brown, with subtle hints of regal red and gold in the king's attire, creating a visually appealing and memorable image. The overall composition should be balanced and serene, contrasting the beauty of the English landscape with the turmoil of the historical event, solidifying the image as a visual mnemonic for the question and its answer. The image ratio should be 16:9.
