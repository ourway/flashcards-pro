A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, showcasing Skara Brae on Orkney. The scene should be set on a windswept, grassy coastline under a pastel blue and white sky reminiscent of the Scottish Highlands. The village itself, nestled low to the ground, should dominate the center of the 16:9 landscape. Illustrate the stone dwellings with their characteristic covered passageways and entrances, paying close attention to recreating the textures of the weathered stones. Inside one of the visible dwellings, subtly hint at Stone Age life with carefully placed depictions of stone tools, pottery shards, and perhaps a rudimentary stone bed. Around the village, suggest the surrounding environment with depictions of the sea, seabirds circling overhead, and the rugged Orkney landscape stretching into the distance. The colour palette should be dominated by pastel blues, greens, and browns, subtly referencing the UK flag through the blue sky and the earthy tones of the landscape. The overall composition should evoke a sense of history, resilience, and the intimate connection between the village and its natural surroundings. The image should capture the feeling of a place that has bravely withstood the test of time, offering a glimpse into a distant past.
