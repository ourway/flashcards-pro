A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the contrasting landscapes of Scotland and Northern Ireland. The image is divided vertically into two distinct scenes, each occupying roughly half of the 16:9 canvas. The Scottish side, bathed in soft, warm pastel yellows and oranges reminiscent of a sunrise, showcases a vibrant landscape featuring the iconic Scottish Highlands. Rolling green hills dotted with purple heather lead towards majestic, snow-capped mountains in the distance. A winding river, reflecting the warm sunlight, flows past a quaint village with stone houses, subtly suggesting the cities of Dundee and Aberdeen, represented by simplified architectural elements. A bagpiper in traditional Scottish attire stands prominently on a small hill, playing his instrument. A stylized Scottish thistle is placed near the center of the Scottish landscape. The Northern Ireland side is depicted in cooler pastel blues and greens, conveying a sense of serene beauty. The landscape features the Giant's Causeway, with its distinctive basalt columns, extending into a calm, turquoise sea. Lush green fields, separated by traditional stone walls, roll gently towards the coastline. A small flock of sheep grazes peacefully in a field. A subtle, stylized shamrock is placed near the center of the Northern Irish landscape. A faint, stylized dotted line visually separates the two halves, subtly emphasizing the geographical distinction. The overall composition emphasizes the distinct beauty and character of each region, ensuring the viewer instantly recognizes the difference between Scotland and Northern Ireland, and remembers that Dundee and Aberdeen are associated with Scotland, not Northern Ireland.
