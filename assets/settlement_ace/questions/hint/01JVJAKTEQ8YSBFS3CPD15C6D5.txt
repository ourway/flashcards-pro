A vibrant, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, resembling a watercolor painting, capturing the essence of Diwali celebrations by both Sikhs and Hindus. The scene is set in a shared courtyard, bathed in the warm, golden light of countless diyas (oil lamps). In the center, a group of people are joyfully lighting diyas and setting off fireworks. To the left, depict a Sikh family, the father wearing a turban, the mother in a traditional Punjabi suit, and their children, all with smiling faces. They are placing diyas around a small shrine adorned with a Nishan Sahib flag (Sikh religious flag). To the right, show a Hindu family, the mother in a sari, the father in traditional attire, and their children. They are arranging diyas around a small altar with statues of Hindu deities, such as Lakshmi and Ganesha. The background subtly blends elements of both Sikh and Hindu places of worship - a distant view of a Gurdwara (Sikh temple) on one side and a Hindu temple on the other. The colour palette should be dominated by warm, inviting tones like gold, saffron, and red, interspersed with the pastel colours of blue and pink. The composition should emphasize unity and shared celebration, with the light from the diyas serving as a central unifying element. The image should be rich in detail, capturing the textures of the traditional clothing, the intricate designs of the diyas, and the festive atmosphere of Diwali. The overall style should evoke a sense of joy, peace, and cultural harmony, visually representing the shared celebration of Diwali between Sikhs and Hindus.
