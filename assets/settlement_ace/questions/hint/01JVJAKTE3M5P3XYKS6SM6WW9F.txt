A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the grand facade of a stately English manor house, "Brideshead," under a slightly overcast sky. The architecture should be distinctly British, reminiscent of the interwar period, with prominent columns, arched windows, and manicured gardens stretching out in the foreground. The color palette should lean towards muted pastel shades, with hints of blues and grays evoking a sense of nostalgia and melancholy. In the garden, subtly place symbolic elements: a peacock strutting proudly (representing vanity and societal pretension), a half-finished chess game (representing the strategic and sometimes absurd nature of social maneuvering), and ivy slowly creeping up the walls of the manor (symbolizing the decaying grandeur and the passage of time). The overall composition should be balanced and symmetrical, drawing the viewer's eye towards the central image of Brideshead, emphasizing its imposing presence. The scene should evoke a sense of both beauty and underlying satire, hinting at the complex themes of Evelyn Waugh's novel without being overly explicit. The sky should be slightly dramatic, with soft clouds hinting at the emotional turmoil within the story. All elements should blend seamlessly to create a memorable and thought-provoking visual representation of "Brideshead Revisited."
