A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Battle of Hastings. The scene is set on a rolling green hill in the south of England, under a pale blue sky with wisps of white clouds. The focal point is a clash between Norman and Saxon soldiers. Norman knights, clad in chainmail and helmets, charge on horseback, their lances lowered, towards a shield wall of Saxon infantry. The Saxons, with their round shields and axes, stand firm, their faces determined. The colors are primarily muted blues, reds, and browns, resembling the color palette of the UK flag but in a softer, pastel tone. Scattered across the battlefield are fallen soldiers, broken weapons, and shields emblazoned with simple heraldic designs. In the foreground, a Norman knight is unhorsing a Saxon warrior, symbolizing the Norman victory. The overall composition should evoke a sense of movement, chaos, and historical significance. The edges of the image should fade slightly, as if the scene is part of an ancient tapestry, emphasizing the historical narrative. The image must not include any text or numbers. The image ratio is 16:9.
