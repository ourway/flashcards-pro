A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, depicting a serene yet poignant scene commemorating Remembrance Day. The image, in a 16:9 landscape format, centers around a stylized clock tower reminiscent of Big Ben, but with a distinctive, gentle design. The clock face displays the time at precisely 11:00 AM. Around the base of the clock tower, a field of vibrant red poppies stretches into the distance, their delicate petals rendered with careful detail. The poppies are densely clustered near the tower, gradually thinning out towards the horizon. Above the poppy field, eleven stylized doves, symbolizing peace, are ascending into a pastel blue sky. The doves are arranged in a loose flock, their wings outstretched in graceful flight. The overall color palette should evoke the UK flag, with dominant reds in the poppies, blues in the sky, and subtle whites in the doves' feathers. The light should be soft and diffused, creating a somber yet hopeful atmosphere. The composition should guide the viewer's eye from the clock face, down to the poppies, and up to the doves, subtly reinforcing the association with the 11th hour, 11th day, and the theme of remembrance and peace. The art style should be realistic but with a touch of painterly softness, avoiding harsh lines or overly saturated colors.
