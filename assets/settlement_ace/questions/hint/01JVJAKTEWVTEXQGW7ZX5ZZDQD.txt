A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a fantastical "Glass Isle." The island itself is rendered in shimmering, translucent glass, catching the sunlight and reflecting a pastel rainbow of colors. The island's shape vaguely resembles the outline of both the Isle of Wight and Glastonbury Tor merged together. On the higher ground of the "isle" (representing Glastonbury), a whimsical, oversized acoustic guitar rests, its body crafted from stained glass in shades of blue, red, and white, reminiscent of the Union Jack flag. Miniature figures, also rendered in watercolor, are dancing and playing musical instruments around the guitar. Gentle waves lap against the glass shoreline of the island. The sky above is a soft pastel blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The overall composition should evoke a sense of joy, music, and the unique atmosphere of a British summer music festival. The scene is bathed in warm, inviting light, emphasizing the transparent nature of the "Glass Isle" and its connection to music. Emphasis should be on the intricate details of the glass guitar and the lively figures, creating a memorable and engaging image.
