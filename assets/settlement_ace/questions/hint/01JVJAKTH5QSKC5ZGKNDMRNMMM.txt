A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Tower of London against a soft, pastel-coloured sky at dawn. The Tower should be the central focus, rendered with historical accuracy, showcasing its imposing stone structure, turrets, and battlements. Subtle pastel blues, greys, and creams should dominate the colour palette. Inside the Tower grounds, a faint, ethereal silhouette of Anne Boleyn is visible, her head slightly bowed, suggesting a sense of sorrow and impending doom. The overall composition should evoke a sense of solemn history and tragedy. The River Thames flows gently in the foreground, reflecting the Tower's image and the pastel sky. A single, white rose, representing innocence and remembrance, floats on the water near the Tower's edge. The image should be framed to emphasize the Tower's grandeur and its role as a silent witness to history, with a focus on the melancholic atmosphere surrounding Anne Boleyn's fate. The style of the drawing should resemble a historical illustration found in a detailed textbook, aiming for clarity and emotional depth without being overly dramatic. The entire scene should convey a sense of historical weight and the personal tragedy of Anne Boleyn within the imposing context of the Tower of London.
