A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting two distinct yet interconnected festival scenes. The left side of the 16:9 canvas showcases a sunny seaside vista, representing the Isle of Wight Festival. A lively crowd of diverse individuals, rendered in pastel clothing, are silhouetted against a backdrop of rolling green hills that meet a sparkling blue sea. Instruments like guitars, trumpets, and drums are subtly integrated into the landscape, appearing almost as natural formations within the hills. The sky above is a gradient of soft blues and pinks, with stylized seagulls soaring overhead.

The right side of the canvas transitions into a mystical Glastonbury-inspired scene. A stylized, emerald green valley unfolds, dotted with tipis and tents, suggesting a sprawling festival ground. In the far distance, a shimmering, ethereal city made of glass-like structures rises, hinting at the legendary nature of Glastonbury. The sky above Glastonbury is a twilight hue, blending deep blues and purples, with faint, stylized constellations visible. A winding path connects the Isle of Wight scene to the Glastonbury scene, symbolizing the collective experience of music festivals across the UK. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, interspersed with occasional vibrant pops of blues, reds, and greens reminiscent of the UK flag, creating a harmonious and visually appealing composition. The composition should have the Isle of Wight scene blending into the Glastonbury scene.
