A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, capturing a scene within the British Houses of Parliament, specifically the House of Commons. The color palette should predominantly feature pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the Union Jack. The composition centers on the Speaker's Chair, around which MPs are seated in tiered rows. The MPs are not individually distinct but are suggested through variations in clothing color and posture. A beam of soft, diffused light illuminates a group of MPs on one side of the chamber, subtly implying a larger number compared to the opposite side, visually representing the "majority." Symbolic elements are woven throughout: tiny, almost imperceptible scales of justice are subtly engraved on the Speaker's Chair, representing fairness, and miniature lions, symbols of England, are integrated into the architectural details of the room. The overall atmosphere should be one of dignified order, with a gentle focus on the group of MPs bathed in light, reinforcing the concept of the majority party tasked with forming the government. The scene should be detailed enough to be engaging but not overly crowded or distracting, maintaining a clear visual hierarchy that guides the viewer's eye to the core concept. The aspect ratio is 16:9.
