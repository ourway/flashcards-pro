A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a diverse group of people standing on a level, green field under a pastel blue sky. The group should be composed of individuals of varying ages, ethnicities, physical abilities (including one person using a wheelchair), and visible religious attire (such as a hijab, turban, or kippah). The colour palette should be pastel, with muted reds and blues incorporated to evoke the UK flag subtly. The central figures should be holding hands, forming a semi-circle. Each person is smiling gently, and their clothing, while diverse, should be clean and well-maintained, reflecting respect and dignity. Behind the group, a stylized, gently rolling landscape evokes the British countryside, with subtle hints of landmarks like a distant, misty tower. Sunlight gently illuminates the scene, casting soft shadows that do not obscure any individual. The composition emphasizes unity and equality, with each person equally visible and contributing to the overall sense of harmony. The hand-drawn style should give the image a warm, approachable feel, reinforcing the message of inclusivity and fairness.
