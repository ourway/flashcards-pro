A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Elizabeth Tower, commonly known as Big Ben, connected to the Houses of Parliament. The Houses of Parliament should be showcased with intricate architectural details, emphasizing its Gothic Revival style, including pointed arches, detailed windows, and ornate stonework. The colour palette should be dominated by pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the colours of the UK flag. The sky above should be a soft pastel blue, with gentle, watercolour-style clouds. The River Thames should be visible in the foreground, reflecting the building's image with subtle ripples. In the foreground, include symbolic elements such as a regal lion statue, subtly guarding the entrance. The composition should emphasize the central position of the Elizabeth Tower, making it the immediate focal point. The overall ambiance should convey a sense of history, authority, and the democratic process, using soft, diffused lighting to create a serene yet dignified atmosphere. The entire image should be strictly 2D, avoiding any 3D effects, and should exclude any text or numbers. The image ratio is 16:9, with the main subject positioned centrally. The goal is to create a memorable visual mnemonic that links Big Ben directly to the Houses of Parliament.
