A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a pastel color palette, depicting a historical progression. In the center of the 16:9 canvas, a sturdy, ancient Roman arch, symbolizing "community," serves as the foundational element. The arch is rendered in soft beige and cream tones. Emerging from the left side of the arch is a vibrant, bustling marketplace scene, filled with merchants trading goods, representing the "Economic" aspect of the EEC. The goods are diverse and colorful, subtly hinting at various European nations. The sky above the marketplace is a light, airy blue. As the arch extends to the right, the marketplace gradually transforms into a modern, interconnected cityscape, symbolizing the "Union." Buildings are sleek and modern, with subtle pastel blue and grey hues. Wind turbines are visible in the distance, representing modern collaboration and shared resources. The transition from the marketplace to the cityscape is seamless, indicating the evolution. The overall composition uses soft, diffused lighting to create a sense of historical continuity and positive progress. The absence of harsh lines and the pastel color palette contribute to a feeling of unity and harmony. The focus is sharp in the center, gently blurring at the edges to draw the viewer's eye towards the central transformation.
