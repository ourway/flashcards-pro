A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting a symbolic representation of the British Empire at its peak. The central focus is a large, stylized map of the world, predominantly shaded in pastel hues of red and blue, reminiscent of the Union Jack. Overlaid on this map are four distinct clusters of people, each cluster containing approximately 100 figures representing various ethnicities and cultures from across the historical Empire. These figures are illustrated in traditional attire, each group subtly distinct to represent different regions. The clusters are artfully arranged to not obscure the underlying map, but rather to emphasize the vast reach of the Empire. Above the map, a stylized sun, rendered in soft gold and yellow watercolor, is positioned, partially obscured by faint, wispy clouds, suggesting the phrase "the sun never sets on the British Empire." The overall composition evokes a sense of historical grandeur and geographical scale, using the number of people as the main subject matter, with the pastel color palette creating a soft, educational tone. The artistic style should lean towards realism, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, ensuring the image is both informative and visually appealing. The landscape orientation and 16:9 ratio should keep the main idea in the center.
