A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting depicting the Scottish Event Campus (SECC) in Glasgow, set against the backdrop of the River Clyde. The SECC's distinct architecture, including the Armadillo, should be accurately represented in a realistic style, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements. The colour palette should lean towards pastel shades, interspersed with hints of blue and white, reminiscent of the Scottish flag. The River Clyde flows in the foreground, reflecting the pastel sky, with stylized ripples suggesting movement and life.

In the immediate vicinity of the SECC, illustrate subtle scenes of Scottish culture: a faint outline of bagpipers playing, and stylized figures engaged in a traditional Highland dance, all rendered in pastel tones to blend seamlessly with the background. The composition should emphasize the SECC as the central focal point, a hub of activity and a landmark of Glasgow. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a welcoming and inviting atmosphere, avoiding harsh shadows or stark contrasts. The overall impression should be of a bustling cultural center nestled in the heart of Glasgow, a place of celebration and community, making the image memorable and educationally relevant.
