A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic British political cartoons, depicting the House of Commons. The scene focuses on the Speaker, positioned centrally, not on a throne, but on a raised chair, gavel in hand, presiding over a debate. The Speaker is dressed in traditional attire: a black gown, white bands, and possibly a wig. The House of Commons is filled with MPs sitting on benches facing each other, some gesturing animatedly as if in mid-debate. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with subtle accents of red and blue in the upholstery and details of the chamber, subtly referencing the UK flag. Architectural details of the House of Commons, such as the vaulted ceiling, ornate woodwork, and the opposing green and red benches, are rendered with precise accuracy. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a sense of gravitas and order. Symbolic elements include the Mace of the House of Commons prominently displayed on the table in front of the Speaker. The composition is balanced and symmetrical, emphasizing the Speaker's role as the focal point of authority and impartiality. The background is slightly blurred to keep the attention on the main subject. The overall feeling is one of formal decorum and historical significance.
