A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a serene English countryside scene. The focal point is a venerable apple tree with gnarled branches, its leaves a mix of lush green and autumnal gold, laden with ripe, red apples. Beneath the tree sits a contemplative Isaac Newton, portrayed as a young man with powdered hair and period attire, gazing upwards at a falling apple. The background features rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep, quintessential English cottages with thatched roofs, and a distant, hazy view of a quaint village church steeple. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues, with soft blues and greens dominating the landscape, accented by the vibrant red of the apples and the muted browns and creams of the buildings. Sunlight filters through the leaves, creating dappled shadows on the ground. The composition should evoke a sense of tranquility and intellectual curiosity, subtly emphasizing the English setting as the birthplace of Newton's profound scientific insights. The sky is a gentle gradient of pale blue and white, suggesting a clear, bright day. The artwork should be reminiscent of a classic English landscape painting, imbuing the scene with a timeless quality.
