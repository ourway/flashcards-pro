A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a classic watercolor painting. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, subtly incorporating hints of red, white, and blue to evoke the UK flag. The central focus is a depiction of three individuals seated at a slightly elevated bench within a courtroom setting, designed in a traditional British architectural style. The individuals are diverse in age and ethnicity, dressed in professional attire suitable for a formal setting, yet without overtly legalistic robes or wigs. In front of them, on a lower level, is a suggestion of a public gallery with blurred outlines of people, creating a sense of community presence. The background subtly includes elements of British architecture, such as arched windows with diffused light filtering through, and wood paneling. The overall mood should convey a sense of civic duty, fairness, and accessibility. The hand-drawn style should ensure that the image appears approachable and human, avoiding any sense of cold formality. The composition should be balanced, ensuring that the magistrates are the clear focal point while the surrounding elements contribute to the overall narrative of community service and the essence of unpaid work without formal legal dress. The artwork should exclude any text or numbers.
