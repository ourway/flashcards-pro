A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting the exterior of a classic British pub at midday. The pub, named "The Crown & Pint," features a traditional brick facade, a dark green painted door, and window boxes overflowing with vibrant red geraniums and trailing ivy. Sunlight streams down, casting a warm glow on the scene. The pub sign, hanging above the door, depicts a stylized golden crown above a frothy pint of ale. The door is slightly ajar, suggesting a welcoming atmosphere. Through the doorway, a glimpse of the warm, inviting interior can be seen – a cozy fireplace, dark wooden furniture, and the faint gleam of brass. A cobblestone path leads to the entrance, with a few scattered fallen leaves adding a touch of autumnal charm. The colour palette should be primarily pastel, with hints of red, white, and blue subtly incorporated into the details – the red geraniums, a white tablecloth barely visible through the window, and a blue painted bench beside the entrance. The sky above is a soft pastel blue, with fluffy white clouds drifting lazily by. The overall composition should evoke a sense of warmth, tradition, and the welcoming nature of British pubs, emphasizing the midday opening time.
