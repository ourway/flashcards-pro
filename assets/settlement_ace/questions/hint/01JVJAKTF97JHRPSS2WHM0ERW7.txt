A hand-drawn, realistic, 2D watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format, reminiscent of a vintage 1980s sports poster. The central focus is on a dynamic ice dancing duo, a female and a male, gracefully gliding across a shimmering ice rink. The female dancer has a flowing, pastel blue dress, while the male dancer sports a tailored pastel grey suit. Their poses should mirror each other, suggesting perfect synchronicity and balance. The background should fade from a deep royal blue at the top to a lighter, icy blue near the bottom, evoking the feeling of being in an arena. Subtle snowflakes should gently fall in the background. The style should lean towards realism, capturing the athleticism and artistry of ice dancing, while maintaining a soft, watercolour aesthetic. The overall colour palette should consist of pastel blues, greys, and whites, echoing the colours of ice and winter. The composition should highlight the movement and energy of the dance, with the couple positioned slightly off-center to create a sense of dynamism. The image should evoke a sense of nostalgia and the excitement of the 1984 Olympics, with a focus on elegance, precision, and the beauty of ice dancing.
