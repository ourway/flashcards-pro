A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of a vintage natural history plate, depicting a colony of giant ants (the 'Huge Protest-Ants'). These ants, rendered in shades of red and white with subtle blue accents on their antennae, are actively constructing a miniature Protestant church. The church is built from leaves and twigs, with a prominent steeple topped by a stylized cross. Some ants are carefully placing stained-glass windows made from translucent flower petals. Other ants are carrying miniature Bibles. The entire scene is set in a lush English garden, with dew-kissed grass and blooming roses in the background. The composition should be centered, filling the 16:9 landscape, with a focus on the ants' industrious activity and the delicate details of their construction. The colour palette should lean towards pastel hues, subtly incorporating the red, white, and blue of the Union Jack. The overall impression should be one of diligent faith and community spirit, visually linking the 'Huge Protest-Ants' to the Protestant faith through their architectural endeavor. The art style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and naturalistic observation.
