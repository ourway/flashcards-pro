A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant field of daffodils under a bright, pastel-blue sky. The field should stretch towards a gently rolling hill in the background, bathed in soft, morning light. Focus should be on the central cluster of daffodils in the foreground, their yellow petals catching the light, with subtle variations in color and form to give them a natural, lifelike appearance. Intertwined amongst the daffodils, almost hidden, is a quill pen, its nib gently touching one of the flower heads, symbolizing the act of writing and the connection to the poem's creation. The overall composition should evoke a sense of tranquility and natural beauty, reminiscent of the English Lake District. The color palette should be predominantly pastel yellows, greens, and blues, creating a calming and inviting scene. Small butterflies with pastel-colored wings flit amongst the flowers, adding a touch of whimsy. The sun should be positioned just above the horizon, casting long, soft shadows that add depth and dimension to the scene. The hand-drawn style should emphasize detail and texture, capturing the essence of a real landscape while subtly hinting at the poem's theme of nature and inspiration.
