A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, ratio 16:9, depicting the interior of the UK's House of Commons during a Speaker election. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly referencing the UK flag. In the center, a distinguished figure, partially obscured by shadow, is placing a folded ballot paper into a classical-style wooden ballot box, ornately carved with symbols of British parliamentary history (e.g., a small depiction of the Magna Carta). The ballot box is positioned on a small, ornate table draped with a blue cloth. Around the central figure, other members of Parliament are seated on green benches, their faces showing a mix of anticipation and solemnity. They are dressed in traditional parliamentary attire. Soft light filters through tall, arched windows, creating an atmosphere of secrecy and decorum. The overall composition emphasizes the hidden action of voting, with the shadow and folded paper symbolizing the privacy of the ballot. The background is softly blurred, drawing focus to the act of secret voting. The image should evoke a sense of British history and the importance of the democratic process, specifically the confidential nature of electing the Speaker.
