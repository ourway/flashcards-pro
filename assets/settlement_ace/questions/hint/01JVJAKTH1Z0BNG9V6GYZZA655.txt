A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, depicting a Norman knight kneeling before William the Conqueror in a verdant English field. The knight, clad in shining silver armor with subtle blue and red accents reminiscent of the Union Jack, offers his sword in fealty. William, seated on a simple wooden throne draped with a banner featuring three golden lions (a nod to the royal coat of arms), extends his hand in acceptance. Behind William, a rolling landscape unfolds, dotted with small villages and nascent castles, visually symbolizing the structured hierarchy of feudalism. The field in the foreground is divided into neat sections, representing the land distribution inherent in the feudal system. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, creating a serene yet authoritative atmosphere. The composition should emphasize the power dynamic between the knight and William, with the land itself serving as a backdrop that underscores the system of ownership and obligation. The sun should shine down from the top, indicating a new beginning and the establishment of a new order. Focus on the knight's armour, the banner, and the field layout to create a memorable visual mnemonic for the Normans and feudalism.
