A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, set against a backdrop of the Scottish Highlands bathed in the soft, pastel hues of a sunrise. Dominating the center of the 16:9 landscape composition is a stylized depiction of the modern Scottish Parliament building at Holyrood, Edinburgh. In the foreground, arranged symmetrically around the building, are ninety-nine (99) meticulously detailed bagpipers, each adorned in traditional Scottish tartan kilts, sporrans, and glengarries. Their bagpipes are actively being played, with visible puffs of air emanating from the chanters, creating a sense of harmonious sound and vibrant celebration. The bagpipers are diverse in age and appearance, reflecting the inclusive nature of Scottish society. Subtle, stylized thistle motifs are incorporated into the architectural details of the Parliament building and subtly embroidered on the bagpipers' kilts. The overall color palette leans heavily on pastel blues, purples, and greens, with accents of muted reds and yellows in the tartan patterns, evoking a sense of Scottish heritage and national pride. The lighting is soft and diffused, highlighting the architectural details of the Parliament and the intricate textures of the bagpipers' attire. The composition should convey a sense of historical significance, celebration, and the dawn of a new era for Scotland.
