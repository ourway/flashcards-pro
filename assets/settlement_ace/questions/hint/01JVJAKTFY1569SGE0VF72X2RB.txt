A watercolor illustration depicting a sunlit room with an open window at its center. The room is painted in soft, pastel hues, primarily blues and creams, reminiscent of a calm, intellectual environment. Sunlight streams through the open window, illuminating a diverse group of figures standing within the room. Each figure is distinct in appearance, representing a variety of ethnicities, ages, and styles of dress. They are all looking towards the window with expressions of contemplation and peace. Over each figure's head hovers a unique symbolic representation of their individual beliefs: a quill writing on parchment for one, a musical note for another, a mathematical symbol for a third, and a religious icon (such as a cross, star and crescent, or dharma wheel) for others. The symbols are translucent, allowing the sunlight to shine through them, emphasizing the idea that enlightenment illuminates all beliefs equally. The room contains simple, elegant furniture, such as a wooden table with a vase of white lilies, contributing to the atmosphere of serenity and intellectual freedom. The overall composition should convey a sense of openness, tolerance, and the celebration of diverse perspectives under the light of reason.
