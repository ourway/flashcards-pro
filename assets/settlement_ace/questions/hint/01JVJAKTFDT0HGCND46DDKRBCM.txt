A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting two central figures: Mo Farah and Jessica Ennis-Hill, bathed in golden light. The background showcases the iconic London skyline, subtly stylized with pastel blues and whites, evoking the atmosphere of the 2012 Olympic Games. Mo Farah is captured mid-stride, wearing his Team GB running kit, with a determined expression as he crosses a finish line. Jessica Ennis-Hill is depicted triumphantly holding a gold medal overhead, radiating joy. Both athletes are surrounded by a soft, golden aura that symbolizes their victory. The composition emphasizes the dynamic energy of the Olympic Games, with subtle hints of the British flag's colors incorporated into the crowd's attire. The overall mood is celebratory and inspiring, reflecting the spirit of the 2012 London Olympics and the athletes' remarkable achievements. The image should be strictly 2D and in a 16:9 landscape ratio, with the main focus on the athletes and the London skyline in the center. There should be no text or numbers in the image.
