A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style (16:9 ratio). The scene depicts a cozy, sunlit British cottage interior. The central focus is a weathered wooden table draped with a blue and white checkered tablecloth. On the table sits a Royal Mail envelope, partially opened, revealing a ballot paper inside. A magnifying glass rests beside the envelope, suggesting close examination. Soft pastel light streams in from a window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Outside the window, a quintessential English garden can be seen, overflowing with roses and lavender. A robin perches on the windowsill, looking inquisitively at the envelope. The colour palette leans heavily on pastel blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the Union Jack. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peace, accessibility, and democratic participation. The artistic style should be detailed and inviting, making the image memorable and easily associated with the concept of postal voting. The scene should avoid any overtly political messaging, focusing instead on the ease and accessibility of the postal ballot system within a comfortable, domestic setting.
