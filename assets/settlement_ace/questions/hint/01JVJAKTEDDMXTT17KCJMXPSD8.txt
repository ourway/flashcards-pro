A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour painting in a realistic style, depicting a serene Polish countryside scene violently disrupted. The scene is centered on a golden wheat field, swaying gently under a clear blue sky. A traditional Polish farmhouse, with its distinctive wooden architecture and red-tiled roof, sits peacefully in the background. However, the tranquility is shattered by the stark intrusion of dark, ominous shadows cast by German warplanes flying overhead. The shadows fall across the wheat field, creating a visual metaphor for the invasion. In the foreground, a single, broken white and red Polish flag lies discarded on the ground, partially obscured by the wheat. The overall colour palette should be predominantly pastel, with the golden wheat, blue sky, and green fields creating a sense of peace contrasted sharply with the dark shadows and the stark red of the flag. The composition should emphasize the idyllic Polish landscape being encroached upon by the looming threat, symbolizing the disruption and devastation caused by the invasion. The light should be soft and diffused, except for the harsh shadows, creating a dramatic contrast. The style should evoke a sense of historical realism, capturing the gravity of the event without being overtly graphic.
