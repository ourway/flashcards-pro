A heartwarming watercolor illustration depicting a serene countryside scene in early spring. In the center, a mother rabbit, adorned with a delicate floral crown, sits lovingly amidst a field of pastel-colored wildflowers â€“ primarily pale pinks, soft yellows, and gentle blues. Three smaller rabbit kits are gathered around her, one presenting her with a hand-picked bouquet of daffodils, another offering a painted egg, and the third snuggling close. The background features rolling green hills dotted with blossoming fruit trees, their branches laden with delicate pink and white flowers. In the distance, a church steeple rises gently from a quaint village nestled among the hills. The sky is a soft, diffused blue with gentle sunlight filtering through scattered clouds. Three prominent daffodils are in the foreground, symbolizing the three weeks before Easter. The overall style should evoke a sense of warmth, familial love, and the gentle awakening of spring. The color palette should be dominated by pastel shades, reminiscent of the UK flag's colors, with subtle hints of red in the ribbons tied around the flower bouquet and egg. The composition should be balanced and harmonious, drawing the viewer's eye towards the central image of the mother rabbit and her kits, creating a visual reminder of the timing of Mother's Day in relation to Easter.
