A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the Scottish Parliament Building nestled in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh, Scotland. The building should be the central focus, showcasing its modern architectural design with visible Scottish stone and glass elements. In the immediate foreground, depict a section of the Royal Mile leading towards the Parliament, bustling with subtly rendered figures representing diverse people. Behind the Parliament, paint a stylized and slightly blurred backdrop of Arthur's Seat, the iconic extinct volcano, rendered in soft, pastel greens and purples. The sky should be a blend of soft blues and whites, reminiscent of a typical Scottish day. In the lower corners of the image, incorporate subtle Scottish thistle motifs, almost like delicate embellishments. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades, with occasional pops of the Scottish blue and white. The composition should emphasize the harmonious blend of modern architecture with the historic landscape, using light and shadow to create depth and visual interest. The image should evoke a sense of place and history, creating a memorable visual association between the Scottish Parliament Building and Holyrood.
