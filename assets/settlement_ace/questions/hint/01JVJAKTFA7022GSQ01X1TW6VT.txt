A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a finely detailed, ornate British Parliament building viewed from across the River Thames. The building's architecture should be rendered with accurate details, emphasizing the grandeur and historical significance. A large, intricately woven safety net, colored in subtle shades of red, white, and blue, is suspended partially in front of the Parliament building. The net is positioned to visually catch any potential "falling" legislation, represented by stylized scrolls with red wax seals plummeting downwards. The sky should be rendered in pastel blues and whites with soft, diffused lighting, suggesting a contemplative atmosphere. The River Thames should be depicted with gentle ripples and reflections of the Parliament building and the safety net, using a pastel color palette. The overall composition should convey the idea of careful review and amendment. This image should evoke a sense of protection and thorough examination, visualizing the House of Lords' role in reviewing laws, and the safety net should be prominent without obscuring the Parliament building, which is the most important part of the UK government.
