A 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a somber scene representing "The Troubles" in Northern Ireland. The image, in a 16:9 landscape format, focuses on a street scene in Belfast during the conflict. The color palette predominantly features muted blues, grays, and reds, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag but in a desaturated, melancholic tone. The central element is a rain-slicked street with terraced houses on either side. Barricades constructed from corrugated iron and sandbags partially block the road, creating a sense of division and unrest. On one side of the barricade, a group of civilians huddle together, their faces etched with worry and anxiety. Amongst them are children, their expressions reflecting the tension of their environment. On the opposite side, a similar group is present, mirroring the division within the community. Puddles on the street reflect the somber colors of the sky and the buildings, amplifying the atmosphere of unease. Graffiti, rendered in faded reds and blacks, is visible on the walls, hinting at the underlying political tensions. In the background, a church steeple rises above the rooftops, symbolizing hope amidst the conflict. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of historical weight and the human cost of the conflict, emphasizing the "troubled" nature of the period without resorting to explicit violence or political messaging. The watercolour style adds a layer of softness and poignancy, highlighting the fragility of peace and the enduring impact of the Troubles on the community.
