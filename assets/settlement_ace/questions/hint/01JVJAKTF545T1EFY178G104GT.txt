A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a grand, ornate 18th-century study bathed in a warm, golden light. The scene is centered around a large, intricately carved mahogany desk. Upon the desk rests an open book, its pages seemingly glowing with an inner luminescence. Above the book, suspended as if by magic, is a single, clear glass lightbulb, emitting a soft, radiant glow that spreads throughout the room, chasing away shadows. The lightbulb is not modern; its filament is clearly visible, evoking the era of early electrical experimentation. Around the desk, various objects symbolic of intellectual pursuits are scattered: a quill pen resting on an inkwell, a celestial globe, a stack of leather-bound books, and a magnifying glass. The color palette should predominantly feature warm golds, ambers, and creams to emphasize the "enlightenment," contrasted with deep blues and reds reminiscent of the Union Jack flag subtly integrated into the room's decor, such as the upholstery on a nearby armchair and the pattern of a Persian rug. The overall composition should convey a sense of intellectual awakening and the dawn of new ideas, with the lightbulb serving as the central visual metaphor for 'the Enlightenment.' The ratio should be 16:9, and the main subject and idea should be mainly in the center of the image.
