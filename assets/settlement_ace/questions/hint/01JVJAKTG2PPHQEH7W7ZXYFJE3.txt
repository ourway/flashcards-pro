A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical painting, depicting Queen Elizabeth I receiving news of the English victory over the Spanish Armada. The image is in a 16:9 landscape format. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly invoking the colors of the UK flag. Queen Elizabeth I is the central figure, portrayed as regal and radiant, standing on the cliffs of Dover. Her attire is elaborate, featuring intricate embroidery and rich fabrics. In the background, a dynamic naval battle unfolds, with English ships bravely engaging the Spanish Armada. The English ships are smaller and more agile, while the Spanish galleons are larger but less maneuverable. The sea is turbulent, with white-capped waves and dark blue depths. Sunlight breaks through the clouds, illuminating the English fleet and casting shadows on the defeated Spanish ships. Symbolic elements include a crown resting on a table beside the Queen, symbolizing her authority and power. A messenger kneels before her, presenting a scroll detailing the victory. The overall composition conveys a sense of triumph, national pride, and the Queen's pivotal role in this historical event. The art style should evoke the feel of a Renaissance-era painting, with attention to detail in the depiction of ships, clothing, and facial expressions.
