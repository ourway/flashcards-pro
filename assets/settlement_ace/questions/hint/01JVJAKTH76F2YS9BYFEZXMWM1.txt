A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a scene outside the Houses of Parliament in London. The artwork should evoke a sense of historical significance and empowerment. The composition centers around a group of women, dressed in clothing typical of the early 20th century, holding banners advocating for voting rights. Predominantly pastel colors are used, with subtle hints of red, white, and blue echoing the UK flag. The background features the iconic clock tower of the Houses of Parliament, slightly blurred to maintain focus on the foreground figures. Among the crowd, two women stand out slightly more, one holding a banner that reads "Votes for Women" in very faded, almost illegible writing (ensuring no clear text is visible). The other woman is placing a flower at the base of an implied memorial (not explicitly shown, but suggested by the placement of flowers). The overall atmosphere should be one of quiet determination and historical weight, capturing the spirit of the women's suffrage movement and the year 1918, without directly depicting any numbers or text. Sunlight filters through the scene, casting soft shadows and highlighting the faces of the women, conveying hope and resilience. The style should be reminiscent of historical illustrations found in textbooks, aiming for clarity and memorability.
