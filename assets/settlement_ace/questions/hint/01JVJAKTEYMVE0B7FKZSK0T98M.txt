A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style (not cartoonish or abstract), depicting two distinct scenes side-by-side within a 16:9 landscape format. The color palette leans towards soft pastels, interspersed with subtle reds, whites, and blues reminiscent of the UK flag. On the left side, visualize a grand, ornate pipe organ, its golden pipes gleaming softly in the light of a stained-glass window depicting a Tudor rose. Delicate musical notes ascend from the organ, forming ethereal shapes that suggest Purcell's Baroque compositions. Intertwined with the pipes are subtle floral embellishments, including lavender and rosemary, symbolizing remembrance and musical inspiration. On the right side, portray a serene, rolling English countryside bathed in the golden light of late afternoon. In the distance, a majestic, ancient oak tree stands silhouetted against the sky, its branches reaching towards the heavens. Misty, dreamlike figures representing pastoral scenes and folk melodies emanate from the tree, symbolizing Vaughan Williams' connection to English folk music and his visionary compositions. A subtle wind rustles through the leaves, carrying musical notes that blend harmoniously with the sounds from the organ on the left. The overall composition should evoke a sense of tranquility, heritage, and the enduring legacy of British classical music.
