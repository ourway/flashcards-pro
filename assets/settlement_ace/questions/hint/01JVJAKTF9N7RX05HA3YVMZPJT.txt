A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical tapestries and illuminated manuscripts. The color palette leans towards the pastel spectrum, subtly echoing the red, white, and blue of the UK flag without directly replicating it. The central focus is a symbolic representation of the Hundred Years' War, not a literal battle scene. Envision two intertwining and aged oak trees, their roots firmly planted in separate, yet connected, landmasses: one side representing England (indicated by a subtle white rose bush growing near its base), the other France (represented by a delicate blue iris patch). The trees' branches are reaching towards each other, some intertwined in a complex knot, others broken and scarred, symbolizing the conflict and intertwined history. Dangling from the branches are 116 small, intricately designed paper lanterns, each uniquely shaped and softly illuminated. The lanterns are arranged in a seemingly random order, yet their sheer number visually emphasizes the extended duration of the war. The background depicts a rolling, misty landscape, blending the English countryside with the French Loire Valley, rendered in soft watercolor washes. The overall composition should evoke a sense of history, endurance, and the lasting impact of conflict, while remaining aesthetically pleasing and informative. The image should be free of any text or numbers.
