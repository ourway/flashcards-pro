A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting the Welsh Assembly chamber. The chamber is bathed in soft, natural light filtering through large arched windows. Dominating the center of the image is a single speaker's podium, intricately carved with Celtic knotwork designs. Two figures stand beside the podium. To the left, a figure dressed in traditional Welsh attire â€“ perhaps a tweed jacket and a daffodil pinned to their lapel. From the figure's mouth extends a flowing banner with the colors of the Welsh flag (red, white, and green) which is a visual representation of the Welsh language. To the right is another figure, dressed in a contemporary suit. From the figure's mouth extends a banner with the colours of the UK flag (red, white and blue) which visually represents the English language. These banners are coming together and overlapping, forming a harmonious blend of colors and representing the bilingual nature of the Welsh Assembly. The overall color palette should be in pastel colours.The background should feature stylized depictions of the Welsh landscape, with rolling green hills and distant mountains. The art style should be realistic, but with a touch of whimsical charm. The composition emphasizes the unity and connection between the two languages, highlighting the ability of AMs to communicate in both Welsh and English. The image should evoke a sense of cultural pride, linguistic diversity, and the importance of effective communication within the Welsh Assembly.
