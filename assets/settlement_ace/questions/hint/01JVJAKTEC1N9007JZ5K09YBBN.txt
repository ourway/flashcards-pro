A heartwarming, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a cozy Christmas scene. The central focus is a festively decorated dining table, draped with a red and white checkered tablecloth. Several golden-brown mince pies, dusted with powdered sugar, are arranged on a porcelain plate in the center of the table. Around the plate, arrange a collection of classic Christmas decorations: sprigs of holly with bright red berries, a string of twinkling fairy lights (glowing warm white and yellow), and a partially unwrapped gift tied with a red ribbon. In the background, a warm fireplace is subtly visible, casting a gentle glow on the scene. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades of red, green, and gold, evoking the warmth and joy of the Christmas season. The lighting should be soft and inviting, emphasizing the deliciousness of the mince pies and the festive atmosphere. The composition should be balanced, drawing the viewer's eye to the mince pies as the primary subject, while the surrounding decorations reinforce the association with Christmas. Ensure the image is strictly 2D, with no text or numbers, and maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio, with the main subject centered.
