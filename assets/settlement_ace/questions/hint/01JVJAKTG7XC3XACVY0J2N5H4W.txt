A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical portraiture. The scene depicts a young woman, Catherine Howard, adorned in a Tudor-era gown of pastel pink and white, with subtle hints of blue in the intricate embroidery. She stands in a grand hall with stone arches and stained-glass windows that cast soft, diffused light. The color palette should be primarily pastel, with touches of red and blue as accents, evoking a sense of historical elegance. Her left hand gently rests upon a large, ornately carved wooden table. On the table, prominently displayed, is a single, oversized Roman numeral "V" crafted from gold. The "V" is adorned with delicate floral carvings, but is clearly and unmistakably the focal point. Her expression is slightly melancholic, reflecting the tragic nature of her historical fate. The background is intentionally blurred, drawing the viewer's attention to Catherine and the Roman numeral. The overall composition is balanced and serene, aiming to create a memorable visual link between Catherine Howard and the number five, emphasizing that she was not the sixth, but the fifth wife of Henry VIII. The image should be 16:9 and landscape orientation. The main subject and idea should be mainly in the center of the image.
