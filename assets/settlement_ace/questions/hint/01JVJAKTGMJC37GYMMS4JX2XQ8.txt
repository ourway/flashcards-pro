A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The artwork centers around a solitary human skull resting upon a stack of aged, leather-bound books. The skull, rendered with anatomical accuracy, features subtle shading to emphasize its bone structure, and a faint, melancholic smile plays upon its skeletal features. The stack of books beneath it are of varying sizes and colors, their spines bearing faded gold lettering. The top book is slightly open, revealing blank pages with faint impressions of old script. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades of blue, red, and white, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag without being overt. Soft, diffused lighting illuminates the scene from above, casting gentle shadows that add depth and drama. In the background, a misty, impressionistic landscape evokes the moors of England. A single, wilting rose lies near the base of the stack, its petals a muted shade of red, symbolizing the ephemeral nature of life. The overall composition should be balanced and harmonious, conveying a sense of contemplation and the weight of existential questions. The artistic style should be reminiscent of classic portraiture, emphasizing realism and attention to detail.
