A hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style depicting a split scene, divided vertically down the center. The left side showcases a quill pen gracefully writing flowing lines of poetry on parchment, illuminated by candlelight, with faint imagery of sonnets and lyrical verses subtly woven into the background. The colour palette here is predominantly blue and white, reminiscent of the UK flag. The right side vividly portrays a theatrical stage during a performance of a Shakespearean play, with actors in elaborate costumes emoting dramatically under the warm glow of stage lights. The backdrop features a classic Elizabethan theatre design, and the colour palette here is predominantly red and white. The overall composition should be balanced, with the quill and stage equally prominent, symbolizing Shakespeare's dual mastery of poems and plays. The scene should evoke a sense of timeless artistry and cultural significance, with the colours subtly mirroring the UK flag. The image is set against a muted, pastel-coloured background to make the central imagery pop.
