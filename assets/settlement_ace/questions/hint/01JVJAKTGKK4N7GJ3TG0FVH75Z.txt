A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a symbolic tug-of-war across the Atlantic Ocean. On the left side of the frame, representing the American colonies, a group of determined figures dressed in revolutionary garb are pulling on a thick rope. Their faces are illuminated with the warm hues of sunrise, conveying a sense of hope and new beginnings. On the right side, symbolizing Great Britain, a stern, regal lion with a crown is also pulling on the rope, its expression conveying resistance. The lion is partially shrouded in the cool, muted blues and grays of a stormy sky, hinting at the challenges faced. In the center, where the rope stretches tautly across the ocean, the year "1776" is subtly embedded within the wave patterns of the sea using lighter shades of blue and white, almost like a ghostly watermark. The overall color palette should be primarily pastel, with soft reds, blues, and creams, evoking a sense of historical significance without being overly dramatic. The composition should emphasize the distance and tension between the two sides, with the Atlantic Ocean serving as a clear divider. The sunrise behind the American colonies should be brighter and more hopeful than the stormy sky over Britain, visually reinforcing the outcome of the conflict. The style should resemble a classic history textbook illustration, aiming for clarity and accuracy.
