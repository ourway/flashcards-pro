A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolour style, ratio 16:9. The scene is set in front of the Houses of Parliament in London, subtly recognizable by the iconic Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) in the background. In the center, a young adult, approximately 18 years old, is depicted holding a ballot paper. The young adult is smiling confidently, their face illuminated by the soft, warm light of a late afternoon sun. The ballot paper is predominantly white but has a very subtle, faded watermark of the Union Jack flag. The young adult is dressed in modern, casual clothing - a simple t-shirt and jeans, reflecting contemporary British society. Around the young adult, fading into the background with pastel colours, are faint representations of other civic duties and rights that come with adulthood, such as driving a car (represented by a steering wheel) and owning a home (represented by a simplified house shape). These elements are purposefully blurred and pastel-coloured to keep the focus on the central figure and the ballot paper. The overall colour palette should lean towards the pastel versions of the colours found in the British flag - muted reds, whites, and blues - creating a sense of civic duty and peaceful participation in democracy. The style should be reminiscent of classic watercolour illustrations, with soft edges and subtle blending of colours, giving it an approachable and educational feel.
