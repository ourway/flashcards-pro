A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image depicting a cross-section of British society, rendered in a realistic style with a pastel color palette reminiscent of aged parchment. The central focus is a stylized, slightly tilted set of scales, representing the scales of justice. On one side of the scale, balanced, are figures representing different professions and backgrounds: a teacher, a nurse, a construction worker, and a young graduate, all appearing between the ages of 18 and 70. These figures are drawn with soft, friendly expressions, suggesting their civic duty. On the other side of the scale, causing it to tip slightly, are two figures: one is a vibrant, energetic 17-year-old holding a voting card, symbolizing the right to vote but exclusion from jury duty, and the other is a relaxed, elderly gentleman of 71, holding a walking stick, representing retirement and also exclusion from jury duty. The background features a soft, blurred depiction of the Houses of Parliament, subtly reinforcing the British context. The overall composition is designed to be balanced and harmonious, with the pastel colors creating a calming and memorable image that illustrates the age range for jury service in the UK. The style should evoke a sense of classic British illustration, similar to storybook art. The image should be on 16:9 landscape ratio.
