A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a stylized, symmetrical heraldic composition set against a soft, pastel blue background. The central element is a shield divided vertically. On the left side, against a field of deep crimson, a meticulously rendered white rose, emblematic of the House of York, is displayed in full bloom. Each petal is carefully shaded to convey depth and texture. On the right side, against a field of pure white, a vibrant red rose, symbolizing the House of Lancaster, mirrors the York rose in form and detail. Subtle thorns are visible on the stems of both roses, hinting at the conflict. The background should be a soft, pastel blue, reminiscent of a clear English sky. The entire image should be framed by a delicate, hand-painted border of intertwined rose stems, with alternating red and white buds, creating a visually appealing and memorable representation of the Wars of the Roses and the houses of York and Lancaster. The composition should feel balanced and harmonious, despite the inherent tension of the subject matter. The color palette should lean towards pastel hues, with the red and white roses providing the main contrast, and should resemble the UK flag.
