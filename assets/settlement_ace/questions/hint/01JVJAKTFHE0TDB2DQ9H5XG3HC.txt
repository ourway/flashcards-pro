A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image in a 16:9 landscape ratio depicting a grand, simplified version of the Houses of Parliament at Westminster, bathed in the soft, early morning light. The color palette should primarily use pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly referencing the UK flag. In the heart of the image, positioned centrally, is a stylized yet realistically rendered beehive representing the civil service. Worker bees, depicted as tiny, diligent figures in miniature suits, are shown actively buzzing in and out of the hive, engaged in various tasks. Above and slightly behind the beehive, arrange a semi-circular table that symbolizes the Cabinet. Around the table, 10-12 figures are seated, each rendered with unique facial features and expressions suggesting deliberation and decision-making. These figures should appear important and formal, but not intimidating, wearing suits and ties. A soft light source illuminates the table, drawing attention to the figures. The background should feature a lightly sketched outline of iconic London landmarks like the Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben), blurred to maintain focus on the central subjects. The overall impression should be one of organized activity, collaborative effort, and the structured functioning of the UK government, with the beehive and the cabinet table serving as visual mnemonics for the civil service and the cabinet, respectively. The style should be realistically rendered, without being photographic, and should evoke a sense of trustworthiness, tradition, and diligent work.
