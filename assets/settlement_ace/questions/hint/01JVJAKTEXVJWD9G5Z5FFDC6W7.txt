A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, depicting a stylized round table setting. The table is made of light oak wood, polished to a soft sheen. Seated around the table are diverse figures, each representing a different nation within the Commonwealth. They are dressed in traditional clothing that subtly reflects their cultural heritage, yet with a modern, collaborative feel. The figures are engaged in friendly discussion, some gesturing with open hands, others leaning forward attentively.

At the center of the table, instead of a traditional centerpiece, there is a stylized representation of intertwined plants, their leaves a mix of greens and pastel blues, symbolizing growth, collaboration, and shared roots. Soft, natural light filters in from an unseen window, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the warmth of the scene. The background is a muted blend of blues and creams, resembling a world map, subtly hinting at the global reach of the Commonwealth. The overall color palette should evoke a sense of unity, peace, and shared progress, using pastel shades reminiscent of the UK flag's colors but softened for a gentle, inviting aesthetic. The composition should be balanced, with the round table and figures centrally focused to emphasize the collaborative nature of the Commonwealth.
