A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image in a realistic style, depicting a serene hospital ward scene during the Victorian era (19th century). The color palette leans towards pastel blues, whites, and soft reds, subtly echoing the UK flag. The central focus is Florence Nightingale, portrayed as a compassionate figure in her iconic nurse's uniform, holding a softly glowing oil lamp. She is gently tending to a wounded soldier lying in a crisp white bed. Around her, other nurses are similarly caring for patients in an orderly, clean environment. The ward is illuminated by the warm light of several oil lamps, casting long, soft shadows that emphasize the solemnity and dedication of the scene. A vintage medicine trolley stands nearby, laden with bottles and bandages. In the background, almost faded into the scene, there is a subtle hint of a book, alluding to knowledge and learning, but the primary focus remains on Nightingale's nursing work. The overall composition should evoke a sense of calm dedication and the significance of Florence Nightingale's contributions to healthcare and nursing reform, not education. The hospital setting should be distinctly Victorian, with architectural details and medical equipment accurate to the period.
