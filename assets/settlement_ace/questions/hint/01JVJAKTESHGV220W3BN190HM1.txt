A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, rendered in a pastel colour palette. The central focus is on a determined, middle-aged man, Ernest Rutherford, depicted in the style of a distinguished scientist from the early 20th century, with neatly combed hair and spectacles perched on his nose. He stands at the edge of a swirling, stylized river of iridescent, interconnected spheres representing atoms. The river originates from a misty, mountainous landscape in the background, subtly reminiscent of the rolling hills of the English countryside. Rutherford is holding a staff-like device that emits a beam of light, visually 'splitting' the flow of the atomic river into two distinct streams. The splitting point is depicted with a burst of gentle light and swirling energy. The overall composition should convey a sense of scientific discovery and controlled power, with the pastel colours lending a gentle, educational tone. The river and the atoms within should be rendered with intricate detail, showcasing their dynamic movement and interconnectedness. The sky above should be a soft, watercolour wash of pale blues and pinks, adding to the overall dreamlike quality of the scene. The entire image should be framed within a 16:9 aspect ratio, with the main action concentrated in the center.
