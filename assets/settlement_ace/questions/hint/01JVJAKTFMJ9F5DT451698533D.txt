A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting Robert the Bruce leading the Scottish army to victory at the Battle of Bannockburn. The art style should evoke a sense of historical grandeur and heroic leadership. Robert the Bruce, clad in shining (but not overly bright) silver armor with a blue Scottish Saltire emblazoned on his chest, is positioned in the center of the 16:9 frame. He is mounted on a powerful, muscular warhorse, its coat a deep chestnut brown. His face, weathered but determined, is framed by a dark beard and flowing hair. He raises his sword, not as a weapon but as a symbol of Scottish resolve. The background features the rolling hills of Bannockburn, rendered in muted greens and browns. The Scottish army, a sea of blue and white banners, surges forward behind him, their faces reflecting courage and determination. Spears and shields are visible, but not overly emphasized to avoid a chaotic scene. The sky above is a dramatic mix of blues and grays, hinting at the tumultuous battle. The overall color palette leans towards the blues and whites of the Scottish flag, with accents of earthy tones to ground the scene in its historical setting. The composition should convey a sense of forward momentum and unwavering Scottish spirit, capturing the pivotal moment of Robert the Bruce leading his army to a decisive victory. The image should focus on the bravery of Robert the Bruce and the Scottish army, with no hint of violence or gore.
