A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style depicting St. George triumphantly standing over a defeated dragon. The scene is set within a quintessential English landscape, featuring rolling green hills dotted with blooming apple orchards, subtly alluding to the month of April and the arrival of spring. St. George is clad in shining silver armor with a prominent red cross emblazoned on his chest, mirroring the English flag. His helmet is off, revealing a determined yet serene expression. The dragon, rendered in shades of emerald and forest green, lies vanquished but not grotesque, its form artfully integrated into the landscape. Sunlight streams through the clouds, illuminating St. George and casting a gentle glow on the surrounding countryside. In the foreground, three daisies are prominently displayed, the petals of one daisy coloured blue, another red and the last one white, to symbolise the UK flag. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues, primarily blues, reds, greens, and whites, creating a visually appealing and memorable image. The composition should be centered, with St. George and the dragon as the primary focal points, ensuring a balanced and harmonious arrangement. The image should evoke a sense of national pride, courage, and the triumph of good over evil, serving as a strong visual mnemonic for the date of St. George's Day.
