A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image on a 16:9 canvas, depicting the Palace of Westminster in London. The Houses of Parliament are bathed in the soft glow of a sunrise, rendered in pastel shades of blue, pink, and a hint of gold. In the foreground, a majestic, stylized European flag is draped gently over a symbolic set of scales, representing justice and rights. The flag's colors are muted and pastel, contributing to the overall serene and thoughtful atmosphere. Behind the scales, partially obscured but clearly visible, is a quill pen resting on an open book, symbolizing the written word and human rights documents. A delicate, ornate frame surrounds the entire scene, reminiscent of classic British illustrations. Above the Houses of Parliament, a flock of doves, rendered in shades of white and pale grey, ascend towards the sky, symbolizing peace and freedom. The composition focuses on the central area of the image, highlighting the relationship between the Council of Europe (represented by the flag) and the concept of law-making (represented by the Houses of Parliament and the quill). The overall tone of the image is one of thoughtful consideration and the careful balance of rights and responsibilities, subtly conveying the message that the Council of Europe deals with rights, but does not have the power to enact laws. The art style is realistic and detailed, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, making it suitable for educational purposes.
