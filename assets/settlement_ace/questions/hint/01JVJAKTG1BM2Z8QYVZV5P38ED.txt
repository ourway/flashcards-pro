A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting Mount Snowdon in Wales. The image should fill a 16:9 landscape canvas, with the mountain range centrally positioned. The peak of Snowdon is prominently featured, covered in a dusting of snow suggesting its height and the origin of its name, but not entirely snow-covered. The mountain should be rendered with detailed rock textures, showcasing its rugged terrain. The foreground should feature a vibrant, green Welsh landscape with patches of heather and grazing sheep to emphasize the location. A winding path can be seen leading towards the summit, hinting at its accessibility. The sky is a soft pastel blue with scattered clouds. The overall color palette leans towards blues, greens, and whites, subtly reflecting the colors of the UK flag and a pastel aesthetic. The light source is from the left, casting gentle shadows that accentuate the mountain's form and add depth to the scene. The image should evoke a sense of the British countryside and the natural beauty of Wales. The aim is to create a memorable visual association between the name "Snowdon" and the concept of a grand, snow-touched mountain.
