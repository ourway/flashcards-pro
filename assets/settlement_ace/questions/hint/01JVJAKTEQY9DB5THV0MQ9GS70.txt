A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in watercolor style, depicting a classic British telephone booth situated on a bustling London street. The scene should be framed in a 16:9 landscape orientation, with the telephone booth as the central focus. The colour palette should be primarily pastel hues, subtly incorporating the red, white, and blue of the UK flag in muted tones. The telephone booth is rendered realistically, showing slight wear and tear, indicative of its public use. Inside the booth, a wisp of grey smoke curls upwards, partially obscuring a hand holding a lit cigarette. Above the smoker's head, prominently displayed on the glass of the telephone booth, is a universally recognizable 'No Smoking' symbol: a red circle with a diagonal line across a cigarette. The street outside the booth is alive with activity: pedestrians stroll by, some glancing curiously at the booth, while iconic red double-decker buses rumble past in the background. The overall composition aims to create a visual mnemonic, associating the act of smoking in a prohibited area (the telephone booth) with a subtle sense of transgression and public awareness, emphasizing that such an action constitutes a criminal offense. The art style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, to ensure clarity and educational impact.
