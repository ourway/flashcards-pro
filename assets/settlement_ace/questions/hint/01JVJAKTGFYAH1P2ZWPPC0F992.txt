A realistically styled, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a distinguished medical researcher, John MacLeod, in a laboratory setting. The color palette leans heavily on pastel blues, whites, and reds, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag. MacLeod, a middle-aged man with neatly combed hair and a kind face, is dressed in a traditional white lab coat. He is holding a glass vial filled with a shimmering, translucent liquid representing insulin. The lab is filled with vintage scientific equipment: glass beakers, copper tubing, and meticulously labeled bottles. Sunlight streams in through a window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, adding a sense of historical authenticity. Behind MacLeod, there's a subtly rendered Scottish thistle, a nod to his Scottish heritage. In the background, a faint, ethereal image of a person receiving an insulin injection symbolizes the life-saving impact of his discovery. The overall composition is balanced, with MacLeod as the central figure, radiating an aura of scientific dedication and groundbreaking achievement. The art style should have a gentle, educational feel, avoiding harsh lines or overly dramatic shading, and the image should evoke a sense of calm, focused scientific pursuit.
