A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a bustling British high street scene rendered in a pastel color palette. The main focus is a stack of neatly arranged, antique-looking ledgers, subtly tinted in shades of red, white, and blue, representing the UK flag. A quill pen rests elegantly on top of the stack. Emanating upwards from the ledgers are various symbolic elements: a miniature terraced house with a "For Sale" sign (representing property income), a tiny, overflowing piggy bank (representing savings), and a stylized tree bearing fruit shaped like pound sterling symbols (representing dividends). To the left of the ledgers, a craftsman in a leather apron is shown diligently working at his bench, representing self-employment, and a single beam of light illuminates his workspace. To the right, a silhouette of a family enjoying their home is depicted, reinforcing the concept of property ownership. The overall composition should convey a sense of prosperity and industry, carefully balanced with the responsibility of taxation. The background features a soft-focus rendering of iconic London landmarks such as Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. The image should evoke a sense of timelessness and enduring British values, subtly reminding the viewer that these sources of income are subject to taxation. The image should be 16:9.
