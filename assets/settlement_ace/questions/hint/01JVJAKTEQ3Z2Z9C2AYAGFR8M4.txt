A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image depicting the Houses of Parliament in London, bathed in the soft light of a late afternoon. The iconic Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) stands prominently, its clock face showing 3 o'clock. The architectural details of the Palace of Westminster are rendered with precision. In the foreground, a diverse group of people—families, students, tourists—are depicted casually strolling towards the entrance of the building. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly mirroring the colors of the Union Jack. The scene should convey a sense of openness and accessibility, with the main doors of Parliament clearly visible and inviting. Sunlight reflects gently off the River Thames in the background. The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements. The image should evoke a feeling of British heritage and democratic values, emphasizing the welcoming nature of the Parliament building. No barriers or ticket booths are visible, reinforcing the idea of free access. The composition should draw the viewer's eye towards the open doors and the diverse crowd entering.
