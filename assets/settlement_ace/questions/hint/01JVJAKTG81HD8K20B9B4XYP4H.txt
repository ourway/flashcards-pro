A watercolour painting in a realistic style, 16:9 landscape orientation. The central image shows a young person, around 16 years old, standing in a silhouette form, facing away from the viewer. They are positioned in the center of the frame. The silhouette is filled with a muted, pastel blue, reminiscent of a twilight sky. Emanating from behind the silhouette is a soft, warm golden light that creates a gentle halo effect. In front of the silhouette, several stylized newspaper cutouts are floating mid-air. These cutouts are rendered in grayscale and have blurred, indistinct headlines and images, suggesting media publications. Each newspaper has a prominent red 'X' painted over it, as if censoring the content. The background is a soft, gradient blend of pastel blues and whites, suggesting a peaceful and protective atmosphere. The overall composition is designed to evoke a sense of privacy, protection, and the importance of safeguarding the identity of young individuals. The watercolour style gives the image a gentle, approachable feel, appropriate for educational content. The colour palette is reminiscent of the UK flag through the use of blues and white.
