A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a dramatic, yet historically sensitive, depiction of Archduke Franz Ferdinand leading a stylized charge. He is not depicted at the moment of assassination, but rather as a strong, forward-looking leader. He rides a majestic, yet grounded, warhorse, its coat a dappled grey. The horse is adorned with subtle imperial regalia, avoiding overt displays of power. Ferdinand wears a simplified military uniform of the era, primarily in muted blues and reds reminiscent of the UK flag palette, avoiding any harsh or aggressive tones. His expression is determined but not bellicose. Behind him, a stylized, almost ethereal, representation of soldiers follows, their forms blending into a smoky, pastel-coloured backdrop. The background transitions from a bright, hopeful dawn on the left side of the frame, symbolizing the pre-war era, to a more turbulent, greyish hue on the right, hinting at the impending conflict. Above Ferdinand, a single soaring dove, rendered in delicate white, flies towards the brighter dawn, a symbol of lost peace. The overall style should evoke a sense of historical weight and solemnity, avoiding any glorification of war. The composition should guide the eye from left to right, suggesting the chronological progression towards the First World War.
