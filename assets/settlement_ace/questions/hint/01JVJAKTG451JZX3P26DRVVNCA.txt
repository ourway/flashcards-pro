A serene, hand-drawn watercolor landscape depicting the Welsh coastline near Swansea. The composition centers on a graceful swan gliding across a calm bay, its reflection shimmering in the water. Rolling green hills dotted with traditional Welsh cottages rise gently in the background. A medieval stone castle, partially in ruins, stands atop the highest hill, overlooking the bay. The sky is a soft, pastel blue, with fluffy white clouds drifting lazily. The overall color palette leans towards the soft blues, greens, and whites of the Welsh landscape, interspersed with touches of red in the form of blooming wildflowers along the coastline. The swan should be particularly detailed, with careful attention paid to its feathers and the gentle ripples it creates in the water. The scene should evoke a sense of tranquility and natural beauty, highlighting the connection between Swansea, the swan, and the Welsh landscape. The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, to enhance the educational impact. The image should be suitable for educational purposes and for viewers of all ages.
