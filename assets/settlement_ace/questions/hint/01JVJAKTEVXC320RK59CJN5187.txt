A watercolor illustration in a pastel color palette (primarily soft pinks, blues, and creams) depicting a large, stylized heart functioning as a calendar. The heart-calendar is subtly textured to resemble handmade paper. A single, torn-off page from the heart-calendar floats gently downwards. The torn edge is slightly ragged and uneven. The floating page is also heart-shaped and colored a deeper shade of pink. On the floating page, two intertwined roses, one red and one white, are painted with delicate detail, their stems forming a stylized number "14". Above the roses, painted in a flowing, elegant script resembling calligraphy, is the word "February," rendered in a soft blue hue. The background is a hazy, dreamlike wash of blended pinks and blues, evoking a romantic and gentle atmosphere. The composition should be balanced, with the heart-calendar centered and the floating page slightly offset to create a sense of movement. The overall impression should be one of tenderness, romance, and a gentle reminder of the date. The art style should mimic a classic, hand-painted Valentine's card.
