A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting the public entrance of the UK Parliament building (Palace of Westminster) on a bright, overcast day. The style should be realistic, mirroring the architectural grandeur of the building with accurate depictions of its stonework, windows, and iconic clock tower (Elizabeth Tower, housing Big Ben) subtly visible in the background. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel shades of blue, red and white, subtly evoking the colors of the Union Jack. In the foreground, a diverse group of people are patiently queueing in an orderly line at the public entrance. Their attire should be varied, representing the multicultural nature of the UK. The expressions on their faces should convey anticipation and curiosity. An ethereal, almost dreamlike quality should permeate the scene, suggesting the accessibility and openness of the UK Parliament to the public. The composition should focus on the line of people leading towards the entrance, drawing the viewer's eye to the symbolic doorway. The atmosphere should be welcoming and democratic, emphasizing the idea of free access to the heart of British politics. The architectural details of the Palace of Westminster should be rendered with precision, highlighting its historical significance and importance.
