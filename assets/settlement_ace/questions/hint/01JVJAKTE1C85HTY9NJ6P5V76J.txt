A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Tower of London at daytime, bathed in soft, diffused sunlight. The iconic White Tower should be central, its stonework rendered with careful attention to texture and detail. Emerging from the top of the White Tower, a stylized beam of light shines upwards, illuminating a cluster of symbolic, oversized Crown Jewels – a jeweled crown, scepter, and orb – glittering with pastel-colored sapphires, rubies, and emeralds. The jewels should appear almost ethereal, as if floating, suggesting their precious and protected status. The surrounding grounds should feature hints of green grass and other buildings within the Tower complex, rendered in muted pastel colors. A few Beefeater guards in their traditional scarlet uniforms should be subtly placed in the foreground, adding a touch of historical authenticity. The sky should be a soft, watercolor blue, with gentle gradients suggesting depth and distance. The overall composition should evoke a sense of history, majesty, and the secure safekeeping of national treasures, framed within a 16:9 landscape orientation.
