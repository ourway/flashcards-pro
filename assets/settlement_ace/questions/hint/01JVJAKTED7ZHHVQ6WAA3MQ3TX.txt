A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting the Welsh countryside under a clear sky, rendered in a realistic style. Rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep stretch towards a distant mountain range, evoking the geography of Wales. In the foreground, a stylized, yet realistic depiction of the Senedd building (Welsh Parliament) stands bathed in sunlight. From the Senedd, a beam of light in a pastel green hue, symbolizing "health," emanates outwards, touching various scenes representing health services throughout Wales. One scene shows a nurse attending to a patient in a modern hospital room. Another depicts a doctor examining a child in a rural clinic. A third scene shows a community garden with people tending to vegetables, representing preventative healthcare and well-being. Each scene is subtly linked to the Senedd by the continuous pastel green light, visually representing the Welsh Assembly's legislative power over health services. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades with accents of red and white, subtly referencing the Welsh flag. The composition should be balanced, with the Senedd centrally positioned and the surrounding scenes radiating outwards, emphasizing its central role in governing health services. The style should be reminiscent of classic watercolor landscape paintings, creating a serene and trustworthy feel, appropriate for educational content.
