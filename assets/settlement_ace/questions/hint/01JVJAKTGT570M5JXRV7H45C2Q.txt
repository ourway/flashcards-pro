A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting two distinct horse-racing scenes, each representing a key event. The composition is divided horizontally. The top half showcases a vibrant scene from Royal Ascot: Elegant spectators in elaborate hats and formal attire line the racecourse, their figures slightly blurred to convey motion and the excitement of the event. Thoroughbred horses, rendered with anatomical accuracy, race towards the finish line, jockeys clad in brightly colored silks. The background features the iconic Ascot grandstand, painted in soft, pastel hues. The lower half portrays a scene from the Scottish Grand National: A more rugged landscape with rolling green hills and a challenging steeplechase course. Horses and jockeys, spattered with mud, navigate formidable fences. The crowd here is dressed in more practical attire, reflecting the Scottish setting. In the far background, a hint of the Scottish Highlands provides context. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, interspersed with the bold reds and blues of the jockeys' silks and the UK flag, subtly incorporated through the color choices in the background elements of each scene. The image should convey the contrasting atmospheres of the two events – the refined elegance of Royal Ascot and the more earthy, challenging nature of the Scottish Grand National – while clearly depicting the central theme of prominent horse-racing events in the UK.
