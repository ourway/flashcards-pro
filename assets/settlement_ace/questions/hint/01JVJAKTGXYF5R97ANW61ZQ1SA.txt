A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a stylized British Isles archipelago viewed from above. The landmass representing Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) is rendered in vibrant, unified shades of pastel green, blue, and white, subtly mimicking the colors of the Union Jack flag. Rolling hills, quaint villages, and iconic landmarks like a small representation of Edinburgh Castle and Stonehenge are delicately painted on this unified landmass. To the west, separated by a stretch of pastel blue ocean with gentle waves, lies the island of Ireland. Ireland is distinctively colored in a soft, muted pastel green, visually separate from the rest of Great Britain. A barely visible, dotted line originates from Great Britain and extends towards Ireland but stops short, symbolizing a disconnection. The overall composition is gentle and clear, aiming for educational clarity rather than dramatic effect. The sky is a soft, pastel blue with fluffy white clouds, adding to the serene and informative tone. The ratio is 16:9 with the archipelago centered, ensuring focus on the geographical distinction. The image should contain no text.
