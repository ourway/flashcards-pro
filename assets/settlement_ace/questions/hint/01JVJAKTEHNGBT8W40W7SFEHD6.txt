A hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image in a realistic style depicting the Normandy coastline on the morning of D-Day. The image should be in a 16:9 landscape ratio, with a pastel color palette dominated by blues, grays, and sandy beige, reminiscent of the UK flag's colors. The central focus is on the beach, where landing crafts are approaching the shore. Soldiers in WWII-era uniforms are disembarking from the crafts, wading through the water towards the beach. The composition is designed to convey a sense of forward movement and determination. The sky is overcast, with subtle gradients of gray and blue, adding to the somber atmosphere. In the background, subtly suggest the presence of the French countryside, with rolling hills and small villages barely visible through the mist. The overall impression should be historical, educational, and evocative of the scale and significance of the D-Day landings. The image should not be cartoonish or abstract, it should aim for a realistic and historically accurate representation to aid in recall. The main subject and idea should be mainly in the center of the image (16:9 ratio boundaries).
