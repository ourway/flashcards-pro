A watercolor illustration in a realistic style, ratio 16:9, focusing on a traditional Scottish Highlands scene. The main subject is a meticulously drawn haggis, presented on a wooden platter in the center of the image. The haggis should appear savory and appetizing, with visible texture suggesting its meat and oatmeal composition. Surrounding the haggis are sprigs of fresh thyme and rosemary, adding to the visual appeal and hinting at the dish's flavor profile. Behind the platter, depict a blurred background of the Scottish Highlands: rolling green hills, a loch reflecting a pastel blue sky, and a few grazing sheep. The color palette should primarily use muted, earthy tones like browns, greens, and creams, complemented by the pastel blues of the sky and water. A subtle, warm light source from the upper left should cast gentle shadows, highlighting the texture of the haggis and adding depth to the scene. The overall composition should evoke a sense of warmth, tradition, and the natural beauty of Scotland. The hand-drawn style should emphasize detail and realism, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements. The illustration should aim to create a mouth-watering and memorable visual association with haggis and its Scottish origins.
