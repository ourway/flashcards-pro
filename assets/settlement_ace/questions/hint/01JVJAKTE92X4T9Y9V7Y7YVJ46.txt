A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classical scientific illustrations. The composition is centered, adhering to a 16:9 aspect ratio. The scene depicts a serene night sky, rendered in deep blues and purples, transitioning to lighter pastel blues near the horizon. Streaking across the upper portion of the sky is a vibrant comet with a long, luminous tail composed of red, white, and blue hues, echoing the colours of the UK flag. The comet is prominently labeled with a subtle, ethereal glow around it. Below the comet, occupying the lower portion of the frame, is a sprawling apple orchard. A single apple, rendered in realistic detail with shades of red and green, is depicted mid-fall from a tree branch. The tree itself is mature and laden with fruit, its leaves a mix of greens and autumnal browns. Beneath the tree, at the point of impact for the falling apple, lies a notebook and quill, subtly suggesting scholarly activity. The overall lighting is soft and diffused, creating a sense of wonder and intellectual curiosity. The scene evokes a sense of historical significance and scientific discovery, with the comet representing Halley and the falling apple representing Newton, both original members of the Royal Society.
