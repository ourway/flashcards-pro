A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9, depicting the historical spread of Protestant ideas in the 16th century. The central focus is a stylized yet realistic depiction of a printing press, rendered in warm, aged wood tones with brass accents. Emerging from the printing press is a series of stylized scrolls, each unfurling outwards like waves spreading across a calm sea. These scrolls are subtly colored in pastel blues and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag's color palette. Each scroll features faint, almost ethereal illustrations of key figures associated with the Protestant Reformation, such as Martin Luther, rendered in a minimalist yet recognizable style. The background features a soft, blurred landscape of 16th-century European architecture, with castles and cathedrals silhouetted against a dawn sky, colored in gentle hues of rose and lavender. The overall composition is designed to convey a sense of historical significance and the widespread dissemination of new ideas. The light source emanates from the printing press, illuminating the scrolls and symbolizing the enlightenment brought about by the Reformation. The art style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and scholarly pursuit, steering clear of cartoonish or abstract representations.
