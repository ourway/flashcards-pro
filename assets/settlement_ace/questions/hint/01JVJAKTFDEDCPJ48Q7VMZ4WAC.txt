A watercolour illustration depicting a panoramic view of the Scottish Highlands. The scene should be dominated by majestic, mist-covered mountains in the background, their peaks gently fading into a soft, pastel blue sky. In the foreground, a vibrant green valley stretches out, dotted with traditional stone crofts with thatched roofs. A winding river, reflecting the sky's gentle hues, cuts through the valley floor. Scattered across the landscape are figures representing Highland clansmen, clad in traditional tartan kilts of various patterns dominated by blues and greens, with sporrans and bonnets. Some are gathered around a small campfire, while others stand on rocky outcrops, gazing towards the distant mountains. Include details like heather bushes in bloom, their purple flowers adding pops of colour to the landscape. The overall style should evoke a sense of romanticism and rugged beauty, reminiscent of classic Scottish landscape paintings. Use a pastel colour palette, with soft blues, greens, and browns, to create a tranquil yet powerful atmosphere. The lighting should be soft and diffused, highlighting the textures of the landscape and the details of the clansmen's attire. The composition should be balanced, with the mountains, valley, and figures all contributing to a cohesive and visually appealing scene.
