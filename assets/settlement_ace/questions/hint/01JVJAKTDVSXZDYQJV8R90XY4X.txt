A whimsical, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a stylized, oversized cuckoo clock, painted in pastel blues and creams, reminiscent of traditional British seaside colors. The clock face is adorned with delicate floral patterns instead of numerals. The clock's cuckoo bird, instead of appearing on the hour, is depicted mid-flight, releasing a small flock of birds, totaling fifteen in number. These birds are various native UK species, like robins, blue tits, and chaffinches, each carefully detailed. The clock hands are positioned at three o'clock, rendered in a slightly darker shade of blue for contrast. To the right of the clock, a stylized hand, also in pastel tones, is open with all five fingers extended towards the flock of birds, as if counting them. The backdrop is a soft, hazy landscape featuring rolling green hills and a faint outline of mountains in the distance, evoking the diverse landscapes found within the UK's National Parks. The overall composition should aim for a dreamy, educational feel, making the number fifteen visually prominent through the flock of birds while subtly alluding to the multiplication hint with the clock striking three and the open hand displaying five fingers. The style should be reminiscent of classic children's book illustrations, promoting easy comprehension and memorability.
