A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting James Cook standing on the deck of the HMS Endeavour. The ship is sailing along the vibrant, ochre-red coastline of Australia, detailed with recognizable landmarks like the Sydney Opera House in the far distance. James Cook is portrayed with a powdered wig and naval uniform, holding a detailed nautical chart in one hand and a quill pen in the other. His gaze is fixed on the coastline, conveying a sense of discovery and meticulous surveying. In the sky above, celestial navigation instruments like a sextant are subtly integrated as decorative elements. The sea is a mix of deep blues and greens, suggesting the vastness of the ocean. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, evoking a sense of historical authenticity and the era of exploration. The composition is centered, with the ship and coastline dominating the frame, emphasizing Cook's role in charting the land. Small details like seabirds flying overhead and the ship's flag waving in the wind enhance the sense of realism and historical context. The illustration style should resemble classic nautical illustrations, emphasizing precision and detail.
