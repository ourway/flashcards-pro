A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, showcasing a panoramic view of the Palace of Westminster (Houses of Parliament) bathed in the soft, golden light of a late afternoon. The architectural style should be prominently displayed, emphasizing the Gothic Revival elements: pointed arches, ribbed vaults, flying buttresses, and ornate decorations. The clock tower, Big Ben, should be clearly visible, its intricate details rendered with precision. In the foreground, the River Thames flows gently, reflecting the warm sunlight and the imposing structure of the Palace. The color palette should be dominated by pastel shades of blue, red and white, reminiscent of the UK flag, subtly integrated into the stonework and the sky. The overall composition should evoke a sense of grandeur, history, and architectural beauty. The style should closely resemble a detailed architectural illustration from the 19th century, with an emphasis on accurate proportions and realistic textures. The sky should be a blend of soft blues, pinks, and whites, creating a serene and awe-inspiring atmosphere. No text should be present in the image.
