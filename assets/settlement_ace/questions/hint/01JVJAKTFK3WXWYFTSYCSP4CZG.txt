A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a symbolic representation of Wales and Scotland within the United Kingdom. The composition is set against a backdrop reminiscent of the UK flag's colors, primarily using a pastel color palette. Centered in the frame is a majestic, emerald-green Welsh Dragon, its scales intricately detailed and its posture proud and alert, breathing a wisp of cloud. Juxtaposed on the right side of the dragon is a set of traditional Scottish bagpipes, crafted from polished wood and adorned with tartan fabric in hues of blue, green, and red. Wisps of music seem to emanate from the bagpipes, swirling around the instrument. The base of the dragon is set on a field of daffodils, the national flower of Wales, while the base of the bagpipes rests on a patch of blooming thistles, the national flower of Scotland. Subtle rolling hills are visible in the background, colored in shades of green and heather purple, evoking the landscapes of both countries. The overall atmosphere is one of cultural pride and historical significance, designed to be both educational and visually captivating. The image ratio is 16:9.
