A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the Tower of London, focusing on two Beefeaters standing guard near the entrance. The Beefeaters are rendered in realistic detail, showcasing their iconic scarlet and gold Tudor-style uniforms, complete with tall bearskin hats. Their faces should convey a sense of dignified history and unwavering duty. One Beefeater is holding a halberd, reflecting the sun with a metallic sheen, while the other stands at attention. Behind them, the Tower of London rises majestically, its ancient stone walls aged and weathered, with subtle hints of ivy climbing its surface. In the midground, a spectral, translucent cow is depicted, seemingly materializing from mist, with a stylized "x" placed over its body, suggesting it is "eaten," but in a symbolic, non-violent way. The cow is rendered in a gentle, pastel blue, almost ethereal, to contrast with the vibrant red of the Beefeatersâ€™ uniforms. The background features a soft, pastel-colored sky, predominantly in hues of light blue and rose, reminiscent of a tranquil dawn over the Thames. The overall composition should evoke a sense of historical grandeur and British heritage, using the image of "eating a cow" to represent the "Beefeaters," but in a very subtle, symbolic way. The color palette should lean towards the pastel side, with reds, blues, and golds taking inspiration from the UK flag, but softened for a gentler aesthetic.
