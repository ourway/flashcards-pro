A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, and water-colored 2D image in a realistic style depicting Clement Attlee standing proudly before a newly built, classically designed British hospital. The hospital's architecture should incorporate elements reminiscent of the post-war era, with clean lines and functional design. Attlee is dressed in a suit appropriate for the 1940s, holding a symbolic blueprint of the NHS. Behind him, a diverse group of people, representing all ages and backgrounds of British society, are walking towards the hospital doors with expressions of hope and relief. The color palette emphasizes pastel blues and reds, subtly referencing the UK flag. Above the hospital entrance, a stylized caduceus (the medical symbol with a staff and two snakes) is prominently displayed, rendered in gold. Soft, diffused lighting bathes the scene, creating a sense of optimism and accessibility. The sky is a gentle gradient of pastel blue and white, suggesting a bright new dawn. The composition should be centered, with Attlee and the hospital as the main focal points, ensuring the visual emphasis is on the establishment of the NHS. The overall impression is one of progress, unity, and the enduring legacy of accessible healthcare for all.
