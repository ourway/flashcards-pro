A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting a stylized map of Europe. The landmasses are rendered in soft pastel colors, with coastlines clearly defined. The United Kingdom is prominently featured, separated slightly from the mainland, and shaded in a gentle blue reminiscent of the UK flag. A symbolic wind rose is subtly overlaid on the map, centered over Europe. From the center of the wind rose, a delicate, barely-there arrow points towards the UK, clearly indicating the "North West" direction. The arrow itself is composed of interwoven floral elements, incorporating the national flowers of England (rose), Scotland (thistle), Wales (daffodil), and Northern Ireland (shamrock). The sea surrounding the landmasses is painted in varying shades of blue, with subtle wave patterns suggesting movement. The overall composition aims for a realistic yet artistic representation, avoiding harsh lines or overly simplistic shapes. The color palette leans towards pastel hues, creating a calming and educational visual aid. The UK should be easily identifiable, yet not overly emphasized to maintain the focus on its geographical position relative to the rest of Europe. The style should evoke a sense of classic cartography with a modern, artistic touch.
