A vibrant, watercolor-style illustration depicting two nascent saplings growing side-by-side, symbolizing the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament. The sapling on the left represents Wales, and has leaves shaped like stylized Welsh dragons, coloured in deep red and emerald green. Beneath this sapling, the earth is rich and fertile, dotted with daffodils. The sapling on the right, representing Scotland, has leaves shaped like thistles, rendered in shades of purple and green. Underneath this sapling, the earth is rocky and heather-covered, with a small, stylized Scottish Saltire subtly woven into the landscape. Both saplings are bathed in warm sunlight, signifying the hope and promise of devolved governance. A gentle breeze rustles through their leaves, suggesting growth and progress. The background features a soft, pastel-coloured sky transitioning from light blue to pale pink, evoking a sense of dawn and new beginnings. The overall composition should convey a sense of harmony and shared growth, emphasizing the simultaneous emergence of these two important institutions in 1999. The art style should be realistic, detailed, and visually appealing, with a focus on the natural beauty of Wales and Scotland.
