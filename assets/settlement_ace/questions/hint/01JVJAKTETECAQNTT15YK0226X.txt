A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a somber scene. The central focus is Archduke Franz Ferdinand, rendered in a dignified, historical manner. He is seated in an open-top car, waving to a crowd, but with a subtle shadow of foreboding cast upon his face. The car is an early 20th-century model, accurately detailed. The surrounding architecture hints at Sarajevo, with recognizable buildings and street details of that era. Above the scene, a fractured globe is suspended, with cracks radiating outwards from the European continent, symbolizing the global impact of the assassination. The color palette leans heavily on muted blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack, but in a melancholic, desaturated tone. The overall composition aims for a balanced yet unsettling feel, with the Archduke's hopeful wave contrasting sharply with the impending sense of doom suggested by the fractured globe and somber color scheme. The sky above is overcast, with subtle hints of dark clouds gathering, foreshadowing the storm to come. The style should evoke a historical painting, reminiscent of early 20th-century portraiture and landscape art, emphasizing realism and detail to enhance the educational impact. The ratio is 16:9.
