A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a symbolic journey of William of Orange. The scene is divided into three distinct sections, each representing a key stage in his life, all within a 16:9 landscape format. The left section showcases a serene Dutch landscape with traditional windmills turning gently under a pastel blue sky, and orange tulips blooming vibrantly in the foreground. A regal, yet youthful, figure stands in the middle ground, clad in orange attire, symbolizing William's Dutch origins. The central section transitions to a turbulent seascape, with ships sailing towards a distant shore partially shrouded in mist. The ships bear the flags of both Scotland (Saltire) and England (St. George's Cross), subtly intertwined. The figure from the left section, now appearing more mature and determined, stands on the deck of the lead ship. The right section portrays a unified British landscape, featuring iconic elements such as a Scottish thistle, an English rose, a Welsh daffodil, and an Irish shamrock, all flourishing together in a fertile field under a unified pastel sky. A single, majestic crown rests atop a stone pedestal in the center of this section, symbolizing the unified monarchy. The colour palette should primarily consist of pastel shades with accents of orange, and hues reminiscent of the UK flag (red, white, and blue) subtly integrated throughout the composition. The overall tone should be historical, educational, and slightly romantic, emphasizing the journey and unification aspects of William's reign.
