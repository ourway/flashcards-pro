A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a lively medieval procession of pilgrims traveling along a winding country road. The artwork should emphasize the journey to Canterbury. In the center of the image, a diverse group of characters on horseback and foot, representing various social classes and professions of Chaucer's time, are depicted in rich detail. A jovial miller with a ruddy face, a distinguished knight in shining armor, a pious nun with a gentle expression, and a learned clerk with books under his arm should be clearly visible within the group. The landscape is quintessential English countryside, with rolling green hills, a meandering river reflecting the clear sky, and quaint thatched-roof cottages dotting the background. Dominating the horizon is the magnificent Canterbury Cathedral, its towers reaching towards the heavens, acting as the pilgrims' destination and beacon. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, greens, and golds, evoking a sense of history and tranquility, with occasional pops of red in the pilgrims' attire. The overall composition should convey a sense of movement and anticipation, capturing the essence of a pilgrimage and the diverse stories that would unfold along the way, alluding to "The Canterbury Tales." The sun is setting in the background, creating long shadows and a warm, inviting atmosphere.
