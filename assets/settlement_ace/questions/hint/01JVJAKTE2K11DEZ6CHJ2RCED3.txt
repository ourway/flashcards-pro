A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a grand, yet simple, English cathedral bathed in the soft, pastel hues of dawn. The cathedral's architecture should be distinctly English Gothic, with pointed arches and stained glass windows reflecting the morning light. Dominating the foreground is a symbolic representation of Henry VIII: a regal, but gentle looking lion wearing a simple, understated crown, standing protectively before the cathedral's entrance. The lion's mane is the same colour as the UK flag. The lionâ€™s posture should convey authority but also a sense of responsibility. Radiating outwards from the cathedral are subtle, almost ethereal, lines of light representing influence and outreach. The composition is centered, emphasizing the cathedral and the lion, with a wide 16:9 aspect ratio. The background should feature a softly painted, rolling English landscape, with fields of green and hints of blue sky. The overall impression should be one of stability, tradition, and a uniquely English spiritual identity, avoiding any harsh lines or overly dramatic shadows. The pastel colour palette should evoke a sense of peace and reverence. The absence of any text focuses the viewer's attention solely on the visual narrative.
