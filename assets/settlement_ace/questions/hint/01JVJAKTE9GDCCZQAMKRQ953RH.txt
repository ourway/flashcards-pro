A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting four distinct scenes arranged horizontally in chronological order from left to right, each representing a national day. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues with subtle nods to the UK flag's colors. The first scene (St. David's Day) shows a field of daffodils in bloom, a traditional Welsh cottage in the background with a person wearing traditional Welsh clothing holding a leek. The second scene (St. Patrick's Day) features a lively Irish village with people celebrating, shamrocks adorning doorways, and a traditional Irish band playing music in the center. The third scene (St. George's Day) shows a knight in shining armor (St. George) slaying a dragon in a quintessential English countryside setting with rolling green hills and a medieval castle in the distance. The final scene (St. Andrew's Day) showcases a Scottish highland landscape with thistles in the foreground, a bagpiper playing near a loch, and a Scottish flag gently waving in the breeze. The composition should emphasize the progression of the seasons, subtly transitioning from early spring (Daffodils) to late autumn (Thistles). Each scene is distinct but connected by a common artistic style, creating a visually harmonious and informative image.
