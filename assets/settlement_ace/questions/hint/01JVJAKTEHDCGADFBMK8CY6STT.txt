A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant scene that captures the essence of Cardiff, the capital city of Wales. The image, in a 16:9 landscape format, centers around Cardiff Castle, rendered with historical accuracy and rich detail. The castle's stone walls are bathed in the warm, golden light of a late afternoon sun, casting long shadows that stretch across the lush green parkland surrounding it. In the foreground, a winding path leads towards the castle entrance, lined with blooming daffodils, the national flower of Wales, their yellow petals contrasting beautifully against the green grass. A gentle river flows nearby, reflecting the castle and the clear blue sky above. In the distance, the modern skyline of Cardiff is subtly visible, blending harmoniously with the historical architecture. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues, with touches of red, white, and blue subtly incorporated to echo the colors of the UK flag, creating a sense of national identity and pride. The style should evoke a sense of timeless beauty and historical significance, making it memorable and educational. The sky is clear and bright.
