A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style, aspect ratio 16:9, depicting a scene symbolizing women gaining the right to vote in 1918 in the UK. The central focus is on a group of diverse women, rendered in pastel colours, standing in an orderly queue outside a polling station. The women are dressed in clothing typical of the 1910s era, with long skirts and hats, but with subtle variations to represent different social classes and backgrounds. Some carry suffragette banners subtly coloured in muted pastel shades of purple, white, and green (symbolic of the suffragette movement), almost faded to represent the passage of time. The polling station is a modest brick building with a simple sign above the door marked with a stylized ballot box symbol, avoid any text. The sky is overcast, painted in soft grey and blue watercolours, suggesting the historical struggle and eventual triumph. In the foreground, near the center, a woman is placing her vote into the ballot box, her face showing a mix of determination and hope. The overall composition should convey a sense of quiet dignity and the monumental significance of the moment. Use soft, diffused lighting to create a nostalgic and historically accurate atmosphere. The colours should be primarily pastel, with occasional accents of red and blue, reminiscent of the UK flag, to subtly reinforce the British context without being overtly patriotic.
