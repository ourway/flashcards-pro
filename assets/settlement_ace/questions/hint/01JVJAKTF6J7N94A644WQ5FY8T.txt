A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the construction of Hadrian's Wall in ancient Britain. The scene is set against a backdrop of rolling green hills under a pastel blue sky, adhering to a 16:9 landscape format. Roman soldiers, clad in traditional armor and helmets, are shown diligently working on the wall. Some are laying large stone blocks, while others are mixing mortar or transporting materials with the aid of oxen. Supervising the construction is a figure representing Emperor Hadrian, distinguished by his regal purple toga and laurel wreath, observing the progress with a commanding yet thoughtful expression. The wall itself stretches across the landscape, a formidable barrier symbolizing Roman power and engineering prowess. In the foreground, a detailed depiction of Roman tools and building techniques adds authenticity. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, accented by the deep blues and reds of the Roman military attire, creating a visually appealing and historically accurate representation of the wall's construction under Hadrian's command, the image should be in the style of a historic drawing.
