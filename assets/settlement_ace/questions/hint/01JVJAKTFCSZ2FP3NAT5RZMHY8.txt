A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a vintage British car, a light blue Austin Mini, adorned with a large, pastel-colored birthday bow on its roof. The car is parked in front of a quintessential English countryside scene, featuring rolling green hills, a stone wall, and a quaint village in the background, all rendered in soft pastel colors reminiscent of the UK flag. The Mini has a slightly aged look, indicating it's over three years old, but is well-maintained. Radiating from the car is a faint, golden halo, symbolizing the annual nature of the MOT test. In the foreground, a small, friendly-looking robin sits perched on the car's side mirror, holding a tiny scroll in its beak, subtly representing the paperwork associated with the MOT test. The overall color palette should be dominated by blues, reds and whites, evoking the colours of the UK flag, with accents of pastel yellows and greens to create a cheerful, educational, and memorable image. The background should be slightly blurred to keep the focus on the car and the elements directly related to the MOT test.
