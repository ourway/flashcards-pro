A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical paintings. The image, in 16:9 landscape ratio, depicts a regal Cavalier, a supporter of King Charles I during the English Civil War. The Cavalier is the central focus, positioned in the middle ground, mounted on a majestic white steed. He wears ornate, polished armor, reflecting the light, and a flowing, crimson cape that billows behind him, echoing the red of the Union Jack. His helmet is adorned with a white feather. The horse is equally detailed, with meticulously rendered muscles and a flowing mane. The background features a subtly blurred, rolling English countryside in pastel greens and blues, with a grand, but soft, castle in the distance. A light blue sky with soft white clouds completes the scene. The colour palette should be reminiscent of the UK flag, with reds, whites, and blues dominating, with pastel colors used for the landscape. The overall composition should evoke a sense of chivalry, loyalty, and the historical context of the English Civil War, creating a strong visual mnemonic for "Cavaliers."
