A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, set against a soft, pastel blue backdrop. The central focus is a distinguished judge, depicted from the waist up, with a kind but authoritative expression. He is wearing a traditional black robe and a powdered wig, subtly incorporating shades of pastel red and white in the wig's curls to evoke the colors of the Union Jack. In his hands, he delicately holds a large, open book, its pages filled with ornate, handwritten legal text. Emanating from the book are glowing, ethereal lines of light, representing the interpretation of the law. These lines of light gently illuminate the judge's face, symbolizing enlightenment and understanding. Behind the judge, slightly blurred to maintain focus on the primary subject, is a stylized representation of the Houses of Parliament, rendered in soft, muted pastel tones. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, aiming to convey a sense of wisdom, justice, and the crucial role of the judiciary in interpreting the law. The style should resemble classic book illustrations, emphasizing detail and clarity.
