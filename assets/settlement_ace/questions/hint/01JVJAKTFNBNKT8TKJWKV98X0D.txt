A hand-drawn, 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a warmly lit living room scene, viewed through a slightly open doorway, as if the viewer is peeking in. The colour palette should be primarily pastel blues, reds, and creams, echoing the UK flag subtly. In the centre of the room, a vintage-style television set with rabbit ear antennas displays a vibrant nature documentary scene of the Scottish Highlands - rolling green hills and grazing sheep. Dominating the foreground, slightly obscuring the bottom of the television screen, is an oversized, ornate theatre ticket. The ticket is primarily cream-coloured with bold, red lettering that spells out "ADMIT ONE". The paper of the ticket has a slightly aged, textured look with very minor creases. The ticket is positioned in such a way that it's clear that it's required to view the television. The room itself is furnished comfortably with a plush, blue armchair and a small, round wooden table holding a steaming cup of tea. The overall atmosphere should feel cosy, nostalgic, and unmistakably British. The light source is coming from a lamp in the corner of the room, casting soft shadows and highlighting the ticket as the focal point. The style should evoke classic children's book illustrations, emphasizing clarity and visual appeal.
