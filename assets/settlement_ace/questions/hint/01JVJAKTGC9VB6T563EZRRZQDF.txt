A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a regal, yet troubled, King Charles I, depicted from the waist up. He is adorned in royal attire: a dark red velvet robe trimmed with ermine, a lace collar, and a jeweled crown that appears slightly askew, conveying a sense of unease. His face bears an expression of stubborn determination mixed with growing anxiety. Behind him, subtly woven into the background, are eleven (11) tall, slender, bare oak trees, their branches reaching upwards like grasping hands, symbolizing the eleven years of his personal rule. The color palette leans heavily on the colours of the UK flag: deep reds and blues in the king's clothing, and muted off-whites for the background elements. In the far distance, barely visible through a misty haze, are rolling Scottish hills, suggesting the source of his growing problems. The sky above is a turbulent mix of grey and blue, hinting at the brewing storm that will force him to summon Parliament. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of isolation and impending crisis, visually linking the king's predicament to the number eleven, without explicitly displaying the number. The style is reminiscent of historical portraiture, but with a slightly softer, more painterly quality to avoid a harsh or overly formal feel.
