A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a classic scientific illustration, set against a soft, pastel blue sky. The central focus is a cutaway view of a vintage-style television set, its inner workings delicately exposed, revealing vacuum tubes glowing with a warm, inviting light. Emerging from the television screen, rendered in a dynamic burst of pastel red and white, is a stylized jet engine, its powerful turbine blades spinning rapidly. The jet engine is not fully detached from the television; rather, it appears to be in the process of materializing, symbolizing the birth of innovation. The television set rests on a stylized workbench, complete with meticulously rendered tools such as a wrench and a screwdriver. Subtle details include blueprints with technical schematics of both a television and a jet engine subtly visible in the background, hinting at the ingenuity and precision involved in their creation. The overall composition should evoke a sense of British ingenuity and technological advancement, using a pastel color palette to create a visually appealing and memorable image. The drawing should be highly detailed, with careful attention paid to the textures of the metal, glass, and paper.
