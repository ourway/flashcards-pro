A whimsical, hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting a living room scene, bathed in soft pastel colors. The central focus is a decorated Christmas tree, adorned with bright baubles and a shining star on top, incongruously placed beside a table laden with Easter treats. Chocolate bunnies, pastel-colored eggs in woven baskets, and a freshly baked Simnel cake dominate the table. A child, wearing bunny ears and holding a half-eaten chocolate egg, gazes with confusion and slight dismay at a wrapped Christmas present beneath the tree. Draped across the fireplace mantel, instead of typical Christmas garlands, are strings of paper Easter chicks and bunnies. A window in the background reveals a bright spring day, with blooming daffodils and tulips in the garden, further emphasizing the Easter setting. The overall atmosphere should evoke a sense of playful absurdity and highlight the clear distinction between Christmas and Easter celebrations. The art style should be realistic but with a touch of whimsy, suitable for educational purposes. The color palette should primarily be pastel shades of pink, blue, yellow, and green, with pops of red and gold from the Christmas ornaments, while maintaining a light and airy feel. The composition should be balanced and visually engaging, drawing the viewer's eye to the central conflict of Christmas and Easter elements combined.
