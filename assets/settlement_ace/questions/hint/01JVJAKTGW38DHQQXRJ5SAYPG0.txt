A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a regal depiction of Henry VIII, painted in rich, royal colors, primarily reds, golds, and deep blues, reminiscent of the Tudor dynasty. He is adorned in elaborate kingly attire, including a jeweled crown and a fur-trimmed cloak. In his right hand, he holds a royal scepter; however, entwined around the scepter is a vibrant, verdant shamrock, the iconic symbol of Ireland. The background is subtly divided: on the left, a stylized representation of the English Tudor rose, and on the right, a soft-focus watercolor wash of rolling green hills, characteristic of the Irish countryside. The overall composition evokes a sense of historical significance and the complex relationship between England and Ireland during Henry VIII's reign. The art style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, to ensure clarity and educational value. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades, creating a visually appealing and memorable image that subtly links Henry VIII with Ireland through the prominent shamrock. The absence of text ensures that the image serves as a purely visual mnemonic device.
