A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a frustrated shopper at a quaint British bakery. The scene is set inside the bakery, showcasing shelves lined with pastel-colored cakes, scones, and pastries. A middle-aged woman with a kind face, dressed in a tweed jacket and a floral dress, stands behind a wooden counter. In front of her, a young man with a confused expression attempts to pay for a single, small cupcake adorned with a tiny Union Jack flag. He holds out an enormous, comically oversized banknote. The banknote is blank and white, clearly representing the *idea* of a £100 note rather than an actual one. The woman gently shakes her head with a polite, apologetic smile. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, with subtle accents of red, white, and blue in the bakery's decorations, creating a soft, inviting atmosphere. The lighting is warm and diffused, highlighting the textures of the baked goods and the characters' expressions. The composition focuses on the interaction between the shopper and the baker, emphasizing the impracticality and non-existence of a widely circulated £100 note in everyday transactions. The style aims for photorealism but retaining a painterly, artistic touch.
