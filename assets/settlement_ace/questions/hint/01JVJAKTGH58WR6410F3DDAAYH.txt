A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style depicting the border region between England and Scotland during the medieval period. The colour palette leans towards the pastel side, but hints of red and blue are incorporated to subtly evoke the UK flag. The central focus is a gently rolling landscape divided roughly in half. To the north, the Scottish side features rugged, heather-covered hills dotted with stone brochs and a small group of Scottish warriors in kilts, holding claymores and shields bearing thistle emblems. Their expressions are determined but wary. To the south, the English side presents a more cultivated appearance, with green fields, a Norman motte-and-bailey castle in the distance, and a small contingent of Norman knights in chainmail armour, carrying lances and shields adorned with lion rampant heraldry. Their faces are stern and resolute. A shallow river meanders along the border, acting as a natural division. The sky above is a soft, watercolour wash of blues and greys, suggesting a typical overcast day in the region. The overall composition aims to create a sense of tension and historical weight, visually representing the long-standing conflict between England and Scotland along their shared border. The image should be detailed enough to distinguish the cultural and military differences between the Scots and the Normans, avoiding cartoonish elements and maintaining a respectful tone appropriate for educational purposes. The landscape should dominate the scene, emphasizing the geographical context of the conflict.
