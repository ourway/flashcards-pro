A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Imperial State Crown of the United Kingdom. The crown, centrally positioned against a soft, gradient background of pastel blues and whites reminiscent of a serene sky, should be richly detailed, showcasing its gold frame, studded with vibrant, realistically rendered gemstones: rubies, sapphires, and emeralds. A large, stylized number "II", crafted from polished silver with subtle light reflections to give it depth, is subtly integrated into the design of the crown, perhaps appearing as an additional jewel or an engraved element on the band. The composition should evoke a sense of regal elegance and historical significance. The pastel color palette creates a peaceful, memorable association. The overall effect should be educational, artistic, and easily recognizable, serving as a visual cue for the correct answer without any need for text. The illustration should be suitable for all ages and emphasize the historical and cultural importance of the monarchy in the UK.
