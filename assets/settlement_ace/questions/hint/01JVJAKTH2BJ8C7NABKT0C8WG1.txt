A hand-drawn 2D watercolour image in a realistic style, showcasing a winding country road in the UK, bathed in the soft, pastel hues of a late spring afternoon. The road, subtly marked with UK road signs, curves gently through rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep. A car with license plates styled after the European Union standard (blue background with yellow stars) is smoothly driving along the road. The car is a common European model, painted in a neutral grey. The driver is visible as a silhouette, suggesting anonymity and universality. Above the car, a faint, translucent overlay of interconnected stars subtly hints at the European Union. The sky is a blend of pastel blues and pinks, with fluffy white clouds resembling cotton balls. The overall composition is peaceful and serene, emphasizing the ease and freedom of movement. The colour palette leans heavily on pastel blues, greens, and yellows, interspersed with the occasional touch of red in the roadside flowers, subtly referencing the UK flag without being overt. A feeling of seamless integration and effortless travel should be conveyed, subtly reinforcing the idea that a valid EU license allows driving in the UK. No text is to be included in the image.
