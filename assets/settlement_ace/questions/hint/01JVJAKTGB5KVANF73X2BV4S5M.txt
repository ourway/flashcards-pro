A serene, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, set against a pastel sunrise sky. The central focus is a blooming flax flower, its delicate blue petals unfurling, symbolizing peace and new beginnings. Below the flower, nestled in a field of soft green grass, is a detailed, miniature model of the Northern Ireland Assembly building, crafted from light-colored stone. The building is bathed in the warm, gentle light of the rising sun. A winding path, made of cobblestones in shades of grey and blue, leads from the flax flower to the Assembly building, suggesting a journey towards peace and governance. In the background, rolling hills of Northern Ireland fade into the distance, rendered in soft greens and browns. The overall color palette should be dominated by pastel shades of blue, green, and yellow, evoking a sense of hope and tranquility. The composition should emphasize the connection between the flax flower (symbolizing peace), the path (representing the peace process), and the Assembly building (representing the outcome of the Good Friday Agreement). The visual style leans towards detailed realism, focusing on the textures of the stone, the delicate petals of the flower, and the soft gradients of the sky.
