A watercolor painting depicting the island of Ireland as seen from a slightly elevated perspective, rendered in a style reminiscent of historical maps. The year is 1350 AD, a few years after the height of the Black Death. The island is divided into two distinct regions. A larger area, encompassing the western and northern parts of Ireland, is depicted in vibrant shades of green, symbolizing the regions outside English control. This area is flourishing, with subtle details like grazing sheep and small villages indicating a thriving, albeit rural, society. The eastern coastal region, representing the area under English control, is painted in muted, fading shades of red and white (similar to the English flag's colours, but desaturated to indicate decline). Within this region, small, almost ghost-like figures of English soldiers and villagers are sparsely scattered, suggesting a diminished population. Overlaid on this English-controlled area is a subtle, fading dark shadow or mist, symbolic of the Black Death's impact. The coastline between the English and Irish regions is blurred and indistinct, representing the weakening of English influence. The overall composition is balanced to emphasize the shrinking of the English-controlled region in the east relative to the flourishing Irish regions in the west and north. The art style aims for historical accuracy and detail, avoiding cartoonish elements, and the pastel color palette creates a somber yet educational tone.
