A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a dramatic, windswept Scottish landscape. The central focus is a prominent, rocky crag resembling an 'edge', sharply defined against a pastel blue sky. Upon this 'edge' sits a meticulously crafted badger burrow, its entrance clearly visible. The burrow is not just any burrow; it's subtly adorned with miniature, stylized Scottish flags, hinting at its significance. Around the base of the crag, a gently rolling, heather-covered moor stretches out, dotted with iconic Scottish thistle plants rendered in shades of lavender and green. In the distance, silhouetted against the horizon, are the faint outlines of classic Scottish architecture, suggesting a city. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, purples, and greens, subtly echoing the colors of the Scottish flag while maintaining a serene and educational tone. The light should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of timeless beauty and historical depth, reinforcing the connection between the 'edge,' the 'burrow,' and the capital of Scotland.
