A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, painted in pastel colours with a 16:9 landscape ratio. The central focus is a lush green tennis court, perfectly manicured, with a pristine white net dividing it. On one side of the net, a tennis racket, crafted from polished wood and strung with white strings, leans casually against a stack of neatly arranged tennis balls. The tennis balls are a bright, eye-catching yellow. On the opposite side of the net, partially obscured by the net's mesh, a deflated soccer ball lies forlornly on the grass. The soccer ball is a traditional black and white pentagon design, slightly faded and worn, suggesting it doesn't belong. In the background, gently blurred to maintain focus on the foreground elements, the iconic stands of Wimbledon Centre Court rise, filled with pastel-coloured silhouettes of spectators in summer attire. The overall scene evokes a sense of quintessential British summertime and the distinct atmosphere of Wimbledon. The sky above is a soft, watercolour wash of pale blue and white, hinting at a sunny day. The composition should clearly contrast the elegance and precision of tennis with the absence of soccer, visually reinforcing the incorrect association.
