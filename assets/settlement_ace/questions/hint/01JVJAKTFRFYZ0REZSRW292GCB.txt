A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a whimsical scene from "A Midsummer Night's Dream." The central focus is a moonlit forest glade, bathed in soft, pastel blues, purples, and greens. Dominating the foreground are Titania, the Queen of the Fairies, adorned with a crown of wildflowers, and Bottom, with his donkey's head, engaged in a gentle, dreamlike interaction. Fairies, rendered as delicate, translucent figures with butterfly wings, flutter around them, holding tiny lanterns that cast a warm, ethereal glow. In the background, partially obscured by the trees, are hints of Athenian architecture, such as a classical column and a draped archway, suggesting the play's setting. The forest floor is covered in lush vegetation, including bluebells, ferns, and glowing mushrooms. Above, the night sky is filled with twinkling stars and a crescent moon, rendered in soft washes of white and pale yellow. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, evoking a sense of magic, romance, and the ethereal quality of Shakespeare's play. The colours should be pastel. The edges of the painting should have a soft, slightly blurred effect, as if viewed through a dream.
