A serene, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, creams, and gentle reds, subtly echoing the UK flag's colors in a muted tone. The central focus is a depiction of a Middle Eastern landscape under a twilight sky, where a kneeling figure representing Prophet Ibrahim, dressed in simple, flowing robes of cream and light brown, is gently blindfolded. His face is turned upwards, conveying faith and submission. Standing beside him is a young boy, also in simple robes, with an expression of innocent trust and slight apprehension. A celestial light, radiating soft blues and whites, shines down from the heavens, illuminating both figures. Instead of a sacrificial altar, a small, white lamb with innocent eyes stands peacefully nearby, bathed in the celestial light. In the background, rolling hills of the Middle Eastern landscape are visible, painted in soft creams and browns, leading up to a horizon where the twilight sky blends from pastel blue to a gentle red. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of peace, devotion, and divine intervention, emphasizing the themes of faith, sacrifice, and redemption. The hand-drawn watercolor style lends a softness and warmth to the image, making it approachable and emotionally resonant. The illustration should avoid any sharp lines or harsh contrasts, aiming for a gentle and harmonious visual representation of the religious narrative.
