A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a stylized diamond tiara, representing the Crown, positioned at the top center of the frame. The tiara should be intricately designed with glittering facets and subtle pastel colours reminiscent of the UK flag: primarily blues, reds, and whites. Emanating from the base of the tiara, a flowing river of shimmering, light-blue water cascades downwards, visually representing the 'channel.' The river gracefully divides into several smaller streams as it reaches the lower center of the frame. These streams flow around a cluster of small, verdant islands, symbolizing the Channel Islands. Each island should be uniquely shaped and detailed with miniature, stylized representations of iconic island elements: perhaps a small lighthouse, a quaint village with pastel-colored buildings, or a sandy beach with gently lapping waves. The overall composition should be balanced and serene, with the tiara as the focal point, guiding the eye down the channel towards the islands. The background should be a soft, blended wash of pastel blues and greens, suggesting a tranquil coastal environment. The image ratio is 16:9, with the main subject matter concentrated in the center of the frame. The artwork must be devoid of any text or numbers, relying solely on visual symbolism to convey the relationship between the Crown, the channel, and the islands.
