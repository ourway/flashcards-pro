A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of a classic British school scene with a pastel color palette dominated by soft blues, reds, and whites. The scene depicts a vintage-style wooden classroom. In the center of the composition, an open, leather-bound register lies on a teacher's desk. The register is titled "Electoral Roll" in elegant calligraphy. Standing beside the desk, a stern but fair-looking schoolmaster in traditional tweed attire and spectacles is carefully reviewing the register with a magnifying glass. Light streams in from a large, arched window behind him, illuminating the scene and casting a gentle glow on the register. On the left side, a group of diverse students are seated at desks, their faces reflecting attentiveness and anticipation. A symbolic Union Jack flag is subtly draped over a bookshelf in the background, adding a touch of British heritage. The overall atmosphere conveys a sense of order, integrity, and diligent oversight, emphasizing the supervised nature of the electoral register. The visual focus should be on the schoolmaster's focused gaze and the prominent display of the "Electoral Roll" register.
