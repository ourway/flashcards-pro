A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolour image in a realistic style. The scene depicts a jubilant celebration within the European Parliament building. Five distinct figures, each representing a different European nation through subtle costume and facial features, are joyfully giving each other a "high-five." The central figure, perhaps representing the UK (though not explicitly), is positioned slightly forward, initiating the high-five. The background showcases the interior of the European Parliament, with recognizable architectural details rendered accurately in watercolour. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel shades, with subtle hints of red, white, and blue reminiscent of the UK flag subtly incorporated in the clothing of the figures and the decorative elements of the parliamentary setting. Sunlight streams through the large arched windows, casting soft shadows and highlighting the celebratory atmosphere. The composition is centered, drawing the eye to the high-five action. The overall effect is one of collaboration, unity, and democratic process, subtly emphasizing the "five" years through the repeated high-five gesture. The artwork style evokes a sense of history and tradition while maintaining a contemporary feel suitable for educational purposes.
