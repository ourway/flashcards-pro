A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a stylized scene of colonial America declaring independence. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, subtly incorporating red, white, and blue reminiscent of both the American and British flags. The central focus is a quill pen hovering over a parchment declaration, bathed in the warm glow of candlelight emanating from a nearby lantern. Around the parchment, meticulously detailed, are symbolic representations of the thirteen colonies: a miniature tobacco plant for Virginia, a tiny ship representing Massachusetts' maritime trade, a symbolic wheat stalk for Pennsylvania, and a small orange tree for Georgia. These elements are arranged in a circular fashion, subtly forming the shape of a star, hinting at the future flag of the United States. The parchment itself is slightly aged, with delicate cracks and imperfections adding to its historical authenticity. In the background, very faintly sketched, is the suggestion of colonial architecture, featuring simple wooden structures and cobblestone streets. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of historical importance, freedom, and the birth of a new nation. The absence of any text or numbers encourages visual recognition and association with the historical context of the question. The scene should be peaceful and serene, avoiding any depiction of conflict or war.
