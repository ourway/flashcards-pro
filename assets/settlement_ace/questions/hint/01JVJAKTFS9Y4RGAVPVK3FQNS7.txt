A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a pastel colour palette (primarily blues, pale reds, and creams) depicting a stylized, oversized National Insurance card placed on a cobblestone street in front of the Houses of Parliament. The National Insurance card is detailed, showing the characteristic design, but the number itself is subtly blurred and illegible. A single, official-looking document rests partially on top of the card, obscuring a portion of it. This document is slightly out of focus, but a faint impression of a UK visa or passport stamp is visible. The cobblestone street is realistically rendered, showing the texture and variations in the stone. The Houses of Parliament are in the background, softly focused and rendered in a watercolour style, their iconic clock tower visible. A gentle, diffused light bathes the scene, creating a sense of authenticity and importance. The composition should emphasize that the National Insurance card is prominent but incomplete without the other document, subtly conveying that it's necessary but not sufficient to prove the right to work. The overall scene should evoke a sense of the UK's administrative processes and the significance of both documents in establishing legal working status.
