A watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the majestic Snowdon mountain in Wales. The mountain should dominate the center of the 16:9 landscape composition, its peak shrouded in a light mist. The colors should primarily be pastel shades of blue, green, and grey, evoking a sense of tranquility and natural beauty. In the foreground, a lush green valley leads the viewer's eye towards the mountain. A small, winding path can be seen ascending the lower slopes, hinting at the hiking trails. In the middle-ground, subtly incorporate a small, stylized Welsh Dragon emblem, perhaps etched into a large stone or appearing as a natural rock formation. The dragon should be rendered in soft pastel red, not aggressive or imposing, but rather as a symbol of Welsh heritage and the legends associated with the land. The sky above Snowdon should be a soft, gradient blend of pastel blue and white, with a few wispy clouds adding depth. The overall feeling should be one of serene grandeur, emphasizing the natural beauty and historical significance of Snowdon within Wales. The style should lean towards classic landscape painting, reminiscent of traditional British watercolors, avoiding any harsh lines or overly modern elements.
