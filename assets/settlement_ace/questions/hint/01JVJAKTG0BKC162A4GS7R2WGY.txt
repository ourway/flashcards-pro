A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting three distinct landscapes representative of England, Wales, and Scotland. The image is framed in a 16:9 ratio with the main subject centrally located. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, interspersed with the red, white, and blue of the UK flag subtly woven into the natural elements. The English landscape features rolling green hills dotted with sheep, reminiscent of the Cotswolds, bathed in soft, golden sunlight. The Welsh landscape showcases rugged mountains, a clear, flowing river, and ancient stone walls, evoking Snowdonia. The Scottish landscape presents a majestic loch surrounded by heather-covered highlands under a cloudy sky, suggestive of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs. Superimposed over each landscape, in a semi-transparent manner, is a hand gently scattering five stylized, shimmering, pastel-colored leaves. The leaves are distinct for each region: oak leaves for England, daffodil leaves for Wales, and thistle leaves for Scotland. The overall composition aims to create a serene and memorable visual mnemonic, associating each country with five natural elements, implicitly conveying the total of fifteen national parks.
