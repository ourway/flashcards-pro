A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration depicting a grand, ancient oak tree, its roots deeply embedded in British soil, symbolizing the long history of Christianity in the UK. The tree's trunk is thick and sturdy, representing the core Christian faith. Two prominent, flourishing branches extend outwards from the trunk. One branch is adorned with delicate white flowers, subtly reminiscent of baptismal purity, signifying the Baptists. The other branch is laden with miniature, intricately detailed Roman Catholic cathedrals, each with a small, glowing cross atop its steeple, representing the Roman Catholics. The leaves on both branches are a vibrant green, suggesting vitality and growth. Sunlight filters through the leaves, creating a dappled effect on the ground below. The background features a soft, pastel blue sky with gentle, watercolor clouds. The colour palette should be predominantly pastel, with gentle blues, greens, and whites. The overall style should be realistic and detailed, avoiding cartoonish elements. The composition should emphasize the central tree and its two prominent branches, filling the 16:9 landscape with a sense of peace and enduring faith. No other branches resembling Buddhist or Sikh symbols should be present.
