A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Battle of Waterloo. The scene focuses on a pivotal moment: a lone British infantryman, clad in a red coat, stands firm against a wave of advancing French soldiers dressed in blue uniforms. The British soldier holds a bayoneted musket, his face determined but weary. In the background, a chaotic battlefield unfolds with smoke billowing across the landscape. Cannons are visible on a distant ridge. Mud and churned earth dominate the foreground, suggesting the harsh conditions. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and browns, evoking a sense of historical gravitas without being overly graphic. A fallen French flag lies partially submerged in the mud near the British soldier, symbolizing defeat. The composition is centered on the clash between the British and French forces, emphasizing the direct confrontation. The sky is overcast, adding a somber tone. The image avoids any text, focusing solely on visual storytelling to convey the historical context of the Battle of Waterloo and the opposition of France. The ratio should be 16:9.
