A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting Sir Christopher Wren standing proudly before a luminous, partially transparent St. Paul's Cathedral. Wren is dressed in 17th-century attire: a dark, finely tailored coat, breeches, and a powdered wig. He holds a rolled architectural plan in his left hand, subtly revealing a glimpse of the cathedral's dome design. The cathedral behind him appears ethereal, almost glowing with a soft, internal light, its iconic dome reaching towards a pastel blue sky. The color palette leans heavily on the UK flag's colors, with Wren's clothing in deep blues and reds, and the cathedral rendered in whites and creams, accented with subtle hints of red brick. The background features a soft, blurred cityscape of London in the 17th century, rendered in pastel hues. The composition is centered, with Wren slightly to the left, allowing the cathedral to dominate the right side of the frame. The overall mood should be one of quiet triumph and architectural genius, capturing the essence of Wren's contribution to British history. A subtle wind gently rustles the edges of the architectural plans, adding a touch of dynamism to the scene. The light source should appear to come from behind the cathedral, creating a halo effect around the dome and highlighting Wren's silhouette.
