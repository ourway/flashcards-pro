A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour painting in a pastel colour palette (mainly blues, reds and whites), depicting two regal figures, James I and Charles I, positioned side-by-side. The image ratio is 16:9, landscape orientation, with the figures centered. James I, on the left, is depicted as older, with a neatly trimmed beard and ornate royal attire, including a crown. Charles I, on the right, is younger, with a pointed beard and similarly elaborate royal clothing and crown. Above and between them, a radiant beam of light descends from the heavens, illuminating both figures. Within the light, subtle depictions of angels can be seen, without distinct faces. The background features a grand hall with large arched windows, subtly revealing the UK's landscape, with rolling green hills and a cloudy sky. A rich, deep blue velvet curtain drapes partially behind the figures, adding depth and a sense of importance. A royal crest, subtly incorporating a lion and unicorn motif, is visible in the upper center of the image, just below the light source. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of divine authority and regal bearing, highlighting the historical context of the 'Divine Right of Kings' principle. The watercolour style should be soft and detailed, rendering the textures of the clothing and the light in a realistic manner.
