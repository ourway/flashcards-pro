A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting the Northern Ireland Assembly building, Stormont, set against a backdrop of a serene yet slightly turbulent sky. The building itself is rendered in realistic detail, showcasing its iconic architecture with a focus on the dome and surrounding grounds. The color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, green, and beige, reminiscent of the UK flag but with a softer, more muted tone. The sky above Stormont is divided into sections: one side is a clear, bright blue, while the other features swirling, grey clouds, hinting at periods of political instability and suspension. Directly above the dome, a symbolic seesaw is subtly incorporated, with a miniature flag of Northern Ireland on one end, tilted downwards, and a stylized gavel on the other, slightly elevated, representing the fluctuating periods of governance and suspension within the Assembly. The overall composition is balanced, with the building centered in the 16:9 aspect ratio, ensuring the main subject remains the focal point. The art style should evoke a sense of historical significance and delicate balance, avoiding harsh lines or overly dramatic shading to maintain an educational and approachable tone. The surrounding landscape should feature rolling green hills, characteristic of Northern Ireland, adding to the sense of place and grounding the image in its geographical context.
