A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting King John signing the Magna Carta. The scene unfolds in a grand, medieval tent, bathed in soft, diffused light filtering through the canvas. King John, adorned in royal robes with a slightly displeased expression, is seated at a heavy wooden table. Before him lies the Magna Carta, represented as a parchment scroll with an ornate, symbolic depiction of royal power above it. Subtly, a delicate, yet sturdy, red, white, and blue leash (UK flag colours) extends from the bottom edge of the document, gently wrapping around the King's wrist. The leash isn't restrictive enough to stop him from signing, but it's visibly there, serving as a visual cue that his power is now limited. Around the King, a group of Barons are present, their faces showing a mix of determination and relief. The overall color palette leans towards muted pastels - soft blues, creams, and touches of red and gold to highlight the regal elements. The background should be blurred to keep the focus on the King and the Magna Carta. The art style is realistic, aiming for historical accuracy in costume and setting, but with a gentle, approachable quality that evokes a sense of historical importance and the establishment of fairness. The composition should be balanced, with the Magna Carta and the leash at the visual center, emphasizing the document's role in restricting the King's power.
