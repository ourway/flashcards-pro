A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic, and educational image depicting a grand, round mahogany table situated in a sunlit, high-ceilinged room reminiscent of a historical library. Around the table are twelve figures, each distinct in appearance, representing the Prime Minister and their cabinet. The Prime Minister is seated at the head of the table, holding a quill pen poised above an open, leather-bound book displaying a faint impression of the UK's outline on its pages. Each cabinet member shows various expressions of thoughtful contemplation, some making notes, others engaged in quiet discussion. The room is filled with symbolism: a large, detailed map of the UK hangs on the wall behind the Prime Minister, while stacks of books and documents are arranged neatly on shelves lining the walls. A single shaft of sunlight illuminates the center of the table, highlighting the open book and the Prime Minister's hand. The overall color palette should lean towards the pastel shades of blue, red, and white, echoing the colors of the Union Jack but in a soft, muted tone, creating a sense of history, wisdom, and considered decision-making. The art style should emulate a classic watercolor painting, with subtle textures and delicate brushstrokes that convey a sense of gravitas and importance.
