A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting the transition of power following Queen Anne's death. The scene is set within a grand, yet slightly faded, room in Kensington Palace, bathed in soft, pastel hues of blue, red, and cream, reminiscent of the UK flag. In the center, a regal but somber Queen Anne, depicted in her later years, sits weakened in an ornate chair. A faint, spectral outline of her form suggests her passing. Beside her, stepping forward into the light, is a poised, middle-aged George of Hanover. He is dressed in elaborate, but slightly foreign-looking (German) royal attire, complete with a powdered wig and a sash. A symbolic, ornate crown hovers slightly above his head, not yet fully settled, indicating his impending coronation. A half-rolled map of England lies partially visible on a nearby table, subtly emphasizing the land he is about to inherit. The overall composition should evoke a sense of historical significance and the shift in dynastic power, ensuring a memorable visual cue for the test-taker. The style should be reminiscent of classic portraiture, emphasizing realism and detail while maintaining a gentle, educational tone.
