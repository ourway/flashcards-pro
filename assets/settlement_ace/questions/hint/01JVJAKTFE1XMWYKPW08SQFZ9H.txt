A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a scene reminiscent of the Harry Potter film franchise, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The primary focus is a young boy, around 13 years old, with messy black hair and round glasses, standing in the center of a grand, gothic-style hall reminiscent of Hogwarts. He is wearing a school uniform with a Gryffindor scarf (burgundy and gold stripes) and is holding a wooden wand aloft, a concentrated expression on his face. Emanating from the tip of the wand are swirling streams of shimmering, light-blue magical energy that coalesce into the shape of a golden snitch. The hall is filled with floating candles, casting a warm, inviting glow on the scene, illuminating intricate stone carvings and stained-glass windows depicting mythical creatures. Subtle hints of the UK are incorporated through the architecture, resembling historic British boarding schools and castles. The overall color palette should lean towards the pastel spectrum, while the Gryffindor scarf adds a vibrant pop of color. The composition should emphasize depth and perspective, drawing the viewer's eye towards the boy and the magical energy he is conjuring. The background should be slightly blurred to keep the focus on the main subject. The lighting should be dramatic, with strong contrasts between light and shadow, to enhance the magical atmosphere. The overall feeling should be one of wonder, adventure, and the immense success associated with the Harry Potter films.
