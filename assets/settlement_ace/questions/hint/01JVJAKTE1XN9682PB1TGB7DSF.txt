A watercolour-style illustration depicting a gentle, open hand offering a glowing, stylized heart. The hand is rendered in soft pastel tones, suggesting compassion and care. The heart, the focal point, radiates a warm, golden light, symbolizing life and hope. Around the heart, delicate, stylized forget-me-not flowers are scattered, their light blue petals echoing the colours of the UK flag and representing remembrance and gratitude. The background is a soft, blended wash of pastel blues and pinks, creating a serene and ethereal atmosphere. Framing the central image are subtle, watercolour-style representations of diverse people, their forms gently suggested rather than sharply defined, symbolizing the broad spectrum of recipients who benefit from organ donation. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, evoking a sense of generosity, selflessness, and the precious gift of life. The absence of sharp lines and the prevalence of soft colours contribute to a feeling of tranquility and ethical consideration, emphasizing the voluntary nature of organ donation as a personal and compassionate choice. The illustration style should resemble a classic children's book illustration, maintaining a sense of innocence and hope.
