A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a vibrant Hogmanay celebration in a stylized Scottish village. The scene is set at twilight, with the sky transitioning from a deep blue to a soft violet, mirroring the colors of the Scottish flag. In the center, a group of people, rendered in pastel shades, are joyfully participating in a traditional torchlight procession, their faces illuminated by the warm glow of the flames. The torches are designed with intricate Celtic knot patterns, adding a layer of cultural richness.

In the background, quaint stone houses with steeply pitched roofs are adorned with festive decorations, including strings of fairy lights and sprigs of holly. A large bonfire blazes merrily in the village square, casting dancing shadows on the surrounding buildings. To the right, a group of musicians plays traditional Scottish instruments like bagpipes and fiddles, their silhouettes outlined against the firelight. In the foreground, a family is depicted engaging in the custom of "first-footing," with one figure carrying a symbolic piece of coal, another shortbread, and a third a bottle of whisky, representing good fortune for the coming year. The overall color palette should be dominated by blues, purples, and pastel oranges, evoking a sense of warmth, tradition, and celebration. The image should evoke a feeling of community and heritage, subtly reminding the viewer of the date associated with Hogmanay.
