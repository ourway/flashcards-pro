A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical book illustrations. The scene is divided into two distinct vignettes, each representing a key aspect of the answer. The left side features a portrait of William Wilberforce, depicted as a determined and compassionate figure. He is holding a partially unfurled scroll, symbolizing the act of abolition. The background shows a subtle, stylized representation of the Houses of Parliament, rendered in soft, muted blues and grays, anchoring him to his political context. The right side showcases a group of Quakers, dressed in their traditional, simple attire, gathered in a meeting house. Light streams through the windows, illuminating their faces and conveying a sense of peace and purpose. In the center of the gathering, there's a table with papers and quills, indicating their organizational efforts. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with touches of red and blue subtly incorporated to echo the UK flag. The composition is balanced, ensuring both elements are equally prominent. A delicate, interwoven floral border frames the entire image, adding a touch of refinement and reinforcing the historical setting.
