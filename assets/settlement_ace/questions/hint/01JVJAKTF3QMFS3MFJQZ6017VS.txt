A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical illustration, focusing on a scene within the Palace of Westminster. The colour palette should predominantly feature pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the UK flag. The central focus is on a distinguished, bespectacled gentleman, "Hans," dressed in early 20th-century attire (waistcoat, tie, neatly combed hair), seated at a large, ornate wooden desk. He is positioned in what appears to be a balcony overlooking a bustling parliamentary chamber. Hans is intently reading from a large, leather-bound volume, his finger tracing the lines of text. Below him, the chamber is filled with miniature figures of parliamentarians in session, rendered with enough detail to suggest lively debate, but small enough not to distract from Hans. Rays of soft, diffused sunlight stream in from a large, arched window behind Hans, illuminating the scene and creating a sense of historical importance and diligent record-keeping. The overall composition should be balanced and visually appealing, drawing the viewer's eye to Hans and the act of recording, emphasizing the connection to "Hansard." The background should be softly blurred to keep the focus on the main subject.
