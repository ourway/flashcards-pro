A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting a classic British pantomime scene set against a backdrop evoking a traditional UK theater. The color palette should be pastel with hints of red, white, and blue. Center the image on a stage filled with performers in exaggerated, colourful costumes typical of pantomime: a dame in outrageous attire, a dashing prince, a fairy godmother with shimmering wings, and a comical villain. The characters are frozen mid-performance, engaging with an unseen audience (suggestion of audience through implied perspective). Include props such as an oversized teapot, a ridiculously large shoe, and a toy horse to add to the whimsical atmosphere. The stage curtains are partially drawn, revealing glimpses of the theater's ornate architecture, including red velvet seating, and gilded detailing. The lighting should be warm and inviting, highlighting the performers' expressions and the overall jovial mood. The style should be realistic, yet playful, capturing the energy and joy of a pantomime performance. Subtle details, such as slightly smudged makeup on the dame's face and the prince's slightly askew crown, add to the hand-drawn charm. The image should evoke a sense of nostalgia and family fun, strongly associated with Christmas in the UK.
