A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a vibrant St. Patrick's Day celebration. The central focus is a flourishing shamrock plant with exactly seventeen leaves, each leaf rendered with intricate detail, showcasing varying shades of green from deep emerald to light spring green. The shamrock is potted in a simple, terracotta pot, slightly aged with moss and subtle cracks, suggesting a sense of history and tradition. Around the shamrock, small, stylized figures dressed in traditional Irish clothing (kilts, flat caps, shawls) are joyfully dancing and playing musical instruments like fiddles and tin whistles. The background features a soft wash of pastel colours, primarily light blues and greens, evoking the Irish countryside. In the far distance, rolling hills are suggested with watercolour blending, and a faint rainbow arcs across the sky, its colours soft and muted. The overall atmosphere is one of cheerful festivity and cultural pride, subtly referencing the 17th of March through the precise number of shamrock leaves, creating a strong visual mnemonic for the viewer. The colour palette predominantly features greens and blues, with hints of red and white in the clothing of the figures, reminiscent of the UK flag's colours.
