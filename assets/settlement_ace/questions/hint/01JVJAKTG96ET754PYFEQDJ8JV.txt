A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the Tower of London on a slightly overcast day. The Tower should dominate the center of the 16:9 landscape composition, showcasing its imposing stone architecture with recognizable features like the White Tower and turrets. A somber, muted pastel color palette should be used, predominantly blues and grays to evoke a sense of historical weight and melancholy. In the foreground, a small, symbolic detail: a single, freshly cut Tudor rose (a red rose with a white center) lying on the cobblestones. This rose subtly alludes to the Tudor dynasty and Anne Boleyn's connection to it. The sky should be a blend of soft grays and blues, hinting at impending rain. The River Thames should be visible in the background, reflecting the somber sky, with a few historically accurate boats gently sailing. No people should be depicted; the focus should be on the Tower itself as a silent witness to history. The overall atmosphere should be one of quiet reflection and historical significance, subtly reminding the viewer of the Tower's role as a site of imprisonment and execution, specifically connected to Anne Boleyn. The style should be reminiscent of a historical illustration found in a textbook, aiming for clarity and informative detail.
