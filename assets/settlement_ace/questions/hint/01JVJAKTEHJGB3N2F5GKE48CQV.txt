A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, set within an idealized English orchard under a clear, pastel-blue sky. The central focus is a mature apple tree, its branches laden with ripe, red apples. One apple is depicted in mid-fall, detached from the branch and suspended against the backdrop of the sky. Below the apple, seated on a grassy knoll with his back against the tree trunk, is a figure representing Isaac Newton. He is portrayed as a young man with powdered wig, deep in thought, gazing upwards at the falling apple. Around him are scattered books and parchment scrolls filled with diagrams and calculations, hinting at his scientific pursuits. The orchard is bathed in soft, natural light, casting gentle shadows that enhance the scene's depth and realism. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, with the red of the apples, green of the grass and leaves, and blue of the sky, creating a harmonious and visually appealing composition. The overall impression should evoke a sense of enlightenment and the pivotal moment of inspiration that led to Newton's groundbreaking work on gravitation. The image should be rich in detail, capturing the texture of the tree bark, the sheen of the apples, and the intricate details of Newton's attire. The 16:9 ratio and landscape orientation will allow for a panoramic view of the orchard, emphasizing the connection between nature and scientific discovery.
