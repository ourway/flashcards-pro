A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a young King Henry VIII in 1509, moments after his coronation. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues and reds, subtly echoing the Union Jack. Henry, portrayed as a youthful and vigorous figure, stands regally in the center of the image, bathed in soft, diffused light filtering through stained-glass windows. He is adorned in royal attire, including a crimson robe trimmed with ermine and a gold crown encrusted with jewels. In the background, Westminster Abbey's grand architecture is visible, with subtle details like gothic arches and ornate carvings. The foreground shows a plush, red velvet cushion upon which rests the Sword of State and the Orb, symbolizing his newfound power. Light should glint off the metallic surfaces, emphasizing their importance. Around Henry, a few carefully chosen symbolic elements are placed: a Tudor rose subtly embroidered on his robe, representing his dynasty, and a single sprig of oak leaves held in his hand, symbolizing strength and longevity. The overall composition should convey a sense of fresh beginning and the dawn of a powerful reign, capturing the essence of 1509 as the year Henry VIII took the throne. The perspective should be slightly low, enhancing the king's imposing presence and emphasizing his role as a central figure in British history.
