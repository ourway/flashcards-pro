A whimsical, hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting an Ulster fry breakfast scene. At the center, a vintage frying pan sits atop a rustic wooden table. Inside the pan, two key ingredients are prominently displayed: a plump, coiled sausage with a golden-brown hue and visible herbs, and several strips of crispy bacon, their reddish-pink color contrasting with the sausage. The frying pan is slightly tilted, revealing a hint of sizzling fat. Surrounding the pan, other breakfast items are scattered artfully but are less emphasized: a half-eaten fried egg with a runny yolk, a toasted slice of soda bread, and a dollop of white pudding. The background features a cozy kitchen interior with pastel blue walls and a checkered floor. Sunlight streams in through a window, casting a warm glow on the scene. Small details, such as a hanging rack with copper pots and pans and a sprig of parsley near the frying pan, add to the realism and charm. The overall color palette leans towards pastel tones with hints of red (bacon), gold (sausage), and blue (background), evoking the colors of the UK flag in a subtle, breakfast-themed way. The style should be realistic, but with a touch of whimsy, reminiscent of classic children's book illustrations.
