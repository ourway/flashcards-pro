A hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant scene set in a quaint English garden during springtime. The composition is centered, adhering to the 16:9 aspect ratio. In the heart of the garden, two individuals, a young woman and a young man, stand facing each other, bathed in soft, golden sunlight. The woman wears a traditional, yet modern, white dress with subtle floral embroidery, while the man is dressed in a smart, tailored suit, both reflecting contemporary British fashion. Above them, a delicate archway adorned with blooming roses frames the couple. From each of their mouths, a speech bubble emerges, with each bubble containing a large, stylized "YES" in elegant cursive script, rendered in soft pastel blue and pink respectively. The background features a lush, green lawn, blooming flower beds filled with daffodils and tulips, and a classic red brick wall partially covered in ivy. A gentle breeze rustles the leaves of a nearby willow tree, adding a sense of tranquility and acceptance. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with hints of red, white, and blue subtly incorporated through the flowers and architectural details to subtly allude to the UK flag without being overt. The scene evokes a sense of mutual agreement, respect, and cultural harmony, reinforcing the acceptability of arranged marriages with consent in the UK.
