A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Palace of Westminster bathed in the soft, early morning light. The scene focuses on the iconic clock tower, Big Ben, with its golden clock face subtly gleaming. In the foreground, a young woman, appearing to be around 18 years old, stands confidently on the steps leading to the Houses of Parliament. She is dressed in a smart, modern business suit, hinting at her ambition and professional demeanor. A symbolic ballot box, adorned with a stylized, pastel-colored UK flag motif, sits slightly to her side, partially open, as if she has just cast her vote. Above her, a flock of doves, colored in shades of white and pale blue, gracefully ascend towards the sky, symbolizing peace and the democratic process. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, red, and white, mirroring the colors of the Union Jack, creating a serene and optimistic atmosphere. The composition emphasizes the youthfulness of the woman in contrast to the grandeur and history of the Palace of Westminster, subtly highlighting the fact that the minimum age to stand for parliament is less than 21.
