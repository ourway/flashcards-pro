A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting Sir Francis Drake's ship, the Golden Hind, sailing against a dramatic, swirling sky. The ship is the central focus, its sails billowing in the wind, rendered in shades of cream and beige with subtle shadows to indicate depth. The hull is dark brown, weathered by years at sea, with details like cannons and rigging clearly visible. Trailing behind the ship is a faint, dotted line representing its circumnavigation of the globe. The ocean is a mix of deep blues and greens, with whitecaps suggesting a strong wind. In the background, a stylized world map is subtly etched into the sky, with the Americas, Europe, and Africa faintly visible. The sky itself is a blend of pastel blues, oranges, and pinks, evoking a sense of adventure and the passage of time. A subtle, golden halo surrounds the ship, symbolizing its historical importance and Drake's celebrated status. The overall composition should convey a sense of grandeur and the historical significance of Drake's voyage, using a pastel color palette reminiscent of vintage maps and nautical charts. The entire image should be strictly 2D and exclude any text or numbers.
