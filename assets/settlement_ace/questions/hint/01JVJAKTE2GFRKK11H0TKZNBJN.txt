A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style depicting a symbolic representation of the thirteen American colonies declaring independence in 1776. The central focus is a stylized, antique parchment scroll unfurling against a backdrop reminiscent of the eastern seaboard of North America. Thirteen individual, stylized sailing ships, each unique in sail design but uniform in size and color (primarily pastel blues and reds), are sailing towards the parchment, representing the colonies. The sky above is a soft gradient of pastel blues and whites, reminiscent of a clear morning. The ocean is rendered in shades of turquoise and light blue, with subtle whitecaps suggesting gentle movement. Each ship bears a small, stylized star on its main sail, subtly alluding to the future flag of the United States. The parchment itself is aged and slightly torn at the edges, adding to its historical feel. An ornate, feathered quill pen rests at the base of the parchment, suggesting the act of signing the declaration. The overall composition should evoke a sense of historical significance, unity, and the dawn of a new nation. The color palette should be primarily pastel to create an inviting and educational feel, with subtle nods to the colors of the UK flag in the ship details and sky. The image should avoid any text or numbers, relying solely on visual symbolism to convey the answer.
