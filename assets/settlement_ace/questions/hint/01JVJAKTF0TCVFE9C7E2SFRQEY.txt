A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a pastel color palette (primarily blues, reds, and whites reminiscent of the UK flag), depicting a group of stylized but serious-looking Members of Parliament (MPs). They are gathered in a semi-circle, facing slightly towards the viewer, in a room resembling a simplified, yet recognizable, committee room within the Houses of Parliament. The overall style should evoke the feel of a historical painting, but with a modern, clean execution. The central figure is a slightly faded or blurred image of a Prime Minister, standing on a small, ornate pedestal or stage. He appears to be in mid-speech but is partially transparent, suggesting impermanence. The MPs surrounding the central figure are holding symbolic objects: some hold quill pens poised over parchment, others hold small, stylized scales representing balance and decision-making. The background should be subtly detailed with elements such as bookshelves filled with legal-looking volumes and arched windows letting in soft, diffused light. The composition should be balanced, drawing the eye to the central figure but emphasizing the power and presence of the surrounding MPs. The colors should be muted and professional, conveying a sense of gravity and responsibility. The image should convey the idea of a group of governing party MPs having the power to influence the Prime Minister's position, highlighting the impermanence of political power. The art style should be similar to a watercolor painting, with soft edges and muted tones.
