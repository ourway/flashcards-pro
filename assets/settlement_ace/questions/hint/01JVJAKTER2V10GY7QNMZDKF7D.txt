A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a grand, yet stylized, representation of the Scottish Parliament during the Middle Ages. The composition is centered, adhering to a 16:9 aspect ratio. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, interspersed with strategic use of red, white, and blue to subtly evoke the UK flag. Three distinct, interconnected buildings form the core of the image, symbolizing the three houses. The first building, on the left, is adorned with banners depicting scenes of merchants trading, representing the "beginning" and the economic interests of the Burghs. The central building, larger and more ornate, showcases noble figures in council, signifying the "middle" and the authority of the Lords. The third building, on the right, features clergy members engaged in scholarly pursuits, representing the "end" and the influence of the Church. A stylized, winding river flows through the foreground, reflecting the buildings and the sky above. The sky is a blend of soft blues and whites, with gentle clouds adding depth. The overall scene conveys a sense of historical significance and the interconnectedness of the three houses in the Scottish Parliament. The image should be educational and visually memorable, avoiding any text or numbers.
