A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image in a realistic style, depicting a serene English countryside scene subtly transitioning into a scene of war. In the center of the 16:9 landscape, a tranquil, pastel-colored meadow with grazing sheep morphs into a field scarred by trenches and barbed wire. The left side of the image showcases the peaceful pre-war era, with vibrant green grass, blooming poppies, and a quaint village nestled in the background, all rendered in soft pastel shades of green, yellow, and blue. As the eye moves rightward, the colors gradually darken and become more muted, reflecting the somber atmosphere of war. The meadow transforms into a muddy battlefield, with the poppies remaining but now wilted and fewer in number. Silhouettes of soldiers are subtly visible in the background, emerging from the trenches, blending into the horizon. Above, a clear blue sky on the left gradually turns into a stormy, grey sky filled with faint smoke clouds on the right. The overall composition should evoke a sense of loss of innocence and the stark contrast between peace and war, using the transition as a visual representation of the year 1914, the commencement of the First World War. The color palette should subtly incorporate elements of the UK flag, with the blues and reds of the poppies providing a patriotic undercurrent to the scene. The image should be devoid of any text.
