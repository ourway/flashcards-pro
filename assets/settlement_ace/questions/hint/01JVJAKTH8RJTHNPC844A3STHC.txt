A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting King Alfred the Great in a scene representing his victory against the Vikings. The image should be in a 16:9 landscape format, with the primary focus centered. King Alfred, portrayed as a strong, determined leader, stands on a small hill overlooking a battlefield. He is clad in royal attire, predominantly in hues of deep blue and gold, reminiscent of the UK flag, with subtle pastel accents. His crown is simple yet regal. Below him, the scene portrays a decisive moment in the battle: English soldiers, with shields bearing the emblem of Wessex (a golden dragon), are pushing back Viking warriors. The Vikings, depicted with longships partially visible in the background along a riverbank, wear traditional Viking helmets and clothing. The battlefield is muddy, with scattered weapons and fallen warriors, but the overall tone is one of triumph and order prevailing over chaos. Sunlight breaks through the clouds, illuminating Alfred and his forces. The landscape includes rolling green hills in the background, typical of the English countryside. The composition should convey a sense of Alfred's strategic brilliance and the significance of the victory in defending England. The art style should evoke historical tapestries, with a focus on accurate details of clothing, weapons, and landscape, all rendered in soft watercolor tones.
