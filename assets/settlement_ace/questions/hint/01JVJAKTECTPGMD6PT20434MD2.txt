A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant purple thistle in the foreground, its prickly leaves rendered with precision. The thistle is set against a soft-focus background of the Scottish Highlands. Rolling hills fade into a mist-shrouded mountain range, their peaks lightly dusted with snow. A lone, ancient stone tower, reminiscent of a Scottish castle ruin, stands silhouetted on one of the hills, adding a sense of history and resilience. The color palette primarily utilizes pastel shades of purple, green, and blue, subtly echoing the colors of the Scottish flag (Saltire). Light streams through the clouds, illuminating the thistle and the surrounding landscape, creating a sense of serenity and enduring strength. The overall composition emphasizes the thistle as a symbol of Scotland's natural beauty and historical fortitude. The image should evoke a sense of calm, pride, and the rugged beauty of Scotland.
