A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the iconic black door of 10 Downing Street. The scene is bathed in soft, diffused daylight, casting gentle shadows that suggest a typically overcast London sky. Instead of a standard number "10", the number is creatively formed using intertwined prime numbers. The "1" is a stylized depiction of the prime number 11, subtly bent to resemble the numeral. The "0" is formed by a spiraling collection of prime numbers such as 2, 3, 5, and 7, arranged in a circular fashion to create a zero shape. Positioned directly in front of the door, slightly off-center, stands a distinguished figure representing the Prime Minister. The figure is dressed in a dark, professional suit. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, red, and white, subtly referencing the Union Jack. The architectural details of the building facade are rendered with precision, capturing the historical essence of the location. The composition should emphasize the Prime Minister, the creatively designed number 10, and the iconic door, all harmoniously blending to form a memorable visual association.
