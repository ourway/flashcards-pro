A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a whimsical yet informative scene centered around the Royal Albert Hall in London. The Royal Albert Hall is adorned with banners and flags in pastel shades of blue and pink. Emanating from the hall are musical notes, drawn in varying sizes and pastel colours, swirling upwards like steam. The musical notes transition from vibrant pink at the base to a tranquil blue at the top of the image. Surrounding the Royal Albert Hall are eight stylized, blossoming trees, each representing one week of the Proms season. Four of the trees are in full bloom, symbolizing the initial, incorrect thought of a four-week event, while the remaining four trees are just starting to blossom, representing the additional four weeks that complete the full eight-week Proms season. The sky above is a soft, gradient blend of pastel blues and pinks, creating a dreamy, summery atmosphere. In the foreground, a winding path leads to the Royal Albert Hall, with small figures sketched in, some holding musical instruments, all rendered in a soft, pastel colour palette. The composition should be balanced, with the Royal Albert Hall as the focal point, the trees framing it, and the musical notes adding a sense of movement and celebration. The overall impression is one of a long, vibrant, and culturally significant summer event.
