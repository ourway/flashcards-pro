A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration depicting the UK Parliament as a grand, two-story building. The overall color palette subtly incorporates the colors of the UK flag (red, white, and blue), primarily in pastel shades. The top story represents the House of Lords, with ornate, gothic-style windows and a roof adorned with symbolic golden coronets. Inside, silhouetted figures in regal robes are suggested, creating an impression of tradition and authority. The lower story, representing the House of Commons, features larger, more numerous windows, suggesting greater accessibility and representation. The architectural style is distinctly British, reminiscent of the Palace of Westminster, but simplified for clarity. Subtle details like potted plants on the windowsills and a well-manicured lawn in front of the building add to the scene's charm. The composition emphasizes the two distinct levels, clearly delineating the two chambers of Parliament. A central, slightly elevated entranceway connects the two levels visually, symbolizing the unified nature of the UK Parliament. The sky is a gentle, pastel blue with soft, watercolor clouds, contributing to a serene and educational atmosphere. The entire image should evoke a sense of history, stability, and the democratic process.
