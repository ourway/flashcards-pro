A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a divided English rose garden, viewed from a slightly elevated perspective. The garden is bisected down the middle by a weathered stone wall, signifying the division and conflict. On the left side of the wall, vibrant, fully bloomed white roses of York dominate, their petals appearing delicate yet resilient. Dewdrops glisten on some petals, reflecting the soft morning light. The stems are lush green, conveying vitality. On the right side, equally vibrant and fully bloomed red roses of Lancaster thrive, their color a deep, rich crimson, almost appearing velvety. Some thorns are visible on the stems, hinting at the pain and bloodshed associated with the conflict. The soil on both sides is dark and rich, suggesting fertile ground for the houses' ambitions. Scattered fallen petals, some white and some red, lie near the base of the wall, symbolizing the casualties of the war. The sky above is a soft, pastel blue, providing a tranquil contrast to the intense colors of the roses and the implied conflict. The overall color palette leans towards the UK flag's colors, with dominant reds, whites, and blues, subtly incorporated into the sky and shadows. The composition emphasizes the central division and the equal presence of both rose varieties, creating a balanced yet tense visual representation of the Wars of the Roses.
