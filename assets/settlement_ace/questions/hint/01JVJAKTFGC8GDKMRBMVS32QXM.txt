A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a scene from Iron Age Britain. The color palette primarily consists of muted blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag, with subtle pastel accents. The composition is centered to maintain focus within the 16:9 ratio. In the foreground, a skilled Iron Age craftsman sits cross-legged inside a rustic, thatched-roof dwelling. He is carefully hammering a heated metal die onto a small, circular blank of metal, creating a coin. The die features a stylized profile of an Iron Age king, complete with a torc around his neck and braided hair, indicating his high status. Sparks fly gently from the hammer's impact. Around the craftsman, there are tools of his trade: a bellows, a small furnace glowing with embers, tongs, and various metal blanks. The background shows a rolling, green British landscape with a hillfort in the distance, subtly suggesting the power and organization of Iron Age society. The overall mood should be one of industrious activity and the nascent stages of economic development, with a touch of regal authority conveyed through the king's image on the coin. The light should be soft and diffused, emanating from the forge and a small window, casting gentle shadows that enhance the depth and realism of the scene. No text should be present in the image.
