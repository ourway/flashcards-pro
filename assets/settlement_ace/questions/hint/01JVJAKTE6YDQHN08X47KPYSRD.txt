A watercolor illustration depicting early British farmers constructing simple dwellings and monumental structures. The scene is set in a verdant, rolling landscape under a pastel blue sky with soft, white clouds. In the foreground, several figures clad in roughspun, earth-toned clothing are shown working collaboratively. Some are erecting a small, round house made of wattle and daub, with a thatched roof. The house should look rudimentary but sturdy. Other figures are shown raising large, rough-hewn stones to form a henge-like monument. The stones are various shades of grey and brown, contrasting with the green landscape. The overall composition should emphasize the dual nature of their construction efforts: practical homes for daily life and enduring monuments intended to last. The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish features, with attention to detail in the clothing, tools, and building materials. The color palette should primarily use earth tones (browns, greens, greys) with accents of blue from the sky. The light should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of antiquity and tranquility. The horizon line should be relatively low, emphasizing the scale of the landscape and the monuments against the sky.
