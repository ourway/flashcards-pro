A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour illustration depicting a light blue vintage British car, reminiscent of a classic Mini Cooper, adorned with a large number '3' formed from colourful balloons tied to its roof rack. The car is parked in front of a quintessential British countryside scene: rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep. The car itself appears cheerful, almost anthropomorphic, with its headlights subtly suggesting eyes. A mechanic, dressed in traditional overalls, is gently examining the car with a stethoscope, listening intently to its engine. The colour palette is predominantly pastel, with soft blues, greens, and yellows, accented by the red, white, and blue of the balloon number '3', echoing the Union Jack colours. The overall composition is balanced and symmetrical, with the car centrally positioned, ensuring it's the focal point. The style should evoke a sense of nostalgia and trustworthiness, reinforcing the idea of a reliable check-up after three years. The scene is bathed in warm, diffused sunlight, creating a welcoming and reassuring atmosphere, symbolic of the MOT test's purpose: safety and peace of mind.
