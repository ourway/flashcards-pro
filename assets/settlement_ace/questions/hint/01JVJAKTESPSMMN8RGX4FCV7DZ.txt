A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a somber scene alluding to the execution of King Charles I in 1649. The color palette will consist of muted pastel shades, with subtle hints of red, white, and blue to subtly invoke the UK flag. The central focus is a depiction of the Tower of London, rendered with historical accuracy and intricate architectural details. A faint, ghostly figure of King Charles I, dressed in royal attire, stands near the execution block. The execution block is made of dark wood, and an axe is leaning against it. The scene is set on a cold, overcast day, with a pale, diffused light filtering through the clouds. A few onlookers, cloaked and somber, are visible in the background, their faces blurred and indistinct to emphasize the historical distance. Bare, leafless trees frame the scene, adding to the atmosphere of solemnity and finality. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of historical weight and tragedy, while remaining visually engaging and educational. No text is present in the image, the date '1649' is subtly represented by sixteen bare trees on the left and forty-nine on the right.
