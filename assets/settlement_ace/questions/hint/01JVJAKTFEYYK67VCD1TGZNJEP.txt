A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting three distinct scenes arranged horizontally across a 16:9 canvas. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades with subtle hints of red, white, and blue, evoking the UK flag without directly replicating it.

The leftmost scene symbolizes the 1908 Olympics: A sepia-toned, Edwardian-era stadium filled with spectators in period clothing. Athletes in classic sportswear are competing in track and field events, with a focus on the marathon. Above the stadium, a subtle, faded Union Jack flag flutters gently. The central scene represents the 1948 Olympics: A post-war London backdrop with modest, utilitarian architecture. Athletes are shown participating in various sports like cycling and swimming. The atmosphere is one of resilience and hope, with subtle rays of sunlight breaking through the clouds. The rightmost scene captures the 2012 Olympics: A modern, dynamic depiction of the Olympic Park in London. Iconic structures like the Olympic Stadium and the ArcelorMittal Orbit are visible. Athletes are engaged in sports like gymnastics and diving, with a sense of energy and excitement. The scene is filled with vibrant colors and a feeling of contemporary celebration. Each scene should seamlessly blend into the next, creating a visual timeline of the UK's Olympic history, emphasizing the progression from the early 20th century to the modern era.
