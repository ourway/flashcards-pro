A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting a stylized United Kingdom composed of interconnected jigsaw puzzle pieces, predominantly in pastel shades of blue, red, and white, reminiscent of the Union Jack. The central puzzle piece, representing England, features a bustling polling station with a diverse queue of voters. Some voters are clearly marked with a subtle, faded-out EU flag on their sleeves, while others are not. A stylized ballot box sits prominently in the foreground, overflowing with ballot papers. However, a single, distinct jigsaw piece is subtly detached from the main UK puzzle, hovering slightly above and to the right, symbolizing a portion of the electoral process where not all pieces (i.e., voters) fully connect. This detached piece also features a faint EU flag imprint. The overall composition should feel warm and inviting, like a children's book illustration, but with realistic detail in the depiction of the voters and polling station. The sky above the UK puzzle is a soft gradient of pastel blues and pinks, suggesting a sense of calm and order. The art style should be reminiscent of classic storybook illustrations, focusing on clarity and detail rather than abstract representation.
