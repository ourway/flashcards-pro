A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a pile of pound sterling coins and banknotes. The coins are a mix of gold and silver hues, realistically depicting the different denominations. The banknotes are predominantly a pastel blue colour, reminiscent of the UK flag, with subtle hints of pastel red and white in the intricate designs. On the banknotes, depict detailed, realistic portraits of historical British figures. The pile of currency rests upon a stylized, slightly worn, wooden surface, perhaps part of an old British desk. Behind the money, subtly out of focus, is a stylized, hand-drawn rendition of the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom, rendered in muted pastel colours. The overall composition should evoke a sense of history, stability, and British heritage. The art style should aim for photorealism in watercolour, giving a sense of tangible texture and depth to the currency. The lighting is soft and diffused, highlighting the details of the coins and banknotes without harsh shadows. The backdrop should be a plain, off-white colour to further emphasize the central pile of currency.
