A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a Tudor-era tapestry, depicting a solemn scene centered around King Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and creams. In the center, a regal but conflicted Henry VIII, adorned in rich, historically accurate attire with subtle hints of red and gold embroidery, stands to the left of Catherine of Aragon. Catherine, portrayed with dignity and grace, wears a Spanish-style gown in muted blues and creams, subtly hinting at her heritage. Between them, a symbolic cracked wedding band rests upon a velvet cushion. Behind Henry, a faint, ethereal outline of a male child symbolizes his desire for a male heir. Behind Catherine, the Spanish flag is very subtly watermarked into the background. The composition is framed by stylized Tudor roses and heraldic lilies. The background is a muted, textured cream, suggesting a royal chamber. The overall feeling should evoke a sense of historical drama and marital discord, emphasizing the weight of the King's decision. The ratio should be 16:9.
