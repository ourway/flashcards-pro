A serene, hand-drawn 2D watercolor landscape in a 16:9 ratio, reminiscent of John Constable's style, dominates the frame. Rolling green hills, dotted with grazing sheep, stretch towards a pastel-blue sky filled with soft, white clouds. In the foreground, a meandering river reflects the sky, adding depth and tranquility. A lone, ancient oak tree stands prominently on a small hill, its branches reaching towards the heavens. Instead of a police officer, a painter, dressed in period clothing, sits on a stool in front of an easel, capturing the scene on canvas. His palette is filled with blues, greens, and browns, mirroring the colors of the landscape. A gentle breeze rustles the leaves of the oak tree, creating a sense of movement and life. A small, red British telephone box is subtly placed far in the background to add a cultural element. The overall color palette should lean towards the pastel colours, creating a peaceful and idyllic scene that emphasizes Constable's artistic legacy, contrasting with the idea of law enforcement. The style should be realistic and detailed, capturing the essence of the English countryside.
