A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant scene of a football match set against the backdrop of the Welsh countryside. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, subtly incorporating the red and white of the Welsh flag in the team uniforms. The football field is nestled within rolling green hills, dotted with traditional Welsh cottages and grazing sheep. Focus should be on the game itself. Two teams are actively engaged in a match. Each team consists of 11 visible players on the field and 19 players on the bench. The players are realistically rendered, showing dynamic movement and varied expressions of concentration and determination. The referee is shown in the middle of the field blowing his whistle. The sky is a soft, pastel blue with fluffy white clouds. A subtle, almost ethereal glow emanates from the entire scene, lending a sense of idealized tranquility and national pride. The composition is carefully balanced, with the football match taking central stage, and the Welsh landscape providing a serene and distinctly Welsh context. The overall feeling should be one of peaceful activity and the harmonious blend of sport and national identity.
