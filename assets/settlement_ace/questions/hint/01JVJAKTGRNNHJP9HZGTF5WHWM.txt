A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Queen Elizabeth I in her regal attire, standing in a grand hall reminiscent of Tudor architecture. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, interspersed with regal blues and reds inspired by the Union Jack. Elizabeth is adorned with a pearl-studded gown and a delicate lace collar. In the background, stained-glass windows depict scenes of Protestant reformers, such as Martin Luther, subtly integrated within traditional heraldic designs. A soft, ethereal light emanates from the windows, illuminating the hall and casting a gentle glow on the Queen. In her hand, she holds a closed, ornately bound book, symbolizing the Protestant Bible. The overall composition emphasizes Elizabeth's strength and unwavering commitment, with her posture upright and her gaze resolute. The scene evokes a sense of historical accuracy, combined with artistic license to create a memorable and educationally relevant image, subtly conveying her adherence to the Protestant faith through symbolic representation and historical context. The ratio is 16:9, and the Queen is centered in the frame.
