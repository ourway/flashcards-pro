A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a large, intricately designed pie, viewed from directly above. The pie crust is golden brown with delicate, crimped edges. The pie is divided into numerous slices, each representing a constituency. Predominantly, the slices are filled with a vibrant, rich blue filling, subtly reminiscent of the blue in the Union Jack. However, a significant number of slices are filled with a deep red filling, also alluding to the UK flag. A smaller number of slices are filled with white filling. The pie is placed on a rustic wooden table. A single, ornate silver pie server rests beside the pie, positioned as if it has just removed a blue slice. Emanating from the pie, subtle rays of light suggest importance and centrality. The overall composition should be balanced and visually appealing, with a focus on the detailed textures of the pie crust and fillings. The colour palette should be predominantly pastel, with the blue, red, and white fillings providing a gentle contrast against the warm tones of the crust and table. The style should evoke a sense of tradition and solidity, mirroring the established nature of the UK's parliamentary system.
