A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical botanical illustration. The image showcases two intertwined rose bushes. One rose bush features vibrant red roses, symbolizing the House of Lancaster. The other features pure white roses, symbolizing the House of York. The stems of the two rose bushes are visibly entwined and knotted together near the base of the plants, representing the union of the two houses through marriage. At the heart of where the stems meet, a single, exquisitely detailed Tudor rose blooms â€“ a rose with both red and white petals intermixed, perfectly embodying the fusion of the two houses. The background is a soft, muted pastel blue, evoking a sense of peace and reconciliation. Dewdrops cling delicately to the rose petals and leaves, adding a touch of realism and freshness. The composition should be centered, with the intertwined roses as the focal point, set against the pastel blue backdrop. The overall tone should be elegant and symbolic, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements, and strictly adhering to a 2D representation.
