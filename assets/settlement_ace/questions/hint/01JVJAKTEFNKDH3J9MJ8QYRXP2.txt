A hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting a stylized, semi-circular jury box viewed from slightly above, filling the central space of a 16:9 landscape composition. Twelve diverse figures, representing the population of England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, are seated within the box. Each figure is meticulously detailed, with subtle variations in clothing, hairstyle, and skin tone to emphasize inclusivity. The jury box itself is constructed from aged oak, subtly engraved with Celtic knotwork designs along the edges, hinting at the history and traditions of the UK. The backdrop behind the jury box is a soft, muted pastel colour palette of blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag. Above the jury box, twelve stars are arranged in a gentle arc, each star emitting a soft, golden light, symbolizing enlightenment and justice. The overall style is realistic and detailed, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements and resembling a courtroom setting, with pastel colours creating a calm and unbiased atmosphere. The composition focuses on the number 12, with the figures and stars arranged to emphasize this key number related to the question. A subtle, ethereal glow emanates from the entire scene, creating a sense of solemnity and civic duty.
