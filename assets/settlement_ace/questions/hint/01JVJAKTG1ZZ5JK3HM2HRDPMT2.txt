A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting a single hand, palm facing forward, against a softly textured, warm pastel yellow background. Each finger is adorned with a delicately rendered diya (oil lamp), its flame flickering gently with warm, inviting light. The diyas are crafted in a traditional Indian style, made of earthen clay and painted with intricate, colorful patterns in shades of red, blue, and gold. Each diya is slightly different, representing the diversity within the Diwali celebration. The hand itself is rendered with realistic detail, showing subtle skin tones and textures. Around the wrist, a simple, elegant gold bangle adds a touch of festive adornment. The overall composition is centered, with the hand and diyas filling the frame. The pastel yellow background is subtly textured to evoke a sense of warmth and tradition. The light from the diya flames casts a soft, diffused glow on the hand and surrounding background, enhancing the festive atmosphere. The art style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, while maintaining a gentle, hand-painted aesthetic. The colors should primarily be warm pastels, accented by the vibrant colors of the diyas and the gold bangle, creating a visually appealing and memorable image that signifies the five days of Diwali.
