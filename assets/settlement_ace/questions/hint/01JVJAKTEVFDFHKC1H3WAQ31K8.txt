A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a graduation ceremony at a traditional British university, potentially Oxbridge or Cambridge. The scene is bathed in a soft, pastel colour palette dominated by blues and creams, with subtle hints of red echoing the UK flag's colours. In the center, a young woman stands at a podium, delivering a valedictorian speech. She is dressed in a classic black graduation gown with a light blue sash and mortarboard. Her expression is confident and intelligent, and she holds a rolled-up diploma tied with a red ribbon. The podium is adorned with a subtly embossed crest featuring a laurel wreath. The background features a blurred but recognizable image of a grand, Gothic-style university hall filled with rows of graduates in similar attire. Sunlight streams through large stained-glass windows, casting colourful patterns on the scene. The graduates in the audience are diverse in ethnicity, subtly indicating the UK's multicultural society. The overall composition should emphasize the woman's central role and the atmosphere of academic achievement and celebration. The style should be reminiscent of classic British watercolour paintings, with attention to detail and realistic rendering of textures and lighting. The image should be serene and inspiring, conveying the message of female academic success without any textual elements.
