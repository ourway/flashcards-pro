A detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the liberation of Kuwait in the 1990s. The scene centers around a stylized, pastel-colored map of Kuwait, rendered in soft blues and yellows. Overlaid on this map are miniature figures representing British soldiers, easily identifiable by their distinctive helmets and uniforms, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with soldiers from other nations, subtly indicated by variations in uniform color and headgear, all rendered in pastel shades. The figures are facing outwards, towards the viewer, conveying a sense of unified strength and purpose. Behind the soldiers, a faint, stylized representation of oil derricks can be seen, symbolizing Kuwait's resources. Above the scene, a dove of peace, rendered in white with subtle grey shading, flies against a sky of blended pastel blues and pinks, signifying the liberation and the hope for lasting peace. The overall composition should evoke a feeling of collaboration, resolve, and the historical significance of the event. The colors should primarily be pastel variations of red, white, and blue, subtly referencing the Union Jack, and creating a harmonious and educational image. The image should be in 16:9 format, with the main elements concentrated in the center.
