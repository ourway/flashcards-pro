A hand-drawn, realistic, 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting the D-Day landings on a beach in Normandy, France. The art style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and solemnity. The color palette leans toward pastel blues, grays, and browns, with subtle hints of red to subtly reflect the UK flag's color scheme. The composition is centered on a landing craft approaching the shore, with British soldiers disembarking into the shallow water. The soldiers are depicted with determined expressions, wearing historically accurate uniforms and carrying equipment. In the background, the beach is seen with obstacles and the smoke and fire of battle. The cliffs of Normandy rise in the distance, partially obscured by haze. The sky is overcast with subtle light breaking through the clouds, casting a dramatic light on the scene. Symbolic elements include a small, stylized British flag subtly incorporated into the scene, perhaps fluttering from one of the landing crafts. The overall image should convey the scale and intensity of the invasion, while maintaining a respectful and educational tone. The water can be slightly red to resemble blood and the overall feeling should be 'Defiant invasion' to help remember the correct answer.
