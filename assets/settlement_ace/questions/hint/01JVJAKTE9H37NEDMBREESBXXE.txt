A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The artwork features a central figure: King Henry VIII, depicted in his iconic Tudor attire, including a richly embroidered doublet, a jeweled collar, and a crown resting upon his head. The king is positioned centrally in the frame, and surrounding him are six distinct female figures, each representing one of his wives. Each wife should be stylistically different, reflecting their individual personalities and stories. Anne Boleyn might be depicted with a falcon emblem nearby, representing her family crest, while Catherine of Aragon could be holding a pomegranate, symbolizing her Spanish heritage. Jane Seymour could be shown with a phoenix, representing her role in providing a male heir, and so on. The women are not arranged in a linear fashion but rather in a semi-circle around the king, suggesting their interconnectedness and influence on his reign. The background should feature subtle, muted colors reminiscent of Tudor tapestries, with hints of heraldic symbols and roses (the Tudor rose). The overall color palette should lean towards pastel hues, with occasional pops of red and gold to highlight the royal elements. The composition should be balanced, creating a visually harmonious representation of Henry VIII's most famous action: marrying six times. The image should evoke a sense of history, drama, and the complex relationships that defined the Tudor era.
