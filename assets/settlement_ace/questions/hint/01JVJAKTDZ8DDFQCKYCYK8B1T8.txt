A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic historical illustrations. The composition is centered on a bustling ancient British Iron Age village. Dominating the foreground is a blacksmith's forge, rendered in warm, earthy tones contrasting with the cooler metallic grays of the iron being worked. A muscular blacksmith, clad in simple leather garb, hammers a glowing red-hot iron sword on an anvil. Sparks fly upwards, illuminating his determined face. To his left, a pile of finished iron tools – axes, ploughs, and knives – are neatly stacked. Behind the forge, the village unfolds: roundhouses with thatched roofs, villagers tending to crops, and warriors practicing with iron-tipped spears. The overall color palette leans towards the red, white, and blue of the UK flag, with the red represented by the glowing iron and forge fire, the white by the smoke rising from the chimneys, and the blue by the distant hills fading into the background. The lighting is dramatic, casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the wood, stone, and metal. The art style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and the transformative power of iron, emphasizing its role in toolmaking and warfare, alluding to the dawn of a new era for Britain.
