A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style, depicting a solitary figure of a young man, Hamlet, in a dimly lit, grand hall evocative of Elsinore Castle. The hall features tall, arched windows casting long shadows, with faded tapestries adorning the stone walls. Hamlet is dressed in melancholic, dark attire, holding a skull in his right hand. He gazes thoughtfully at the skull, his expression a mix of contemplation and sorrow. A soft, ethereal glow emanates from the skull, subtly highlighting Hamlet's face and the skull itself. The color palette leans towards muted blues, greys, and blacks, with subtle hints of gold in the architectural details, resembling the UK flag colours. The overall composition emphasizes the solitude and introspection of Hamlet, capturing the essence of his famous soliloquy. Focus on intricate details in Hamlet's attire and the skull's texture. The background should be slightly blurred to draw attention to Hamlet and the skull. The image should evoke a sense of drama and intellectual depth, reminiscent of Shakespearean tragedy. The style should be classic and timeless, avoiding any modern or cartoonish elements, and suitable for educational purposes, and drawn in a realistic style.
