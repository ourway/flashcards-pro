A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a vibrant swimming pool scene in Los Angeles, bathed in bright Californian sunlight. The water is a dazzling turquoise, reflecting the clear blue sky. A sleek, mid-century modern house with large glass windows overlooks the pool. A diving board is present, casting a sharp shadow on the water's surface. A figure, subtly resembling David Hockney with his signature round glasses and blonde hair, stands at the edge of the pool, wearing stylish 1960s swimwear. The color palette should resemble pastel colours. Scattered around the pool area are oversized, stylized versions of everyday objects â€“ a giant inflatable flamingo, an enormous pair of sunglasses, and a larger-than-life vinyl record, all rendered in bold, pop-art colors like pink, yellow, and electric blue. These objects symbolize the pop art movement's focus on popular culture. The overall composition should evoke a sense of optimism, leisure, and the vibrant energy of the 1960s. The setting should be distinctly Californian, contrasting with traditional British landscapes, subtly hinting at Hockney's artistic journey and his embrace of new environments. The style should be reminiscent of Hockney's own paintings, particularly his swimming pool series, but without directly copying any specific artwork.
