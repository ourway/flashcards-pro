A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, rendered in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a serene, rolling English countryside scene. Dominating the foreground, a well-dressed gentleman (representing the Gentry) stands on a gentle hill overlooking his estate. He wears clothing typical of the late medieval/early Renaissance period â€“ a finely tailored tunic in muted blue, perhaps with subtle red and white accents echoing the UK flag colors, and soft leather boots. He leans lightly on a walking stick crafted from polished wood. The landscape behind him is lush and green, with fields of wheat swaying gently in the breeze. In the middle distance, a picturesque manor house with stone walls and a slate roof nestled among ancient oak trees can be seen. Scattered across the fields are flocks of sheep, suggesting the agricultural wealth of the estate. The overall color palette should be soft and pastel-toned, creating a sense of peace and prosperity. In the background, subtly hint at the receding effects of the Black Death by depicting a partially overgrown, abandoned village in the distance, symbolizing the shift in land ownership that led to the rise of the Gentry. The sky is a soft, slightly overcast blue, typical of the English climate, with gentle, wispy clouds. The entire image should evoke a sense of historical context and the tranquil power associated with land ownership during that period. The gentleman's expression should be calm and assured, reflecting his status and influence.
