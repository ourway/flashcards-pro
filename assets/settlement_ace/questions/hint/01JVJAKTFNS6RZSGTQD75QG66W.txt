A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a stylized, vibrant double helix DNA strand, rendered in pastel shades of blue and pink, symbolizing medical research. Intertwined around the DNA strand are stylized branches of a blossoming cherry tree, signifying life and renewal, with delicate pink flowers. At the base of the DNA strand, roots resembling intertwined ribbons form the shape of the United Kingdom, subtly incorporating the UK's geographical identity. A radiant, golden light emanates from the center of the DNA, casting a soft glow on the surrounding elements, representing hope and progress. Small, stylized laboratory equipment, such as beakers and microscopes, are subtly integrated into the background, rendered in muted pastel colors, to signify scientific endeavors. The overall composition should evoke a sense of optimism, scientific advancement, and the life-affirming mission of medical research, with the subtle color palette reminiscent of the UK flag. The artwork should be detailed enough to be visually engaging and memorable, while remaining simple and educational.
