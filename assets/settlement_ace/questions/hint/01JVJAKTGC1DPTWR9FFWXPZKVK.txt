A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting depicting the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, England. The bridge should be the central focus, gracefully arching across the Avon Gorge. The gorge walls should be realistically rendered, showcasing the geological layers with subtle color variations in earth tones, ranging from ochre to burnt sienna. The River Avon flows beneath the bridge, reflecting the sky above with soft, shimmering blues and grays. The bridge itself should be painted with precision, highlighting the intricate details of the suspension chains, towers, and supporting structure. Use a pastel color palette with hints of red, white, and blue subtly woven into the detailsâ€”perhaps in the flags gently fluttering from the bridge towers or in the color of the distant buildings on the hillside. The sky should be a soft, watercolour wash of pale blue with wisps of white clouds, suggesting a bright, clear day. In the foreground, on one of the bridge towers, include a small, almost hidden detail: a miniature figure that resembles Isambard Kingdom Brunel, sketched in profile, holding rolled-up blueprints, subtly referencing his role as the bridge's designer. The overall style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, aiming for an educational and visually appealing representation of the engineering masterpiece. The image ratio should be 16:9, with the bridge centered in the composition. The colour palette should be pastel and muted to evoke a sense of calm and grandeur.
