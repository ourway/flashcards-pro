A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Royal Albert Hall bathed in warm, golden light during an evening concert. The hall's intricate architectural details are rendered with precision, showcasing its iconic dome and Victorian design. Inside, the orchestra is in full swing, with musicians meticulously drawn, each holding their instruments. Musical notes, illustrated as glowing, translucent orbs in pastel blues, pinks, and yellows, rise from the stage and float towards the audience, creating a sense of ethereal beauty and movement. The audience is suggested by a sea of softly colored, blurred shapes, implying a large and appreciative crowd. In the foreground, a spotlight shines on a conductor with a focused expression, his baton raised mid-air. The overall color palette should evoke a sense of warmth, elegance, and musical celebration, with the blues, reds, and whites subtly resembling the UK flag. The image should capture the essence of a grand, classical music event, emphasizing the feeling of "promenade concerts" through visual cues of celebration and a vibrant, bustling atmosphere. The image should be 16:9.
