A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a stately building reminiscent of Stormont, the seat of the Northern Ireland Assembly, bathed in the soft, golden light of a late afternoon. The building is framed by a lush, green landscape dotted with rolling hills and grazing sheep, evoking the pastoral beauty of Northern Ireland. In the foreground, a meticulously detailed calendar rests open on a stone bench. The calendar displays only the month of December, with the date the 6th highlighted by a delicate, hand-painted shamrock. Rising from the calendar like a spectral, translucent projection is a stylized Celtic knot, its intertwining strands rendered in shades of blue and red, subtly echoing the colours of the Union Jack. The Celtic knot gently morphs into a stylized image of a lion, roaring softly, symbolizing the strength and establishment of the Parliament. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, greens, and creams, creating a peaceful and historically evocative atmosphere. The composition should be centered and balanced, with the building and calendar acting as focal points, drawing the viewer's eye and creating a memorable visual association with the year 1922 and the establishment of the Northern Ireland Parliament.
