A heartwarming, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic watercolor style, ratio 16:9, depicting a kind veterinarian gently examining a golden retriever. The veterinarian, wearing a traditional white coat, has a stethoscope around their neck and a compassionate expression. The golden retriever is lying comfortably on an examination table covered with a clean, light blue cloth. In the background, subtly blurred, are shelves lined with medicine bottles and veterinary tools, suggesting a well-equipped clinic. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades with accents of red, white, and blue subtly incorporated â€“ perhaps the veterinarian's tie is subtly striped with these colors. Light streams in from a window, casting a soft glow on the scene, highlighting the bond between the vet and the dog. In the bottom right corner, almost hidden, is a small emblem representing a heart with paw prints inside, symbolizing animal charities. The overall composition should evoke feelings of trust, care, and compassion, reinforcing the idea that help is available for pets in need, regardless of their owner's financial situation. The image should be detailed enough to feel realistic but soft enough to be approachable and comforting.
