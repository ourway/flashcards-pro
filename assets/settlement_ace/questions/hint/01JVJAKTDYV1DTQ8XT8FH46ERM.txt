A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image in a realistic style, depicting Ernest Rutherford in his laboratory. Rutherford, a distinguished figure with neatly combed hair and a focused gaze, stands amidst a complex array of scientific apparatus. Dominating the scene is a stylized, central element representing an atom, vividly colored with a pastel palette of blues, pinks, and yellows. Emanating from the atom are fractured lines, suggesting the concept of "splitting." Around Rutherford, depict meticulously detailed scientific instruments such as vacuum pumps, glass tubes, and measuring devices, rendered with precision to reflect the early 20th-century setting. In the background, subtly include elements that evoke the UK, such as a shelf filled with books, one of which has a partially visible spine hinting at "Importance of Being...". The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of scientific discovery and intellectual pursuit. The color scheme should primarily use a pastel palette with subtle hints of red, white, and blue, reminiscent of the UK flag, integrated tastefully into the overall composition. The composition should lead the viewer's eye towards the central atom, making it the focal point of the image, while also highlighting Rutherford's presence and his role in the groundbreaking experiment.
