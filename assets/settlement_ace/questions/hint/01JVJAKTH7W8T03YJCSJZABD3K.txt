A serene, hand-drawn watercolor landscape depicting the British Isles as a calm, pastel-colored sea under a sky of soft blues and whites. Dominating the center of the image are two prominent, yet gentle, lighthouses representing the Justice of the Peace Court and the Magistrates' Court. These lighthouses are painted in a realistic style, with subtle details like weathered stone and gently glowing lanterns. The lighthouses stand on solid, grassy ground that extends slightly into the sea. Small, stylized waves, each representing a minor criminal case, gently lap against the base of the lighthouses. Tiny, symbolic boats, each carrying a single, abstracted figure representing defendants, navigate towards the lighthouses. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel blues, greens, and creams, with accents of red and white in the lighthouse details to subtly evoke the Union Jack. The composition should be balanced and calming, with the lighthouses as the central focus, and the gentle waves and small boats adding depth and narrative. The art style should be reminiscent of classic British landscape paintings, with a focus on detail and atmospheric perspective. The scene should convey a sense of order, peace, and the quiet administration of justice.
