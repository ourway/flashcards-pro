A hand-drawn, realistic, 2D watercolor painting in a landscape orientation (16:9) depicting an Anglo-Saxon ship burial. The central focus is a partially excavated burial mound in a field in Suffolk, England. The mound is cut away to reveal a longship within. Inside the ship, the skeletal remains of a king are visible, adorned with golden jewelry, a helmet, and surrounded by various artifacts: swords, shields, and ornate drinking horns. The king's armor has intricate designs. The color palette should lean towards pastel tones, with the gold elements providing a warm contrast. The overall scene should evoke a sense of history, mystery, and the wealth associated with Anglo-Saxon royalty. In the background, rolling green hills, typical of the Suffolk landscape, are visible under a slightly overcast sky. The art style should be reminiscent of historical illustrations, aiming for accuracy and detail. The composition should emphasize the serenity and solitude of the burial site within the Suffolk countryside, with the ship serving as the focal point of the composition. The sun is setting, casting a warm glow on the burial mound.
