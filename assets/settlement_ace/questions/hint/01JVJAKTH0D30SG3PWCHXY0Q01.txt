A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a classic watercolor painting, depicting a serene Scottish Highlands landscape at twilight. The color palette leans heavily on pastel blues, purples, and heather greens, subtly echoing the Scottish flag. In the foreground, a solitary figure resembling Robert Burns stands on a small hillock, quill in hand, gazing towards a village nestled in the valley below. The village is aglow with warm light emanating from the windows of homes and a central pub, suggesting a New Year's Eve celebration. Wisps of smoke rise from chimneys, curling into the dusky sky. Around the figure, heather and thistles, symbolic of Scotland, grow in abundance. The wind gently rustles the figure's hair and kilt. A faint, ethereal musical staff and notes, almost transparent, emanate from the village and float towards the figure, visually representing the melody of "Auld Lang Syne." The composition should focus on the figure and the village, creating a sense of connection between the poet and the community celebrating his work. The overall mood should be peaceful, reflective, and celebratory, emphasizing the cultural significance of the song and its creator. The image should convey a sense of Scottish heritage and the enduring legacy of Robert Burns. The ratio should be 16:9.
