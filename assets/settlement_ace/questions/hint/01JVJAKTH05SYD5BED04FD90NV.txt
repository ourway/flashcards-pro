A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Prime Minister of the UK in their office at 10 Downing Street. The Prime Minister, a figure of authority and composure, stands at a large, ornate desk piled with official documents and folders bearing the Royal Coat of Arms. In front of the desk, extending outwards in a semi-circular formation, are several chairs, each occupied by uniquely dressed individuals representing different cabinet positions. A warm, pastel color palette dominates the scene, with subtle reds, blues, and whites echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The light source is a soft, diffused glow emanating from a large window behind the desk, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the Prime Minister as the central figure. The overall composition suggests the Prime Minister's role as the orchestrator and leader, carefully selecting and arranging their team. The background includes subtle details of the office, such as framed portraits of former Prime Ministers and bookshelves filled with bound volumes, adding depth and historical context. The scene should convey a sense of order, responsibility, and the importance of the Prime Minister's decision-making process in forming the cabinet.
