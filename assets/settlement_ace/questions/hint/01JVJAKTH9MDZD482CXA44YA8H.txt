A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a dramatic night scene over London during World War II, rendered in a pastel color palette with hues reminiscent of the UK flag (primarily blues, reds, and whites). The central focus is on the silhouette of the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben, partially obscured by thick, swirling clouds of smoke and dust rendered in shades of grey and pastel blue. Streaks of bright orange and yellow represent explosions erupting around the city skyline, not overwhelming but clearly indicating widespread bombardment. Searchlights, depicted as thin beams of white light, crisscross the sky, attempting to pierce the darkness and smoke. In the foreground, slightly out of focus, are rooftops of typical London houses, some with visible damage like missing tiles and partially collapsed walls. The overall composition emphasizes the contrast between the iconic landmarks and the destructive force of the bombing. The scene should evoke a sense of chaos and destruction, but also resilience. The watercolor style should give a soft, almost dreamlike quality, making the scene less overtly violent but still conveying the gravity of the situation. Small details, such as rubble scattered on the streets and the faint glow of fires reflected in puddles, add to the realism and depth of the image. The sky should be a deep, stormy blue, with subtle gradations of color to suggest depth and atmosphere.
