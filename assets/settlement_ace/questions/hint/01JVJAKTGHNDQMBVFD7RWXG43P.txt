A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Scottish Highlands in 1746. The scene centers on a weathered, ancient standing stone, its surface etched with faint Celtic knotwork. Around the base of the stone, a shattered Highland broadsword lies in pieces, its blade reflecting the somber grey light of a cloudy sky. The sword is snapped into three pieces. Radiating outwards from the stone are fragmented tartan patterns, each representing a different Scottish clan (Mackenzie, Campbell, MacLeod, etc.). The tartan fragments are torn and faded, gradually dissolving into the misty background. Dominant colors are muted blues, greys, and greens, reflecting the melancholic atmosphere. The overall composition should convey a sense of loss and fragmentation, symbolizing the diminished power of the clans after the Battle of Culloden. The background features a blurred depiction of the moorland landscape, subtly suggesting the battlefield. The sky is overcast and heavy, mirroring the somber mood. The entire image should evoke a feeling of historical significance and the enduring legacy of the clans, specifically their loss of power following a significant defeat.
