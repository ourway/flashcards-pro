A hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a somber scene set against a misty Scottish landscape. The colour palette should be primarily pastel blues, greys, and whites, invoking a sense of melancholy and confinement. The central focus is a tall, imposing castle tower, its stone weathered and aged, rendered with meticulous detail to show the texture of the stonework. Emanating from behind the tower is a faint, ethereal shadow in the shape of a Scottish thistle intertwined with the bars of a prison cell. Within the shadow, a translucent figure representing Mary, Queen of Scots, is visible, her face etched with sadness but retaining a regal bearing. She is dressed in simple, muted clothing, contrasting with the ornate gowns she was known for. The background features a rolling, heather-covered moor, fading into a distant, hazy horizon. Light from the moon breaks through the clouds, casting long shadows and highlighting the isolation of the tower. The overall composition emphasizes the oppressive atmosphere of imprisonment and the passage of time, with subtle details like ivy creeping up the tower walls to symbolize the years spent in captivity. The image should evoke a sense of history and the personal tragedy of Mary, Queen of Scots, without being overly dramatic or graphic.
