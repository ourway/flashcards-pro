A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image depicting a grand, classical-style building representing the UK Parliament, rendered in soft, pastel colors reminiscent of a serene, overcast London day. The building's architecture should be distinctly British, featuring elements like a clock tower subtly inspired by Big Ben, without directly copying it. Swirling around the Parliament building are numerous stylized, pastel-colored ribbons, each representing a different pressure group or lobby group. These ribbons are not chaotic but rather organized in flowing patterns, gently 'pressing' against the building, suggesting influence and shaping. Each ribbon has a unique pattern and texture, visually representing the diverse nature of these organizations, some wide and prominent, others narrower and more subtle. The overall composition should convey a sense of gentle but persistent influence. The sky is a muted, pastel blue, and the ground features a soft, green lawn with stylized, pastel-colored flowers scattered subtly, adding to the calm and influential atmosphere. The art style should be realistic yet soft, avoiding harsh lines or overly defined edges, creating a visual mnemonic of the gentle but constant pressure and lobbying that shapes government policies. The image must be strictly 2D and not 3D and should not include any text or numbers.
