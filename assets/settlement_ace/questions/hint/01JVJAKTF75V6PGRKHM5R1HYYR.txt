A vibrant, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic style depicting a whimsical cross-country race across the British countryside. The scene is set in a rolling green landscape with patchwork fields, reminiscent of the English countryside, under a pastel blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The finish line is prominently positioned in the center of the 16:9 landscape, marked by a traditional red British post box firmly planted in the ground, adorned with a golden laurel wreath. Several diverse runners are depicted energetically sprinting towards the post box. The runner in the lead, slightly ahead of the others, is wearing a blue jersey. Trailing closely behind are runners in pastel shades of yellow, green, and pink, their faces showing determination. The color palette should be primarily pastel colors, with the red post box serving as a focal point, subtly referencing the UK flag's colors. The overall composition should convey a sense of friendly competition and forward momentum, emphasizing the "first past the post" concept through visual storytelling. The art style should evoke a sense of nostalgia and tradition, avoiding any modern or overly cartoonish elements.
