A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic, watercolor style, reminiscent of historical illustrations. The scene is set in a dimly lit, stone cellar beneath the Houses of Parliament in 1605. At the center, Guy Fawkes, a man with a neatly trimmed beard and mustache, dressed in dark, period clothing, stands beside a large wooden barrel overflowing with gunpowder. Sparks are subtly emanating from a small pile of kindling near the barrel, hinting at the imminent danger. The color palette should primarily consist of muted earth tones – browns, grays, and deep reds – with occasional flashes of orange and yellow to represent the flickering candlelight that illuminates the scene. Emphasize the conspiratorial atmosphere with deep shadows and a sense of claustrophobia. The barrel should be prominently displayed, its wooden texture rendered with fine detail. The faces of several other conspirators, partially obscured by shadow, should be visible in the background, adding to the sense of intrigue. The overall composition should evoke a sense of historical drama and the gravity of the Gunpowder Plot, creating a memorable visual mnemonic for the event memorialized on Guy Fawkes Night. The image ratio is 16:9, with the main focus centered within the frame.
