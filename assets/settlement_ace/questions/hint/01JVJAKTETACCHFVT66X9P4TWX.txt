A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting Cardiff Castle as the central focal point. The castle should be rendered with historical accuracy, showcasing its stone walls, towers, and Welsh flags fluttering gently in a breeze. In the foreground, imagine a stack of elegantly designed, oversized playing cards, each bearing the emblem of Wales â€“ the red Welsh Dragon. These cards are not scattered randomly but neatly arranged, suggesting order and officialdom. The color palette should be predominantly pastel, with soft blues, greens, and whites, accented by the vibrant red of the dragons and flags. The sky above Cardiff Castle should be a watercolor wash of light blue, with subtle hints of cloud formations, adding depth and realism to the scene. The overall composition should evoke a sense of Welsh heritage, the official nature of government, and the specific location of Cardiff. The art style should lean towards realism, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements to ensure the image is easily recognizable and educational. The image should focus on linking the idea of official government documents represented by cards, to the location of Cardiff through the depiction of the castle.
