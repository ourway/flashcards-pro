A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image depicting a classic Ulster Fry breakfast, presented on a rustic wooden table. The scene is set in a cozy, sunlit kitchen with a window in the background overlooking rolling green hills reminiscent of the Northern Irish countryside. The Ulster Fry itself is the central focus: a generous plate featuring perfectly cooked bacon with crispy edges, plump sausages with a golden-brown hue, a fried egg with a vibrant orange yolk, grilled tomatoes glistening with moisture, and golden-brown potato farls, their surfaces slightly crinkled. Also included are black and white pudding slices, each with distinct textures and colors. Subtle steam rises gently from the hot food, adding a sense of warmth and freshness. The color palette leans towards the pastel spectrum, with muted reds, browns, yellows, and greens dominating the scene. The overall composition is balanced and inviting, emphasizing the hearty and comforting nature of the Ulster Fry. The art style should be realistic, capturing the textures and details of each component of the breakfast. The image should evoke a sense of traditional Northern Irish hospitality and culinary heritage. The 16:9 ratio ensures that the focus remains on the breakfast spread, with the background providing a subtle context without distracting from the main subject.
