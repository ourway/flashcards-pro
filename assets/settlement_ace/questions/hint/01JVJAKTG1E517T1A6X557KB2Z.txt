A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a single, exquisitely detailed Tudor Rose, centrally positioned against a soft, blurred background suggesting an English garden. The rose should be primarily white with subtle crimson accents on the outer edges of the petals, mimicking the traditional depiction of the Tudor Rose. The petals should exhibit delicate shading to convey a sense of depth and texture, capturing the velvety softness of a real rose. The stem and leaves should be a muted green, with subtle hints of brown to indicate a natural, earthy quality. Dewdrops should glisten subtly on a few of the petals and leaves, adding a touch of realism and freshness. The background should feature hints of other garden flowers in pastel hues – blues, pinks, and yellows – creating a soft, impressionistic backdrop without distracting from the central rose. The composition should evoke a sense of classic English beauty and tranquility. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades, interspersed with the bolder red and green, reminiscent of the UK flag, to create a visually harmonious and memorable image. The art style should emulate classic botanical illustrations, focusing on accuracy and delicate detail, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements. The image ratio is 16:9.
