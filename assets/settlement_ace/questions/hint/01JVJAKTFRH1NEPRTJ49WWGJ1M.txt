A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The colour palette leans heavily on pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the UK flag. Centrally positioned is a split composition. On the left, a portrait of Alan Turing rendered in a soft, slightly desaturated pastel blue. Behind him, faint, almost ghostly images of early computer components – vacuum tubes, punch cards, and gears – swirl like a nebula, hinting at the birth of computer science. A faint Enigma machine can be seen in the background. On the right side, a portrait of Tim Berners-Lee, coloured in pastel red. Behind him, a network of interconnected nodes and lines representing the internet spreads outwards, resembling a vast, intricate web. Small icons of early websites and browsers are subtly embedded within the web. A faint image of the World Wide Web logo is visible in the background. The overall effect should be one of innovation and interconnectedness, with a vintage feel reminiscent of early 20th-century scientific illustrations. The portraits should be respectful and dignified, avoiding caricature. The background elements should be detailed enough to be recognizable, but not so overwhelming that they detract from the central figures. The image should evoke a sense of historical significance and technological advancement.
