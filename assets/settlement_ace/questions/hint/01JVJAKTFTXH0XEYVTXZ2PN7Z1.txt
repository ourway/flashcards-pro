A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolour style, depicting a vibrant scene centered around a tennis match at Wimbledon. The image ratio is 16:9. The focal point is a tennis court with meticulously rendered grass, showcasing the characteristic Wimbledon green. Two tennis players, one male and one female, are captured mid-serve and mid-return respectively, their forms displaying realistic athletic movement. The players' attire is predominantly white, in keeping with Wimbledon tradition. The backdrop features a crowd of spectators, subtly suggested through a blurred effect, dressed in smart-casual summer attire, with pastel-coloured hats and parasols adding visual interest. In the lower right corner of the image, arrange a vignette of a classic Wimbledon treat: a punnet of strawberries accompanied by a dollop of cream in a delicate china bowl. The colour palette leans heavily on the green of the grass, the white of the tennis outfits, and the red and white of the strawberries and cream, subtly echoing the colours of the UK flag while maintaining a soft, pastel aesthetic overall. The style should evoke a sense of quintessential British summertime and sporting tradition. No text should be present in the image.
