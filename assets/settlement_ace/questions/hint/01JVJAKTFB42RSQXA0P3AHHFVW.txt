A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the climactic moment of the battle between the English fleet and the Spanish Armada. The scene is set on a turbulent sea, rendered in deep blues and greens, reflecting the stormy conditions that aided the English. In the center of the composition, an English galleon, sails billowing in the wind, is locked in combat with a larger Spanish ship. The English ship is painted with red and white accents, reminiscent of the St. George's Cross. The Spanish ship is adorned with golden and crimson details, showing its royal association. Cannons are firing from both vessels, with puffs of white smoke obscuring parts of the scene. Debris from damaged ships floats on the water's surface. Above, the sky is a dramatic mix of dark, stormy grey clouds contrasted by a single, powerful ray of light breaking through, illuminating the English flag flying high on the mast of the English galleon. The overall color palette leans towards blues, reds, and whites, echoing the colors of the Union Jack, with subtle hints of gold and crimson to represent Spain. The composition emphasizes the English ship's resilience and strategic positioning amidst the chaos, symbolizing their eventual victory. The artistic style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and grand naval warfare, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements.
