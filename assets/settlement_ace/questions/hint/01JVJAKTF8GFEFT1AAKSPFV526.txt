A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting two distinct halves of a grand English estate garden, symbolizing "Sense and Sensibility." The left half of the garden represents "Sense": it is geometrically precise, with neatly trimmed hedges forming perfect squares and rectangles, orderly rows of lavender bushes in full bloom, and a classical stone sundial casting a long, accurate shadow. The color palette here leans towards cool blues, greens, and grays, evoking a sense of rationality and control. On the right half of the garden, representing "Sensibility," the landscape is wilder and more romantic. Roses and honeysuckle climb freely over an arched trellis, wildflowers bloom in vibrant disarray, and a small, reflective pond mirrors the cloudy sky above. The colors here are warmer, with rich reds, pinks, and yellows dominating. A gentle breeze rustles through the leaves on both sides. In the very center of the image, where the two halves meet, a stone bench is positioned, subtly suggesting the interplay and balance between reason and emotion. The overall style should evoke the atmosphere of 18th-century England.
