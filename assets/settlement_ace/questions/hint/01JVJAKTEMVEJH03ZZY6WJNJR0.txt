A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, rendered in a pastel color palette of blues, reds, and creams, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a symbolic representation of the Prime Minister kneeling before a regal, yet approachable, Queen. The Prime Minister, depicted in a dark blue suit, extends a scroll towards the Queen, who is seated on an ornate throne. The scroll is tied with a red ribbon and bears a subtle, stylized crest representing the House of Lords. The Queen, adorned in a cream-colored gown and a delicate tiara, holds a golden scepter, not pointed aggressively, but resting gently in her hand. Behind the Queen, a stained-glass window diffuses soft light, casting gentle hues of red, white, and blue. The window's design incorporates subtle symbols of the UK's constituent countries: a rose (England), a thistle (Scotland), a daffodil (Wales), and a shamrock (Northern Ireland). The throne is positioned on a patterned carpet with muted UK flag colors, avoiding direct representation. The overall atmosphere should be one of respectful counsel and established tradition, emphasizing the Prime Minister's advisory role to the Monarch in the appointment of life peers.
