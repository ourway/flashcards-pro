A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a beautifully rendered portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, depicted in her later years with a kind, regal expression. She is wearing a royal blue gown adorned with subtle, intricate embroidery. At the Queen's heart level, there is a golden harp, subtly glowing, with visible sound waves emanating from it, representing the music of the anthem. The background features a stylized, pastel-colored version of the British flag, with the red and blue hues softened to gentle shades. The flag gently fades out from the center. Above the Queen's head, a stylized, ornate crown floats, also subtly glowing. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and golds, evoking a sense of tradition, respect, and gentle patriotism. The composition is centered, with the Queen as the primary subject, ensuring the image is easily memorable. The art style is reminiscent of classic portraiture, with soft lighting and fine detail. The image aims to associate the Queen with the concept of the national anthem, visually prompting the viewer to recall "God Save the Queen." The sound waves are a visual representation of music, linking the Queen to the song.
