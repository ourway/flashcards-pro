A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting two distinct scenes, side-by-side, within a 16:9 landscape format. The color palette leans towards pastel hues, subtly incorporating reds, whites, and blues reminiscent of the UK flag. The left scene features a stylized depiction of Dover's white cliffs, with a gentle flow of diverse people arriving by ferry. These people are rendered in soft, neutral tones, suggesting a sense of global origin, and are being greeted by stylized UK border officials in simple uniforms. The right scene showcases a rolling, green countryside landscape with a squadron of modern fighter jets soaring high above. Silhouetted against the sky are stylized representations of soldiers on parade. Both scenes are framed with delicate, intertwining branches of shamrock and thistle, symbolizing Northern Ireland's connection to the broader UK but also its unique identity. The overall composition aims for a balanced, serene aesthetic, focusing on clear, easily identifiable elements that subtly hint at the concepts of immigration control and national defence, both presented as being overseen by a larger, implied authority beyond the immediate landscape. The style should be realistic but soft, avoiding harsh lines or overly dramatic shading, creating a calm, educational visual aid.
