A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of a Beatrix Potter illustration, depicting a tranquil village green scene in the UK. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades with subtle nods to the UK flag (red accents, blue sky, white clouds). In the center of the 16:9 frame, two figures, a baker and a gardener, are seated at a small, round wooden table under the shade of a blossoming apple tree. The baker, with flour dusting his apron, gestures amiably with a rolling pin, while the gardener, in wellington boots, responds with a trowel in hand. On the table between them sits a freshly baked pie (representing the baker's claim) and a basket overflowing with vibrant vegetables (representing the gardener's claim). The apple tree's branches reach out, framing the scene in a gentle arc, symbolizing a peaceful resolution. Scattered around the base of the tree are fallen apples, suggesting the minor nature of the dispute. In the background, a quaint village pub with a thatched roof and flower boxes adds to the idyllic British setting. The overall composition should evoke a sense of calm, informality, and neighborly resolution, highlighting the swiftness and low-cost nature of settling minor disputes. The sky above is a pale blue with fluffy white clouds, further enhancing the serene atmosphere. The image should avoid any harsh lines or overly dramatic shadows, focusing instead on soft, natural light and delicate details.
