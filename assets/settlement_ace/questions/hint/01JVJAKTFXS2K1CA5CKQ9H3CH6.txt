A meticulously hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic, watercolor style depicting a stylized Tudor rose. The rose is predominantly a blend of deep red and pure white, swirled artfully together to symbolize the union of the Houses of Lancaster and York. The petals are layered and detailed, showcasing the delicate gradients where the red and white hues merge. The central part of the rose features subtle hints of gold to indicate royalty and importance. The background is a soft, blurred pastel blue, reminiscent of a clear sky, providing a gentle contrast that makes the rose the focal point. The rose is positioned centrally in the 16:9 landscape frame. Subtle water droplets glisten on the petals, adding a touch of realism and freshness. The overall composition exudes elegance and historical significance, aiming to create a memorable visual association with the Tudor dynasty for educational purposes. The art style should evoke the feeling of an illustration from a historical botanical encyclopedia, with a focus on accurate representation and delicate color gradients.
