A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The scene depicts a symbolic representation of Scotland merging into Great Britain after the 1707 Act of Union, using a pastel color palette inspired by the UK flag. The central focus is a majestic, yet slightly faded, Scottish flag (St. Andrew's Cross/Saltire) gradually dissolving and blending into a larger, more vibrant Union Jack. Wisps of blue and white from the Scottish flag intertwine with the red, white, and blue of the Union Jack, symbolizing the integration. Behind the flags, a faded outline of the Scottish Highlands transitions into the rolling hills of the English countryside, further representing the geographical union. A single, broken chain lies at the base of the flags, signifying the loss of Scotland's independent nation status. The overall mood should be reflective and slightly melancholic, emphasizing the historical significance of the event. The artwork aims to evoke a sense of unity and transition, using soft, blended watercolor techniques to create a visually engaging and memorable image that highlights the consequence of the Act of Union for Scotland.
