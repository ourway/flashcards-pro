A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting the British Houses of Parliament, specifically focusing on the House of Commons chamber. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The composition is centered, with the Speaker's chair as the focal point. To the left (viewer's left) of the chair, a slightly smaller group of figures is seated, bathed in a slightly softer light. These figures represent the opposition party. The figures on the right of the chair (viewer's right) are rendered with slightly more vibrant colors and are more numerous, symbolizing the majority party. A symbolic, hand-drawn banner, draped subtly behind the opposition figures, displays the numeral "2" in a classic serif font, rendered in a muted gold color. The banner is partially obscured, suggesting their secondary status. The overall atmosphere is one of respectful debate and political process, with architectural details of the House of Commons carefully rendered in a realistic style, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of depth and realism within the 2D image.
