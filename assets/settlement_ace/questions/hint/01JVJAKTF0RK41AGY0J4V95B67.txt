A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style, depicting a vibrant scene reminiscent of the late 1960s in the UK, using a pastel colour palette with hints of red, white, and blue. The central focus is on a group of young adults, around 18 years old, standing in front of a polling station. They are diverse in appearance, reflecting the multicultural nature of modern Britain. The polling station should have a simple, understated design, perhaps a community hall or school building, with a clear sign indicating "Polling Station." The clothing of the young adults should be characteristic of the late 1960s â€“ think bell-bottom jeans, floral patterns, and perhaps a few wearing peace symbols. One of the young adults is confidently placing their ballot into the ballot box. In the background, subtle imagery of iconic 1960s symbols, such as a vinyl record or a classic British car like a Mini Cooper, can be included, but these should be blurred and not the main focus. The overall mood should be optimistic and celebratory, capturing the sense of empowerment and change associated with the lowering of the voting age. The sky above is a soft pastel blue, with gentle clouds. The composition should be centered, drawing the viewer's eye to the act of voting and the youthful energy of the participants.
