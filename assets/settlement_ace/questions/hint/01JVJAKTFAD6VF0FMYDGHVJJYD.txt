A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting Margaret Thatcher in a powerful and symbolic pose. The scene is set in front of the iconic Houses of Parliament, rendered in soft, pastel shades of blue and grey, evoking a sense of British heritage and history. Thatcher stands slightly off-center, her figure bathed in a warm, golden light, symbolizing her influential leadership. In her right hand, she firmly holds a stylized iron scepter, its design subtly incorporating the shape of the British Isles. This represents her nickname, "The Iron Lady," and her strong will. Radiating outwards from the scepter, delicate cracks are visible in a sheet of glass that hovers in front of her, signifying the "glass ceiling" she shattered. The cracks are not violent or destructive but rather elegant and transformative, resembling frost patterns on a windowpane. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, soft reds, and whites, subtly mirroring the Union Jack. The overall composition should convey a sense of strength, determination, and historical significance, creating a memorable visual representation of Margaret Thatcher's achievement as the UK's first female Prime Minister. The image should be devoid of any text, relying solely on visual storytelling to convey its message.
