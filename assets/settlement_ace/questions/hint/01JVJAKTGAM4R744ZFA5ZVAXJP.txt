A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic book illustrations. The scene is set in a warmly lit, well-organised 18th-century study. Dominating the center is a portrait of Adam Smith, depicted not as a stern figure, but with a thoughtful, slightly amused expression, hinting at the revolutionary nature of his ideas. The portrait is framed ornately, with subtle Scottish thistle motifs incorporated into the design. Below the portrait, a large, open book rests on a mahogany desk, its pages filled with elegant handwriting and mathematical equations related to economics. Gold coins and stacks of neatly arranged banknotes are scattered discreetly around the book, symbolising wealth and commerce. In the background, a globe stands partially visible, alluding to the global impact of Smith's economic theories. Light streams in from a window, casting soft shadows and highlighting the textures of the paper, wood, and fabric. The overall colour palette should lean towards pastel shades with the colours of the UK flag subtly embedded, with predominant blues, reds, and creams, lending a timeless, scholarly atmosphere. The composition should focus on balance and clarity, ensuring all elements contribute to a cohesive and memorable visual representation of Adam Smith's contributions to economics.
