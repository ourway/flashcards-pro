A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic, watercolor style, depicting the Battle of Hastings. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag. Centered in the 16:9 landscape composition is William the Conqueror on horseback, clad in Norman armor, raising his sword triumphantly. His horse is a powerful, muscular steed, its barding subtly decorated with Norman patterns. Around him, a chaotic but organized array of Norman soldiers engage in battle with Anglo-Saxon warriors. The Anglo-Saxons, depicted with round shields and axes, fight valiantly but are clearly losing ground. Scattered across the battlefield are fallen soldiers and broken weapons, illustrating the intensity of the conflict. In the background, the English countryside rolls gently towards the horizon, where a faint outline of the English Channel can be seen. The sky is overcast, with subtle hints of sunlight breaking through the clouds, casting dramatic shadows across the scene. The overall mood is one of decisive victory, with a clear emphasis on the Norman influence and the historical significance of 1066. The image should evoke a sense of profound change and the beginning of a new era in English history, focusing solely on visual storytelling without any textual elements.
