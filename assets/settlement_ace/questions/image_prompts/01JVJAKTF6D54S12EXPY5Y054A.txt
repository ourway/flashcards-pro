A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic medical textbooks. The scene is set in a bright, airy laboratory, bathed in soft, natural light filtering through a large window. The primary subject is a distinguished-looking, middle-aged man with a neatly trimmed beard and glasses, John MacLeod, wearing a traditional white lab coat, intently observing a complex glass apparatus used for chemical extraction. Dominating the foreground is a meticulously rendered Scottish Terrier ("MacLeod" dog breed), sitting patiently at the scientist's feet, its gaze directed upwards with loyalty and intelligence. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, creams, and soft reds, evoking the colors of the Scottish flag. Behind MacLeod, on a wooden lab bench, are various scientific instruments â€“ beakers, test tubes filled with liquids of different hues, and a detailed diagram illustrating the molecular structure of insulin. A subtle, almost ethereal glow emanates from the diagram, symbolizing the life-saving impact of insulin. In the background, partially obscured by the lab equipment, is a portrait of a family, subtly hinting at the personal motivation behind the scientist's dedication. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, with a focus on clarity and detail to enhance the educational value of the image. The soft, watercolor style lends a sense of warmth and accessibility, making the complex subject matter more approachable.
