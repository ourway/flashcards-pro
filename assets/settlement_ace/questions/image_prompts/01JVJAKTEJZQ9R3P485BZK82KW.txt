A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a scene that seamlessly blends elements of Sikh and Hindu Diwali celebrations. The image is set against a twilight sky, transitioning from deep blue to warm orange near the horizon. In the center, a traditional Hindu diya lamp, made of terracotta, glows brightly, casting a warm light. Around the diya, intricate henna patterns adorn hands in a gesture of offering or prayer. To the left, a Khanda, the symbol of Sikhism, is subtly incorporated into a rangoli pattern on the ground, created with colourful powders. The rangoli design includes traditional Diwali motifs like lotus flowers and geometric patterns, but with the Khanda forming the central element. Small oil lamps and candles are scattered around the rangoli, illuminating the design. The background subtly features elements of both cultures: a glimpse of a Hindu temple spire and a Sikh Gurdwara dome, both softly lit. The overall color palette uses deep blues, oranges, reds, and yellows, reminiscent of the UK flag and a pastel color palette, evoking a sense of warmth, festivity, and spiritual harmony. The composition focuses on symmetry and balance, visually representing the equal importance of both Sikh and Hindu traditions in celebrating Diwali.
