A hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a vintage watercolor painting, depicting a scene symbolizing women gaining the right to vote after the First World War. The color palette should be predominantly pastel, incorporating subtle hints of red, white, and blue to subtly allude to the UK flag. The central focus is a group of women standing in front of a polling station. They are dressed in early 20th-century attire, reflecting the fashion of the post-World War I era. Some wear hats adorned with subtle suffragette ribbons in purple, white, and green. Their faces express a mix of hope, determination, and a hint of sorrow, acknowledging the sacrifices made during the war. In the background, blurred and slightly out of focus, are symbolic representations of the First World War - poppies growing in a field (representing remembrance), and a silhouette of soldiers marching away. The polling station is a simple, brick building with a queue of women patiently waiting. A banner above the entrance reads "Votes for Women" in elegant, hand-lettered calligraphy (this text should be replaced with floral ornamentation, while retaining the shape and placement to suggest the banner). The overall composition should evoke a sense of historical significance and the bittersweet victory of women's suffrage achieved in the wake of a devastating global conflict. Sunlight filters through the clouds, casting a soft, hopeful glow on the scene.
