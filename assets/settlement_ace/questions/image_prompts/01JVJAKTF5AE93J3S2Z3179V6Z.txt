A hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a stylized, yet realistic, open book titled "Electoral Register" with blank lines waiting to be filled. The book rests on a polished wooden table bathed in soft, natural light filtering through a window. A quill pen, partially dipped in an inkwell filled with dark blue ink, lies beside the book, suggesting the act of writing. Emerging from the book, but still contained within the central frame, are subtle, pastel-colored wisps of smoke that gently coalesce into the faint outline of the Houses of Parliament. The wisps use a pastel colour palette of light red, blue, and white. The paper of the register should be an aged, slightly yellowed parchment colour. The wooden table should appear sturdy and traditional. The overall color scheme should evoke a sense of history, civic duty, and the power of individual participation. The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish elements, with soft edges and gentle gradients in the watercolor, creating a warm and inviting visual that encourages viewers to associate the act of registering with the democratic process. The background is a blurred, light-filled room suggesting an office or study, keeping the focus on the register, pen, and emerging Parliament. The central composition should be strong, drawing the eye immediately to the book and the suggestion of participation in the electoral process.
