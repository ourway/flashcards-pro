A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a classic seesaw set against the backdrop of the Houses of Parliament in London. The color palette should primarily utilize pastel shades of red, white, and blue, reminiscent of the UK flag. On one end of the seesaw, illustrate a downward-tilting, ornately decorated chair representing the Prime Minister's seat. The chair is slightly faded in color, suggesting a decline in power. On the opposite end, show another ornate chair, but this one is ascending and vibrant in color, symbolizing the leader of the Opposition poised to take power. The chair is clean and bright, contrasting with the faded one. Subtle light rays emanate from the ascending chair, further emphasizing its rise. The background should feature a soft, watercolor rendering of the Houses of Parliament, with the iconic Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) visible but not overpowering the central image. The seesaw itself should be made of polished wood, adding a touch of elegance. The overall composition should be balanced, drawing the eye to the dynamic movement of the seesaw and the contrasting chairs, visually representing the shift in power during a General Election. The image should evoke a sense of political transition and the balance of power within the UK government.
