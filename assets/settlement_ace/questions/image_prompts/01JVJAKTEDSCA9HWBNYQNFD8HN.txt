A watercolour-style 2D illustration in a realistic style, depicting a grand, ornate music sheet resting on a dark mahogany music stand. The music sheet is aged and slightly yellowed, hinting at its historical significance. The opening bars of the UK National Anthem are faintly visible, but not legible. Above the music sheet, a stylized, luminous royal crown hovers gently, bathed in a soft, golden light. Emanating from the crown are subtle, ethereal sound waves, visually representing the music being played. Behind the music stand, a backdrop featuring a stained-glass window inspired by Westminster Abbey is visible, with the dominant colours being deep blues and reds, reminiscent of the Union Jack. The overall composition should evoke a sense of reverence and national pride. Pastel colours should feature prominently, creating a calm and educational visual. The music sheet and the crown should be the focal point, with the background providing context without distracting from the central theme. The ratio should be 16:9.
