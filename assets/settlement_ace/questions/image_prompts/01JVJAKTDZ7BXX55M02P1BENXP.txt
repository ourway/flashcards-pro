A vibrant, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a majestic Welsh Red Dragon perched atop the highest peak of Snowdonia. The dragon, with scales in varying shades of red and gold, breathes a small puff of smoke, suggesting watchful guardianship. The mountain itself is rendered with intricate detail, showcasing its rugged terrain, lush green valleys, and sparkling blue lakes. The sky above is a soft pastel blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. In the foreground, a traditional Welsh stone wall meanders through the landscape, adding to the sense of place. The composition is centered on the dragon and mountain, emphasizing their importance. The overall color palette leans towards the reds and whites of the Welsh flag, with touches of green and blue to represent the natural beauty of Snowdonia. The image should evoke a sense of Welsh pride and clearly associate the dragon and the mountain range with Wales, subtly negating any association with Scotland. No text is present in the image.
