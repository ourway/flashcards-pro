A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is on a stylized yet somber depiction of the Houses of Parliament at Westminster, rendered in soft, pastel hues. Positioned slightly in front of the iconic clock tower (Big Ben), a single, empty chair is prominently displayed. Drapped over the chair is a dark navy blue coat, subtly alluding to the gravity of the situation. A shaft of light, emanating from the top left corner of the image, illuminates the chair, contrasting with the otherwise gentle, muted tones of the scene. To the right of the chair, near the edge of the frame, a quill pen rests horizontally on a desk, with a single sheet of parchment paper beside it, symbolizing resignation. The color palette should be dominated by pastel blues, creams, and grays, with small accents of deep red in the parliamentary banners, subtly reflecting the colors of the UK flag. The overall composition should evoke a sense of quiet reflection and the solemnity of the democratic process. The background should feature a soft, blurred rendering of the River Thames and the London skyline, maintaining focus on the central elements. The image must be free of text and should avoid any cartoonish or overly abstract elements, focusing instead on a realistic, watercolor aesthetic.
