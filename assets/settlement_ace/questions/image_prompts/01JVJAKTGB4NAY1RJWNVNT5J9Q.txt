A watercolor illustration in a realistic style, ratio 16:9, depicting the Houses of Parliament in London. The scene is bathed in a soft, pastel-colored light, primarily blues, reds, and whites reminiscent of the Union Jack. Focus is on the iconic clock tower, Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben), but instead of a clock face, it features an empty space. The absence symbolizes the lack of a written constitution. Around the base of the Houses of Parliament, figures representing diverse facets of British society are depicted engaged in everyday activities. Some are conversing, others are reading newspapers, and a few are simply strolling, all seemingly unconstrained and free-flowing, emphasizing the uncodified nature of the British constitution. The River Thames flows gently in the foreground, reflecting the pastel sky, adding to the sense of fluidity and lack of rigid structure. The overall composition should convey a sense of history and tradition coupled with adaptability and flexibility. The hand-drawn style should add a touch of classic British artistry, while the pastel color palette keeps the tone light and approachable.
