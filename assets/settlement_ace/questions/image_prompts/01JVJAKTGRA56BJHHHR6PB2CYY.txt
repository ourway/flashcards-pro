A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a quintessential English countryside scene, bathed in the soft, diffused light of a late summer afternoon. The scene centers around a classic cricket match in progress on a lush green field. Players in traditional white cricket uniforms are actively engaged in the game; one batsman is poised to strike, while fielders are strategically positioned. In the foreground, slightly offset from the main action, a neatly arranged picnic blanket displays a china tea set, complete with a teapot, cups, saucers, and a plate of scones with clotted cream and jam. Sprigs of lavender and wildflowers are scattered around the blanket. Rolling hills define the background, dotted with grazing sheep and ancient oak trees. A quaint village with stone cottages and a church steeple is nestled in the distance, partially obscured by a gentle mist. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel hues, with greens, blues, and creams dominating, accented by the red of the cricket ball and the Union Jack subtly incorporated into the picnic blanket pattern. The overall composition should evoke a sense of tradition, tranquility, and the quintessential English summertime.
