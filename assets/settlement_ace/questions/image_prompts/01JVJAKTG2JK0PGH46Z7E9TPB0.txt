A whimsical, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a grand, slightly fantastical courthouse scene. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag but in softer tones. In the center, a stern-looking, yet kindly, badger wearing a judge's wig sits behind a high bench adorned with carved oak leaves (symbolizing wisdom and justice). Before the bench stands a confused-looking, slightly oversized adolescent squirrel, dressed in simple clothing, clearly older than a typical child but not quite a grown adult. The squirrel's posture suggests uncertainty and being in the wrong place. To the side, subtly blurred and faded into the background, are other animal characters representing the typical age range for Youth Court: a young hedgehog, a rabbit, and a dormouse, all appearing much smaller and younger than the squirrel. Above the badger-judge, a stained-glass window depicts the scales of justice, but one side is slightly tipped towards the younger animals, emphasizing the court's focus on younger cases. The courtroom's architecture is inspired by traditional British courthouse designs, with arched windows and sturdy wooden beams. The overall atmosphere is educational and slightly humorous, designed to visually highlight the age discrepancy and the fact that someone older than 17 would not typically be in Youth Court.
