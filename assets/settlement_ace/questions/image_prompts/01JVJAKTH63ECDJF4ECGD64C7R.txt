A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a panoramic view of Roman soldiers marching along a straight, newly constructed Roman road cutting through the British countryside. The landscape should be rolling green hills dotted with ancient oak trees, characteristic of the English countryside. The soldiers are clad in traditional Roman legionary armor, with red tunics and bronze helmets, carrying rectangular shields. Some soldiers should be depicted as building the road using tools and materials authentic to the Roman era. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel colors, with soft greens, blues, and earthy tones dominating the landscape. In the far distance, hint at a Roman settlement with tiled roofs and structured architecture, blending subtly into the landscape. The sky should be a soft, watercolor blue with gentle, scattered clouds. The road should appear worn and well-traveled, suggesting the passage of time. The composition should emphasize the length of the road stretching across the landscape, subtly implying the duration of the Roman presence. The image should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and the lasting impact of Roman engineering and civilization on the British landscape.
