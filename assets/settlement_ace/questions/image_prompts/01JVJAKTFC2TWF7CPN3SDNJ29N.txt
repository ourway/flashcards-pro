A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical painting. The scene depicts two central figures against a backdrop subtly suggestive of the British Isles. On the left, a distinguished gentleman, the Duke of Wellington, stands tall in his iconic Wellington boots, polished to a sheen. He is dressed in a finely detailed military uniform, complete with medals and epaulettes. His gaze is resolute, fixed towards the right side of the image. To the right, Horatio Nelson is depicted in a naval uniform, complete with an empty sleeve pinned to his jacket. He stands proudly, with a determined expression. Behind Wellington, rolling green hills rise gently, dotted with meticulously rendered sheep, evoking the English countryside. Behind Nelson, a stylized, pastel-colored seascape unfolds, with ships silhouetted on the horizon, suggesting naval battles. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag. The composition should draw the eye to the two central figures, their posture and attire clearly conveying their historical importance and military prowess. The background elements should be detailed yet soft, providing context without overshadowing the main subjects. The lighting should be soft and diffused, giving the image a timeless, classical feel. The ratio is 16:9.
