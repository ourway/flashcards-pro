A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic storybook illustrations, with a 16:9 landscape ratio. The scene depicts a stately, slightly aged, yet strong, woman (the Home Secretary) standing protectively in front of a symbolic representation of the United Kingdom. She is dressed in a navy blue suit, subtly echoing the blue of the Union Jack, and wears a small, silver badge depicting the scales of justice on her lapel. Her expression is one of calm authority and vigilance. Behind her, the UK is represented by a stylized, gently rolling green landscape dotted with iconic landmarks: a subtle outline of the Houses of Parliament, a suggestion of the White Cliffs of Dover, and rolling Scottish hills. The sky above is a soft, pastel blue with fluffy white clouds. In front of the Home Secretary, subtly layered into the scene, are symbolic representations of her responsibilities: a stylized police officer's helmet resting on a low stone wall, suggesting policing; a simplified outline of a passport, symbolizing immigration; and a locked strongbox, representing the fight against crime. These elements are presented in a non-threatening, illustrative manner. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, green, and white, creating a calming and trustworthy atmosphere. The composition should emphasize the Home Secretary's central, protective role and the security she provides to the UK. The drawing should have soft, blended colours like watercolor to give it a warm feeling.
