A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a close-up of a £2 coin. The coin should be centrally positioned within the 16:9 landscape frame. The primary colors should subtly echo the UK flag: a muted red-brown for the coin's copper-nickel center and a soft, pastel blue-grey for the nickel-brass outer ring. The coin’s design should be clearly visible, showcasing the intricate details of Britannia, her trident, and shield. The image should capture the coin's texture, with subtle variations in color and shading to indicate wear and age, giving it a realistic, tangible feel. Soft, diffused lighting should highlight the raised details and create gentle shadows, enhancing the coin’s three-dimensionality within the 2D medium. The background should be a very light, almost ethereal, wash of pastel blue, subtly suggesting the coin is floating or presented against a clean, uncluttered backdrop. The overall effect should be one of understated elegance and clarity, emphasizing the coin as a symbol of British currency and value. Avoid any cartoonish or abstract elements; the focus should be on realistic representation and artistic detail.
