A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Hadrian's Wall stretching across a rolling, green landscape under a cloudy sky in northern England. The wall, constructed from light grey stone, appears sturdy and imposing, with turrets placed at regular intervals. On the northern side of the wall, the landscape transitions into a wilder, more rugged terrain of heather-covered hills and dense forests. Emerging from the forest are figures representing the Picts: warriors adorned with intricate, swirling blue woad tattoos covering their bodies. They are clad in simple, earthy-toned clothing, some carrying spears and shields. Their expressions are fierce and determined, but they are clearly being held back by the wall. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, greens, and browns, with the blue of the Picts' tattoos subtly echoing the blue in the cloudy sky. The composition is focused on the wall as a central barrier, with the Picts positioned on one side and a sense of peaceful, cultivated land on the other. The overall feeling is one of historical significance and a clear division between two distinct cultures. The illustration should evoke a sense of the past, emphasizing the wall's role as a defensive structure and the cultural differences between the Romans and the Picts. The scene should be viewed from a slight aerial perspective to emphasize the scale of the wall and the landscape around it.
