A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a Hogmanay celebration in a Scottish town square on New Year's Eve. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly referencing the UK flag. The scene is set at night, with a dark blue sky filled with softly glowing stars. In the center of the image, a large bonfire blazes, casting warm light on the surrounding crowd. People, dressed in traditional Scottish attire (kilts, tartan scarves), are gathered around the fire, some playing bagpipes and others dancing a lively ceilidh. A group of children are shown swinging fireballs safely at a distance, their faces lit with excitement and festive cheer. In the background, stone buildings with glowing windows line the square, suggesting a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Wisps of smoke rise from the bonfire, curling into the night sky. The overall composition should convey a sense of warmth, community, and the joyous spirit of Hogmanay. The art style should emphasize detailed rendering of the people's faces and clothing, as well as the texture of the stone buildings and the flickering flames.
