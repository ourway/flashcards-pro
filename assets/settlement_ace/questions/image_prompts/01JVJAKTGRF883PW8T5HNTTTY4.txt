A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a stylized yet fierce battle scene. The composition is centered on two prominent heraldic roses: a pristine white rose on the left and a deep crimson red rose on the right. These roses are not merely floral depictions but are intricately designed with elements of heraldry, suggesting banners or emblems of warring factions. The white rose emanates a cool, ethereal light, while the red rose glows with a warm, fiery intensity. The background features a blurred tableau of medieval warfare, with knights in shining armor clashing amidst a misty battlefield. The color palette is dominated by pastel shades, with soft blues and grays creating a somber atmosphere, punctuated by the vibrant reds and whites of the roses. The overall impression is one of historical drama and regal conflict, symbolizing the two houses locked in the Wars of the Roses. The image should evoke a sense of history and conflict, with the roses being the central, symbolic representation of the warring houses. The details in the petals and leaves of the roses should be meticulously rendered, giving them a lifelike yet symbolic quality. The overall style should be reminiscent of classic heraldic art, with a touch of romanticism in the soft watercolor textures and lighting.
