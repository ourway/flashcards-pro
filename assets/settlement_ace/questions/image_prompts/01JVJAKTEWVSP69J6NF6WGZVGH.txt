A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a pastel color palette, depicting a symbolic representation of the 1957 formation of the European Economic Community (EEC) without the United Kingdom. The central focus is a round table made of light oak, around which six chairs are placed, each draped with a national flag representing the original EEC member states: Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg. The flags are designed in pastel colours to convey a sense of calm and collaboration. A single empty chair stands slightly apart from the table, draped with a faded, muted grey version of the Union Jack, symbolizing the UK's initial absence. The table itself rests on a floor tiled with a mosaic of European maps, each tile depicting a different region. Soft, diffused light emanates from an unseen window, casting gentle shadows that enhance the depth and texture of the watercolor rendering. The background is a subtly textured wall, painted in a very light cream colour, providing a neutral backdrop that allows the table and chairs to stand out. The overall mood is one of historical significance and understated elegance, with a clear emphasis on the UK's initial non-participation in the EEC.
