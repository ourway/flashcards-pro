A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic British parliamentary art. The scene depicts the interior of the Houses of Parliament, specifically focusing on the speaker's chair and the benches where Members of Parliament are seated, all rendered in pastel colors. The overall color palette should subtly evoke the colors of the UK flag. Instead of depicting actual MPs, small, stylized quill pens are shown actively writing on scrolls of parchment, each pen diligently recording the proceedings. The pens are arranged to mimic the seating arrangement of the parliament. Emanating from the speaker's chair is a soft, golden light, symbolizing the authority and importance of the spoken word within the chamber. The background is a slightly blurred depiction of the architectural details of the Parliament building, emphasizing the gravitas and historical significance of the location. The composition centers on the pens actively writing, drawing the eye to the act of recording and documenting. The overall impression should be one of meticulous record-keeping, historical importance, and the weight of parliamentary proceedings. The image ratio is 16:9, with the main subject matter concentrated in the center. There should be no people, numbers or text in the image.
