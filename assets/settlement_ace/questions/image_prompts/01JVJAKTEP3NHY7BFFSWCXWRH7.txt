A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration depicting a panoramic view of Snowdonia National Park in Wales, rendered in a realistic style with a pastel color palette. The prominent feature is the majestic, snow-capped peak of Mount Snowdon, centrally positioned within the 16:9 landscape frame. The foreground showcases the rugged, green valleys and hiking trails characteristic of the park, dotted with small, traditional Welsh stone cottages with slate roofs. A winding river cuts through the valley floor, reflecting the soft sunlight. A lone hiker, clad in outdoor gear, is depicted ascending a trail, symbolizing exploration and the park's accessibility. In the background, rolling hills fade into a soft, hazy blue, suggesting the vastness of the park. The overall composition should evoke a sense of tranquility and natural beauty, emphasizing the unique landscape of Wales. The colour palette should be dominated by pastel shades of green, blue, grey and white with a hint of red in the Welsh flag flying atop one of the cottages, subtly reinforcing the park's location within Wales. The sky is a soft, watercolour wash of pale blue and white.
