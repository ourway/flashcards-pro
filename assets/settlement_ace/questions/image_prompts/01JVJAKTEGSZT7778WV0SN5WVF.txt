A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting three distinct portraits arranged side-by-side, each representing Seamus Heaney, Sir William Golding, and Harold Pinter. The background is a muted, pastel blue, reminiscent of a serene sky. Each figure is rendered with careful attention to detail, capturing their likeness and distinctive features. Above each portrait, a radiant, golden Nobel Prize medal is subtly suspended, connected by thin, almost invisible threads, creating a visual link between the individuals and their shared achievement. The medals should be depicted with intricate detailing, showcasing the embossed imagery and reflective surfaces. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, with the three portraits forming a central focal point within the 16:9 aspect ratio. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag while maintaining a gentle and scholarly ambiance. The intention is to convey a sense of literary prestige and shared recognition in the field of literature, fostering a memorable visual association with the Nobel Prize.
