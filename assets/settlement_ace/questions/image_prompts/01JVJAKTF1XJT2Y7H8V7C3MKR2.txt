A hand-drawn, 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a vintage political cartoon, depicting the Houses of Parliament at Westminster. The image ratio is 16:9, landscape orientation. Focus the main subject and idea mainly in the center of the image. The Houses of Parliament are subtly divided into two sides, mirroring the opposing sides in a debate. On one side, bathed in a slightly brighter, pastel blue light, stands a lion, the national animal of England, representing the leading party. It has a regal, confident pose. On the opposite side, in a slightly darker, pastel red hue, stands a bulldog, symbolizing the Opposition. The bulldog is depicted as alert and watchful, ready to pounce. A stylized tug-of-war rope extends between the lion and the bulldog, symbolizing the constant political struggle. The background features a soft, watercolour wash of pastel colours, primarily blues, reds, and whites, echoing the colours of the Union Jack. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, with the central tug-of-war providing a clear focal point. The art style should evoke a sense of historical significance and political discourse, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements. The lighting should be soft and diffused, highlighting the details of the animals and the architectural features of the Houses of Parliament. The image should be educational and visually memorable, reinforcing the concept of the Opposition as the second-largest party ready to challenge the leading party.
