A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a stylized scene of a football stadium at dusk. The stadium lights are softly illuminated, casting a warm glow on the green field. Dominating the center of the image is a silhouette of a confident, determined-looking football captain, reminiscent of Bobby Moore, raising the World Cup trophy high above his head. His figure is slightly transparent, allowing a subtle view of the cheering crowd behind him. The crowd is waving stylized British flags, colored in muted pastel shades of red, white, and blue. The sky transitions from a light pastel blue at the horizon to a soft lavender higher up, mirroring the colors of the UK flag. In the foreground, a stylized football with subtle stitching details rests peacefully on the grass. The overall composition is balanced and centered, with a focus on the captain and the trophy, creating a sense of triumph and national pride. The use of watercolor textures and soft lighting evokes a nostalgic and historical atmosphere, reminiscent of the 1966 World Cup victory. The scene should be framed as if viewed from a low angle, emphasizing the grandeur of the moment and the importance of the captain.
