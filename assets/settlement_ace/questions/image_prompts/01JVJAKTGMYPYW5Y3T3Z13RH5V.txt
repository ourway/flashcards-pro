A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style (16:9 ratio). The central focus is a suffragette rally in London, circa 1928. The scene is set against the backdrop of the Houses of Parliament, subtly depicted in muted pastel blues and grays. In the foreground, a diverse group of women, ranging in age from early twenties to middle-aged, are holding banners with symbolic imagery (but no text). The banners feature stylized representations of scales of justice, balanced equally on both sides. The women are dressed in clothing typical of the late 1920s, with cloche hats and flapper-style dresses in pastel pinks, blues, and greens. Their faces are determined and hopeful. Interspersed among the women are a few younger men, also holding similar banners, signifying the unified front for equal rights. Sunlight filters through the scene, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the faces of the participants. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues, with occasional pops of red (reminiscent of the British flag) in the ribbons and accessories worn by some of the suffragettes. The composition aims to evoke a sense of historical accuracy and the spirit of progress and equality. The art style should be realistic and detailed, capturing the emotions and atmosphere of the era.
