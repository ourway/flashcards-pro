A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic, watercolor style depicting the climactic battle between the English fleet and the Spanish Armada in 1588. The composition should be centered, focusing on the chaotic yet strategic clash of ships amidst a stormy sea. English ships, smaller and more agile, are shown maneuvering expertly around the larger, more imposing Spanish galleons. The English ships bear the St. George's Cross flag (a red cross on a white field), while the Spanish ships display the flag of Spain, (a red and yellow flag). The sea is rendered in deep blues and turbulent greys, reflecting the harsh weather conditions. Cannon fire erupts from both sides, with puffs of smoke adding to the intensity of the scene. The sky above is a dramatic blend of dark, stormy clouds contrasted by a break where golden sunlight pierces through, illuminating a section of the English fleet. The overall color palette should be reminiscent of the UK flag (red, white, and blue), with accents of gold to highlight the grandeur of the ships and the dramatic lighting. The image should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and the strategic brilliance of the English navy, capturing a pivotal moment in British history. The hand-drawn style should lend a sense of authenticity and artistic flair, enhancing the educational value of the image.
