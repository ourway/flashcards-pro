A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Tower of London. The artwork should focus on the central White Tower, rendered with accurate architectural details, including its Romanesque windows and imposing stone walls. The tower should appear sturdy and historically authentic, set against a backdrop of a serene, pastel-blue sky. Inside the White Tower, barely visible through the windows, are subtle glimmers of gold and precious stones, hinting at the presence of the Crown Jewels. The foreground features a meticulously rendered, stylized representation of a treasure chest, partially open, with light emanating from within, reflecting on the tower, suggesting a precious secret. The treasure chest is subtly integrated into the landscape, almost as if it's part of the Tower's foundation, symbolizing the safekeeping of the jewels. Colors are predominantly pastel, with the tower rendered in soft greys and beiges, the sky in light blue, and the treasure chest in warm gold tones. The overall composition should be balanced and visually appealing, designed to evoke a sense of history, security, and the importance of the Crown Jewels' location. The image ratio is 16:9, with the Tower of London and the treasure chest occupying the central area. The scene should be peaceful and inviting, avoiding any harsh or dramatic elements.
