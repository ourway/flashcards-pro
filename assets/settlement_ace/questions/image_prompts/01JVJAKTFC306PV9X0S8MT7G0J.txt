A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a symbolic representation of the Reformation and the rise of Protestantism. The image, in a 16:9 landscape format, centres on a sturdy oak tree, its roots deeply embedded in British soil. The tree's trunk is scarred with the image of a cross being 'reformed' to a new cross with a dove above it, representing the Holy Spirit in Protestant theology. The left side of the tree is shrouded in shadow, with faded, gothic architectural elements barely visible, symbolizing the pre-Reformation Catholic Church. The shadow has a deep blue hue. The right side of the tree is bathed in warm, pastel sunlight, highlighting vibrant green leaves and branches reaching towards the sky, symbolizing the growth and spread of Protestantism. Scattered at the base of the tree are fallen leaves, coloured in shades of red and white, reminiscent of the UK flag, representing the traditions that were questioned during the Reformation. A quill and open book rest near the tree's base, signifying the importance of scripture and individual interpretation within Protestant faiths. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel shades, with pops of red, white, and blue subtly integrated, creating a visually appealing and memorable scene. The background features a gently rolling British landscape, with hints of rolling hills and fields in the distance. The sky transitions from dark blue on the left to light blue on the right, mirroring the shift from pre-Reformation to post-Reformation religious landscape.
