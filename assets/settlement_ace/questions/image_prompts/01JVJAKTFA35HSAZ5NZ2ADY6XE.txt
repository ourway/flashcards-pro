A detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a sprawling, verdant European landscape under a pastel blue sky. In the center, a sturdy, ancient oak tree, representing the Council of Europe, stands tall and independent. Its roots delve deep into the earth, symbolizing its broad reach across the continent. The branches extend outwards, bearing leaves in shades of green, each leaf subtly shaped like a human hand, representing the Council's focus on human rights. Around the oak tree, a winding, well-maintained stone wall encloses a smaller, manicured garden, symbolizing the European Union. The garden is filled with neatly arranged flower beds in red, white, and blue â€“ the colors of the UK flag, but also representative of other EU nations. A clear, wide path separates the oak tree from the walled garden, emphasizing their distinctness and separation. The path is bathed in soft sunlight. A gentle breeze rustles the leaves of the oak, conveying a sense of freedom and expansive reach, in contrast to the more confined and structured nature of the EU garden. The overall color palette should be pastel, with muted shades of green, blue, red, and white, creating a calming and educational atmosphere. There are no visible signs or text in the image.
