A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Sir Chris Hoy, a powerfully built cyclist with a determined expression, intensely focused on a velodrome track. He is wearing a streamlined cycling suit in predominantly navy blue with subtle red and white accents, echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The velodrome track should be rendered in warm, earthy tones of brown and red, creating a sense of speed and motion. Behind him, blurred depictions of cheering crowds add to the dynamic atmosphere. In the far background, subtly incorporate stylized thistle flowers, a national symbol of Scotland, to highlight his Scottish heritage. The overall composition should be balanced, with Hoy centrally positioned and the background providing context without overwhelming the main subject. The color palette should be a blend of pastel shades, creating a visually appealing and memorable image. The sky above the velodrome is a soft, muted blue. The lighting should be bright and focused on Hoy, emphasizing his athleticism and determination. The image should evoke a sense of speed, competition, and Scottish pride, subtly reminding the viewer of his accomplishments as a Scottish cyclist.
