A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a split composition, divided vertically. On the left side, depict a "Justice of the Peace Court." Illustrate a serene, balanced scale of justice, gently tilted towards a scene of community harmony: neighbors helping each other, children playing safely in a park, and a local market bustling with friendly vendors. The colors here should be soft pastels, emphasizing peace and order. On the right side, represent a "Magistrates' Court." Show a wooden gavel resting on a stack of law books, with a magnifying glass nearby, subtly highlighting the detailed examination of minor issues. Behind the gavel, depict a stylized silhouette of ordinary citizens resolving small disputes, such as a disagreement over a garden fence or a minor traffic incident. The colors on this side should incorporate the red and blue of the UK flag, subdued and muted to convey a sense of authority and legal process. The background is a wash of light grey, symbolizing impartiality. The overall style should be realistic and detailed, avoiding cartoonish elements, with a focus on clear, easily recognizable imagery that conveys the essence of minor legal proceedings and the importance of community resolution. The composition emphasizes the connection between justice, the law, and the everyday lives of citizens.
