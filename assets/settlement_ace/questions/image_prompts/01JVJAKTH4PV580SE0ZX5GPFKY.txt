A vibrant, hand-drawn, 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of watercolor paintings, showcasing David Hockney during the 1960s pop art movement. The central focus is Hockney, depicted in his signature round glasses and a colorful, patterned shirt characteristic of the era. He stands in front of a stylized swimming pool scene, echoing his famous "A Bigger Splash" painting. The pool water shimmers with varying shades of light blue and turquoise, reflecting the clear Californian sky above. On one side of the pool, a minimalist, angular building with large glass windows hints at the architectural aesthetic of the time. Scattered around the scene are oversized, stylized everyday objects: a giant comb, an enormous tube of toothpaste, and a colossal, brightly colored telephone, all rendered in bold, pastel colors (primarily blues, reds, and whites, subtly referencing the UK flag). These objects are arranged to create a sense of depth and perspective, guiding the eye through the composition. The background features a hazy, sun-drenched landscape with palm trees silhouetted against a warm, pastel-colored sky, subtly alluding to Hockney's time in Los Angeles. The overall composition should evoke a sense of vibrant energy, capturing the essence of the 1960s pop art movement and Hockney's pivotal role within it. The light should be soft and diffused, creating a nostalgic and dreamlike atmosphere. The image should be strictly 2D, with no elements of 3D rendering.
