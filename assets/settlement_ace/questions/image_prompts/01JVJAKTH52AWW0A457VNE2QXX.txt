A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting a symbolic bridge spanning a gentle, pastel-colored English countryside. The bridge's foundation is composed of two distinct yet interconnected pillars. The left pillar is adorned with oak leaves, subtly representing the Conservative party's traditional symbolism. The oak leaves are rendered in muted greens and browns, with delicate details highlighting their textures. The right pillar is decorated with a stylized image of a 'Liberty Bell', rendered in soft yellows and blues, symbolizing the Liberal Democrats and their focus on individual freedoms. The bridge itself is constructed of light grey stone, suggesting unity and stability. Above the bridge, two doves, one coloured sky blue and the other a pastel yellow, are flying in unison towards a rising sun, symbolizing a new dawn and cooperation. The landscape below features rolling green hills dotted with quintessential English cottages with red-tiled roofs, all rendered in soft, pastel hues to create a calming and harmonious visual. The sky is a blend of pale blues and pinks, suggesting optimism and hope. The overall composition should evoke a sense of collaboration, stability, and the coming together of different ideologies for a common purpose. The style should be realistic yet gentle, avoiding harsh lines or overly saturated colors, to create a memorable and educational image.
