A hand-drawn, realistic 2D illustration in a watercolor style, depicting a serene scene inside a grand, classically designed room reminiscent of the House of Lords. The Queen, portrayed with dignity and grace, is seated at a large, ornate table. She is depicted in a light blue dress. Standing respectfully to her side is the Prime Minister, subtly gesturing towards a group of diverse, distinguished individuals who represent potential Life Peers. These individuals are arranged in a semi-circle, each possessing unique characteristics and attire suggestive of their varied fields of expertise and life experiences. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades of blue, red, and white, subtly evoking the colors of the Union Jack. The overall composition should emphasize the Queen's central role, balanced by the Prime Minister's advisory position and the diverse expertise of the potential Life Peers. The background should feature subtle architectural details that hint at the historical significance of the location, such as arched windows with soft, natural light streaming in, and perhaps a glimpse of a tapestry depicting a historical scene. The light should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of solemnity and respect. The style should be realistic and detailed, capturing the nuances of each character's expression and attire.
