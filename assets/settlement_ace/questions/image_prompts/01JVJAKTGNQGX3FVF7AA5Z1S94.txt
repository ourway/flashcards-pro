A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting the Union Jack flag of the United Kingdom. The artwork should showcase the flag unfurled gently, as if caught in a light breeze. The primary focus is on the distinct crosses that comprise the flag. St. George's Cross (England), a bold red cross on a white field, lies at the heart of the design. Overlaid upon this are the white diagonal St. Andrew's Cross (Scotland) on a blue field and the red diagonal St. Patrick's Cross (Ireland) on a white field. The colors should be vibrant and true to the flag's traditional palette of red, white, and blue. The overall composition should emphasize the layered nature of the crosses, highlighting their individual shapes and colors while demonstrating their harmonious union within the flag. The background should be kept minimal, perhaps a soft, gradient sky in pastel blues and whites to avoid detracting from the main subject. The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and aiming for an educational and informative representation of the Union Jack. Subtle watercolor textures should add depth and visual interest, evoking a sense of tradition and history.
