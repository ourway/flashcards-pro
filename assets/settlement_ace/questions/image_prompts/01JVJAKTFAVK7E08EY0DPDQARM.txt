A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style (not cartoonish or abstract), ratio 16:9. The scene depicts a grand, sunlit concert hall in the UK, bathed in a warm, pastel light, with a focus on the central stage. An orchestra, rendered with precise detail, is playing the National Anthem. The conductor stands prominently, his baton raised mid-air, capturing the crescendo of the music. Instead of the Queen being present in the royal box, which is empty, a symbolic representation of the United Kingdom is subtly woven into the scene. This includes a stylized, stained-glass window behind the orchestra featuring iconic British symbols: a Tudor rose, a Scottish thistle, a Welsh daffodil, and an Irish shamrock, all radiating a soft, patriotic glow. Above the orchestra, spectral, translucent figures representing diverse groups of people – families, workers, students – are subtly visible, suggesting the spirit and unity of the nation. The overall color palette leans towards soft blues, reds, and creams, reminiscent of the UK flag but in a muted, pastel tone. The hall itself is adorned with subtle architectural details typical of British concert halls, such as ornate plasterwork and velvet drapes, rendered with meticulous care. The lighting is key, emphasizing the warmth and celebratory atmosphere of the music, subtly conveying that the National Anthem is a symbol of the nation as a whole, not solely dependent on the monarch's presence.
