A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant scene within the Scottish Parliament. The composition is centered, adhering to a 16:9 landscape ratio. Imagine the interior of the parliament chamber, bathed in soft, natural light filtering through large arched windows. Dominating the center is a stylized representation of the Scottish Saltire (St. Andrew's Cross) crafted entirely from individual, uniquely drawn wildflowers native to Scotland, such as heather, bluebells, and thistles. The flowers are densely packed, creating the white cross against a backdrop of a muted, pastel blue representing the sky. Each flower is subtly different, symbolizing the individual MSPs. Arranged around the floral Saltire are 129 distinct antique-style wooden chairs, each slightly different in design, suggesting the diversity of the constituencies represented. The chairs are empty, focusing attention on the symbolic Saltire. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, purples, and greens, with subtle hints of the red from the UK flag appearing in a few of the flower petals. The style should evoke a sense of historical importance and natural beauty, reflecting Scotland's rich heritage. The image should be detailed enough to be visually engaging and memorable but not overwhelming. The background should feature subtle architectural details of the Scottish Parliament building, rendered in soft, muted tones to avoid distracting from the central floral arrangement. The overall feel should be serene, dignified, and representative of the democratic process.
