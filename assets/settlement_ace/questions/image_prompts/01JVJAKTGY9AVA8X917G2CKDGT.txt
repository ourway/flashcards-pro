A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the British Houses of Parliament bathed in the warm, golden light of a late summer afternoon. The primary colors used are pastel shades of blue and red, reminiscent of the Union Jack. In the foreground, slightly blurred to indicate its secondary importance, a scroll representing the "Home Rule" agreement for Ireland rests partially unrolled on a stone bench. Directly behind the Houses of Parliament, dominating the skyline, a swirling vortex of dark, ominous storm clouds is gathering. These clouds are rendered in deep grays, blacks, and muted reds, suggesting the chaotic and destructive nature of war. Silhouetted within the storm clouds are symbolic representations of World War I: biplanes locked in aerial combat, stylized battleships on a stormy sea, and marching soldiers with bayonets fixed. The overall composition should convey a sense of impending disruption and postponement, with the looming war overshadowing the promise of Home Rule. The style aims for historical accuracy and a serious tone. The image should evoke a sense of foreboding and the understanding that a global conflict would inevitably take precedence over domestic political matters.
