A hand-drawn, 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a courtroom scene with a judge presiding. The judge, wearing a traditional wig and gown, is positioned centrally. To the judge's left, visualize a large, symbolic set of scales, perfectly balanced. On one side of the scales, subtly incorporate elements representing "public bodies" â€“ perhaps miniature buildings or symbols of institutions. On the other side, depict a single, slightly larger, but not overwhelming, symbolic figure representing an individual. To the judge's right, show two distinct visual outcomes. The first outcome is represented by a hand gently adjusting the position of the scales, symbolizing the act of ordering a change in practices. The second outcome is a cascade of golden coins flowing towards the individual on the scales, representing the judge ordering compensation. The background should be a muted, pastel blue, reminiscent of the UK flag's blue, with subtle architectural details suggesting a classic British courthouse. The colours used should be predominantly in a pastel palette, with the gold coins providing a warm contrast. The overall composition should be balanced and serene, conveying fairness and justice.
