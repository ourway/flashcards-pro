A serene, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a pristine Welsh lake nestled amongst rolling green hills. The sky above is a soft, pastel blue, mirroring the water below. Dominating the center of the frame is a majestic white swan, its feathers meticulously detailed to capture their texture and form. The swan glides gracefully across the lake's surface, leaving gentle ripples in its wake. In the distance, partially obscured by a light mist, are the characteristic slate-roofed cottages of a small Welsh village. The hills surrounding the lake are dotted with grazing sheep, further emphasizing the rural Welsh landscape. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, green, and white, evoking a sense of tranquility and natural beauty. The composition is balanced and harmonious, drawing the viewer's eye to the swan as the central focal point, subtly linking its presence to the Welsh setting. The style should evoke classic nature illustrations found in old encyclopedias, and the water should look calm and still. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a peaceful and idyllic scene.
