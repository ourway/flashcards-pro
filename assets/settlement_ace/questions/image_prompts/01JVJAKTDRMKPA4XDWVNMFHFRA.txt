A whimsical, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a vibrant, pastel-coloured birthday cake adorned with sixteen lit candles. The cake is tiered and decorated with delicate sugar flowers in shades of blue, red, and white, reminiscent of the Union Jack. A cascade of confetti, also in pastel red, white, and blue, rains down around the cake. A pair of hands, rendered in soft, realistic detail, are reaching towards the cake, one poised to blow out the candles. The background features a soft, blurred bokeh effect of twinkling lights, creating a celebratory and dreamlike atmosphere. Positioned slightly behind the cake is a subtly depicted lottery ticket, its design elegant and understated, barely visible. This suggests the possibility of participation, hinting at the correct answer. The overall art style should evoke a sense of youthful joy and aspiration, with a colour palette leaning towards soft pastels punctuated by the symbolic red, white, and blue. The composition should be balanced and inviting, drawing the viewer's eye to the central image of the cake and the symbolic age of sixteen.
