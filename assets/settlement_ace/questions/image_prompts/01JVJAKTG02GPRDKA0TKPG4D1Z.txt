A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of a botanical illustration, depicting a field of daffodils in full bloom under a bright, slightly overcast sky. The field gently slopes towards the viewer, creating a sense of depth. The daffodils are painted in varying shades of yellow, from pale lemon to deep golden hues, with delicate details highlighting their trumpet-shaped coronas and slender green stems. Interspersed among the daffodils are subtle hints of green grass and wildflowers, painted in soft pastel shades. In the background, rolling hills of the Welsh countryside fade into a misty blue horizon. Above the field, a flock of swallows gracefully soar through the air. In the foreground, a single daffodil is prominently displayed, subtly larger and more detailed than the others, its petals catching the light. The composition should evoke a sense of tranquility and natural beauty, emphasizing the daffodil's association with the Welsh landscape and springtime celebrations. The color palette should predominantly feature yellows, greens, and blues, with touches of white to create highlights and a sense of airy lightness.
