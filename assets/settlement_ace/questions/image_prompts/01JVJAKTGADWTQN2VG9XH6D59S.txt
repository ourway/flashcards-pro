A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a panoramic view of London. The image, formatted in a 16:9 landscape ratio with the main subject centered, showcases the River Thames flowing horizontally across the frame. On the northern bank, the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben stand prominently, their neo-Gothic architecture rendered with careful attention to detail. The clock face of Big Ben displays the correct time of 12:00, subtly symbolizing midday. Further east, the Tower of London is visible, its historic stone walls and towers accurately depicted. In the background, the London Eye provides a modern contrast, its capsules rendered with translucent detail. A classic red double-decker bus navigates a street near the riverbank, adding a touch of quintessential British life. The sky above is a soft gradient of pastel blues and pinks, reminiscent of a clear summer day. The overall color palette leans towards the red, white, and blue of the UK flag, with muted tones that evoke a sense of history and grandeur. The composition should emphasize the density and vibrancy of London while maintaining a clean, educational aesthetic, devoid of any text. The light source is positioned from the upper left, casting soft shadows that enhance the depth and realism of the scene.
