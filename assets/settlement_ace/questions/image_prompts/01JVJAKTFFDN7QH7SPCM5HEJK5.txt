A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic religious iconography. The scene is divided into two distinct but interconnected halves, unified by a central overarching element. Above the entire composition floats a stylized Celtic cross, rendered in soft, pastel blues and whites, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag. On the left side of the image, a representation of the Roman Forum is depicted, with iconic columns and arches bathed in a warm, golden light. Above the Forum, a gentle, ethereal light emanates, forming a halo-like effect. To the right side of the image, a serene river scene unfolds. A figure dressed in white robes stands waist-deep in the clear water, gently pouring water over the head of another figure. The riverbank is lined with lush green foliage, and a dove, symbolizing peace, flies overhead. The overall color palette should consist of soft pastel shades, with blues, whites, and greens predominating, creating a calming and reverent atmosphere. The sky should be a pale blue, with hints of watercolor washes creating a sense of depth and atmosphere. The composition should emphasize the connection between these two distinct groups within Christianity, highlighting both their historical roots and their shared faith.
