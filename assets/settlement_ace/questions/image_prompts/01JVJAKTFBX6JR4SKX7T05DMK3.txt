A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the Palace of Westminster with the iconic Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) prominently featured. The scene is set during a slightly overcast day, casting a soft, diffused light across the scene. The Palace's neo-Gothic architecture is rendered with precise detail, showcasing its intricate stonework, pointed arches, and numerous windows. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, grays, and whites, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag without being overtly patriotic. The River Thames flows gently in the foreground, reflecting the Palace's image with slight ripples disturbing the reflection. A few traditional black London taxis are visible on the bridge in the background, adding to the British ambiance. The overall composition should emphasize the grandeur and historical significance of the Palace, conveying a sense of authority and tradition. The painting should evoke a sense of calm and contemplation, inviting the viewer to reflect on the importance of the decisions made within its walls. The image ratio is 16:9, with the Palace of Westminster centered, allowing for a balanced and visually appealing composition. The sky should be a muted gray-blue, suggesting a typical London day. Small, barely visible details like the Royal Standard flag flying atop Victoria Tower and subtle variations in the stonework's color should enhance the realism and visual interest. The style should avoid cartoonish or abstract elements, maintaining a focus on accurate representation and artistic quality.
