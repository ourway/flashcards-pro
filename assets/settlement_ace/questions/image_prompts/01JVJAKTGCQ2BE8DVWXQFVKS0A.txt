A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Battle of Hastings. The image, in a 16:9 landscape format, centers on the clash between Norman and Saxon armies. Dominating the foreground is William the Conqueror on horseback, clad in shining armour, raising his sword, his expression determined yet regal. His banner, bearing a stylized Norman emblem (perhaps a golden lion), flutters dramatically in the wind. Below him, Norman soldiers, with shields and spears, surge forward.

Opposing them are the Saxon forces, a wall of shields and axes, led by King Harold, who is falling to the ground, with an arrow piercing his eye. The background features the rolling hills of the Sussex countryside, rendered in soft greens and browns. A faint mist hangs in the air, adding a sense of drama and historical weight. The sky is a turbulent mix of blues and greys, hinting at the stormy events unfolding. The colour palette leans towards the blues and reds of the Union Jack, subtly woven into the soldiers' attire and the landscape, with pastel shades used to soften the overall impact. The composition emphasizes the chaos and intensity of the battle, while the realistic style ensures historical accuracy and educational value, creating a memorable visual anchor for the year 1066 and the Norman invasion.
