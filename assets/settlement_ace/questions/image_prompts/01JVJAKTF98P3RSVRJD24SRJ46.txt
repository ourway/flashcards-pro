A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a symbolic representation of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee in 2012. The central focus is a stylized oak tree, its trunk robust and detailed with sixty clearly visible rings, signifying each year of Queen Elizabeth II's reign. The rings are colored in a gradient, starting with a light pastel blue at the center and gradually darkening to a royal blue towards the outer rings. Around the base of the tree, depict a vibrant, yet orderly, garden of sixty blooming roses, each flower meticulously rendered in various shades of red and white, echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The roses are arranged in a circular pattern, further emphasizing the idea of completed years. Above the tree, six doves, each representing a decade, are flying in a circular formation, their wings outstretched, symbolizing peace and longevity. The background features a soft, pastel-colored sky, transitioning from a pale blue at the top to a gentle rose color near the horizon. The overall composition should evoke a sense of regal celebration, historical significance, and the enduring strength and beauty of the monarchy, all while remaining distinctly British through the color palette and symbolic elements. The landscape is a gentle rolling hill with lush green grass, representative of the British countryside.
