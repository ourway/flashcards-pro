A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic book illustrations. The scene centers on a dimly lit, Victorian-era study, bathed in soft, warm light from a crackling fireplace. Dominating the composition is a large, leather-bound book resting open on a mahogany desk. Perched elegantly on the open pages is a meticulously rendered magnifying glass, casting a focused beam of light on an intricate footprint illustration. The desk is cluttered with parchment scrolls, a quill pen in an inkwell, and various vials and beakers, suggesting scientific pursuits. In the background, partially obscured by shadows, is a silhouette of a deerstalker hat and a curved pipe resting on a bookshelf filled with old books. Subtle pastel colors, primarily blues, creams, and browns, evoke a sense of mystery and intellectualism. The overall composition should convey an atmosphere of investigation, deduction, and classic British literature, subtly hinting at the creator of Sherlock Holmes. the 16:9 ratio should be respected.
