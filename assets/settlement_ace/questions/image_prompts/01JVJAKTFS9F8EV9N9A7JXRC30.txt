A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting the interior of the House of Commons. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The central focus is on the Speaker's Chair, ornately carved and positioned prominently. Surrounding the chair, rendered with careful attention to detail, are rows of seated Members of Parliament (MPs). The MPs are depicted in mid-conversation, some gesturing, but all with a sense of respectful engagement. A soft, diffused light filters in from high, arched windows, illuminating the scene. Symbolic elements include gavels subtly resting on the desks of a few MPs, and the Mace, a symbol of the Speaker's authority, placed visibly on the table in front of the Speaker's Chair. Compositionally, the image should guide the viewer's eye towards the Speaker's Chair, emphasizing the collective gaze and implied decision-making process of the MPs. The overall atmosphere should convey a sense of order, debate, and the democratic process, subtly hinting at the selection of the Speaker by fellow MPs. The style should avoid cartoonish or abstract elements, maintaining a realistic and educational tone.
