A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting two distinct scenes, side-by-side, within a 16:9 landscape format. The color palette leans heavily on pastel shades of blue, red, and white, subtly echoing the UK flag. On the left side, illustrate a bustling town square scene from the 1830s. A diverse crowd of people, representing various social classes, are queuing to cast their votes. Some are holding ballot papers. The architecture is distinctly British, featuring cobblestone streets, brick buildings, and subtle Victorian-era details. The atmosphere is optimistic and celebratory, with people smiling and engaging in lively conversation. On the right side, depict a crumbling, dilapidated building, representing a "rotten borough." This building is overgrown with ivy and appears to be in a state of disrepair. A symbolic rat scurries away from the building, further emphasizing its decay. The sky above this building is slightly overcast, contrasting with the bright, sunny sky above the town square scene. A cracked, old wooden sign hangs precariously on the rotten borough, barely legible. The composition should clearly differentiate between the two scenes, yet connect them visually, suggesting the positive change brought about by the Reform Act. The overall tone should be educational and historically accurate, emphasizing the themes of democracy, fairness, and progress.
