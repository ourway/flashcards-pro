A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant rose garden bursting with fully bloomed, deep red roses. The roses are the central focus, their petals rendered with intricate detail to capture their velvety texture and rich color. The background features a subtle, misty landscape reminiscent of the English countryside, with rolling green hills fading into a soft, pastel-blue sky. Intertwined among the rose bushes are delicate, thorny vines, adding a touch of wildness and symbolizing the conflict of the era. The overall composition is centered, maintaining a 16:9 aspect ratio, with the densest concentration of roses in the middle ground. The color palette is predominantly red, with variations of crimson and burgundy for the roses, contrasted by the green foliage and the soft blue sky. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a romantic yet powerful atmosphere. The style should evoke classic botanical illustrations, emphasizing accuracy and beauty, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements. The image should convey a sense of historical significance and natural beauty, serving as a visual mnemonic for the association of "Lancaster" with "red roses" during the civil war.
