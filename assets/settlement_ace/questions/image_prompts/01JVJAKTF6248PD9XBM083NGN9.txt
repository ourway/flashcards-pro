A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style landscape depicting the majestic Snowdonia mountain range in Wales, rendered in a realistic style. The scene unfolds under a vast, pastel-blue sky, subtly brushed with strokes of white to mimic the movement of clouds. The highest peak of Snowdonia dominates the central composition, its rocky surface textured with fine lines and subtle gradations of grey, brown, and muted green to convey depth and realism. Patches of snow cling to the upper reaches of the mountain, subtly hinting at the "snowy" association. At the foot of the mountain, a serene valley stretches out, dotted with small, traditional Welsh cottages featuring slate roofs and whitewashed walls. A winding river, reflecting the sky's pastel hues, meanders through the valley, adding a sense of tranquility. The colors are predominantly pastel, with soft blues, greens, and browns, punctuated by the white of the snow and the muted reds and browns of the cottages. The overall atmosphere is one of peaceful grandeur, evoking the natural beauty and cultural heritage of Wales. The image maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio, with the mountain range being the main focal point in the center.
