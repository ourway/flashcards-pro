A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a poignant farewell scene at the edge of a verdant English meadow under a pastel dawn sky. The primary subject is a group of three medieval knights in shining, though slightly tarnished, armor. One knight, centrally positioned, is mounted on a sturdy, grey warhorse, his visor slightly raised, revealing a weary but resolute face. He extends a gloved hand towards two other knights standing on the ground. One of the ground knights, slightly older with a grey beard peeking from under his helmet, clasps the mounted knight's hand in a gesture of camaraderie and farewell. The other ground knight, younger and clean-shaven, looks on with a mix of hope and resignation. Scattered around their feet are fallen autumn leaves in shades of red, gold, and brown, subtly hinting at the passage of time and the end of an era. In the far background, barely visible through a light morning mist, are the faint silhouettes of Tudor roses blooming, symbolizing the transition to a new dynasty. The overall color palette leans towards soft pastels with touches of red and blue in the knights' surcoats, subtly reflecting the colors of the UK flag. The composition emphasizes the central farewell, capturing the moment of transition from the medieval era, with a focus on realistic details in the knights' armor, facial expressions, and the natural surroundings.
