A vividly colored, hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a stylized depiction of the Houses of Parliament, rendered in pastel shades of blue and white, reminiscent of the UK flag. Two distinct yet interconnected streams of pastel-colored water, one primarily blue and the other primarily red, flow from opposite sides of the image, converging at the base of the Houses of Parliament to form a single, larger pool of purple water. The blue stream represents one political party, the red represents another, and the purple pool symbolizes the coalition formed by them. The banks of each stream are lined with stylized, simplified versions of flora and fauna unique to the UK, such as roses (England), thistles (Scotland), daffodils (Wales), and shamrocks (Northern Ireland), all rendered in soft pastel shades. Above the Houses of Parliament, a bright, soft yellow sun shines, casting a warm glow over the scene, representing the positive outcome of cooperation and shared governance. The overall composition should convey harmony, cooperation, and the coming together of different elements to create something new and stronger, emphasizing the concept of a coalition government. The style should be realistic yet softened by the watercolor effect, making it visually appealing and easily memorable, and strictly avoid any text or numbers.
