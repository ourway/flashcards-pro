A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style (not cartoonish or abstract) depicting two distinct sailing scenes, side-by-side, on a 16:9 canvas. The left side showcases a lone sailor, representing Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, aboard a sturdy, classic sailing yacht with white sails billowing in a moderate breeze. The yacht is depicted mid-ocean, with deep blue waves and a clear, slightly overcast sky. The sailor, a weathered but determined figure in traditional sailing attire, is at the helm, looking towards the horizon with unwavering focus. The right side mirrors this scene, but with a different sailor, Sir Francis Chichester, aboard a similar yet uniquely identifiable yacht. The sea on this side is slightly rougher, with taller waves, hinting at a more challenging voyage. The color palette should predominantly feature pastel blues, creams, and whites, accented with touches of red and navy blue reminiscent of the UK flag. The composition should ensure both sailors and their respective yachts are clearly visible and equally weighted in the frame, emphasizing their individual achievements. The overall atmosphere should evoke a sense of solitary adventure, British maritime history, and the daring spirit of single-handed circumnavigation. The horizon line should be slightly off-center to create visual interest, and subtle details like seabirds in the sky and the glint of sunlight on the water should add depth and realism to the scene.
