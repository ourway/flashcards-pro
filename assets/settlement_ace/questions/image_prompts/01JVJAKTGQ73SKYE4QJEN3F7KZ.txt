A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor painting depicting Stonehenge at dawn in Wiltshire, England. The composition is centered, filling the 16:9 landscape format. The massive sarsen stones and smaller bluestones are realistically rendered with subtle variations in texture and color, reflecting the warm, golden light of the rising sun. The sky is a soft gradient of pastel pinks, blues, and oranges, transitioning from the dark blue of the pre-dawn sky. The surrounding landscape is a rolling green field, dotted with grazing sheep rendered in soft, fluffy detail. Wisps of mist cling to the ground, adding an ethereal quality to the scene. The overall style is reminiscent of a classical landscape painting, with an emphasis on light and atmosphere. The stones themselves should be weathered and aged, showing signs of their long history. Small details, such as tufts of grass growing between the stones and the subtle shadows cast by the rising sun, should be included to enhance the realism and visual interest. The color palette should be dominated by pastel shades, with hints of the UK flag colors (red, white, and blue) subtly integrated into the sky and landscape. Focus on creating a serene and timeless image that evokes a sense of mystery and wonder.
