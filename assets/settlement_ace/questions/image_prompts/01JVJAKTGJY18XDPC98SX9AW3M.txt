A watercolour-style illustration depicting a majestic, but clearly symbolic, British lion wearing a royal crown. The lion is seated regally on a throne within a grand, yet subtly stylised, depiction of the Houses of Parliament. The lion holds a sceptre lightly in its paw, but its gaze is directed not towards a commanding view, but rather towards a colourful, overflowing cornucopia of flowers, fruits, and cultural symbols representing the diverse aspects of British life â€“ a book, a musical instrument, tools representing industry, and art supplies. The cornucopia is positioned slightly in front of the lion, suggesting a focus on the well-being and richness of the nation rather than on the lion's own power. The colours should primarily be pastel shades, with muted blues, reds, and whites subtly referencing the Union Jack. The overall composition should convey a sense of tradition, history, and symbolic representation, emphasizing that the lion's role is more ceremonial and focused on the nation's prosperity than on wielding absolute power. A soft, diffused light washes over the scene, creating a gentle and reassuring atmosphere.
