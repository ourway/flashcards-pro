A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a scene set in a softly lit, arched stone doorway reminiscent of a medieval prison entrance. A single shaft of light illuminates the scene. In the center, a pair of hands, rendered in a pale skin tone, are shown reaching out. The hands are straining against the implied weight of heavy, ornate iron shackles that are beginning to crack and crumble. The background behind the hands shows an open field with green grass and a bright blue sky, symbolising freedom. Soft pastel colours dominate the scene: pale blues and creams for the stone archway, a gentle sky blue and light green for the field. The cracked shackles could be a muted iron grey with hints of rust. The overall composition is designed to evoke a sense of hope and liberation. The artistic style should resemble classical illustrations. The image should avoid any harsh lines or overly dramatic shadows, maintaining a gentle, educational aesthetic. The scene is framed within a 16:9 aspect ratio, with the key elements centered to draw the viewer's focus.
