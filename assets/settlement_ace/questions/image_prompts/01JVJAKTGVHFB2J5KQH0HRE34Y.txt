A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a serene yet poignant scene symbolizing the end of World War I in 1918. The central focus is a field of poppies, predominantly red, gently swaying in a breeze under a pastel blue sky. Interspersed among the poppies are several British army helmets, realistically rendered with subtle wear and tear, lying on the ground as if discarded. In the mid-ground, a single, weathered wooden cross stands as a memorial. The background features a soft, rolling landscape reminiscent of the English countryside, fading into a hazy horizon. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and greens, subtly evoking the colors of the UK flag without being overtly patriotic. The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting a peaceful dawn or dusk. The composition emphasizes the quiet stillness and the cessation of conflict, with the poppies serving as a powerful symbol of remembrance and the helmets representing the soldiers who fought. The style should be reminiscent of classic war art, aiming for emotional resonance and historical accuracy while maintaining a gentle, educational tone. The scene should be devoid of any text or numbers, allowing the visual elements to convey the message of the war's end in 1918.
