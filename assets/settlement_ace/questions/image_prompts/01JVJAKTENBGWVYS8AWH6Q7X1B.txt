A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic medical illustrations. The scene is set within a softly lit hospital ward of the mid-19th century, bathed in the warm glow of oil lamps. The central figure is Florence Nightingale, depicted as a compassionate and determined woman in her early forties, dressed in a simple, dark-colored dress with a white cap and apron, her hair neatly pulled back. She holds a lamp in her left hand, casting a gentle light on a patient lying in bed. The patient, an injured soldier, is depicted with a weary but hopeful expression. The background is filled with other patients in similar beds, attended by other nurses. Medical equipment of the era, such as bandages, medicine bottles, and charts, are subtly placed around the room. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades of blue, white, and cream, with touches of red in the soldier's uniform and the occasional flower arrangement, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag. The overall composition should be centered on Florence Nightingale and the patient, emphasizing the nurturing and healing aspects of her profession. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of calm and care. The illustration should evoke a feeling of respect and admiration for Florence Nightingale's pioneering work in nursing.
