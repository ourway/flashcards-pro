A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration depicting the division of England during the Civil War, rendered in a realistic style with a 16:9 landscape ratio. The composition is bisected vertically, symbolizing the stark division of the country. On the left side, illustrate a group of "Roundheads". These figures are dressed in the simple, functional clothing of the Parliamentarians, with close-cropped, bowl-shaped haircuts. Their attire features muted, earthy tones, primarily browns, grays, and deep greens. They are holding simple farming tools and some are holding bibles, representing the common people and their religious convictions. On the right side, depict the "Cavaliers". They are adorned in elaborate, flamboyant attire, featuring lace collars, feathered hats, and brightly colored jackets â€“ primarily royal blues, rich reds, and gold accents. Some are holding swords and muskets. They exude an air of aristocratic privilege and loyalty to the crown. The background on the left shows a simple English countryside with fields, cottages and a church in the far distance. The background on the right depicts an English manor house, with manicured gardens and a flag bearing a royal crest. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades, with strategic use of red, white, and blue (the colors of the UK flag) subtly incorporated into the clothing and background elements to tie the image to British identity. The sky above should be turbulent, with dark clouds gathering in the center, reflecting the conflict and turmoil of the era. The entire image should evoke a sense of historical realism and the profound societal split caused by the Civil War.
