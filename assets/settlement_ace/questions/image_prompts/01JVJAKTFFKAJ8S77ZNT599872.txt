A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting depicting a stylized map of Northern Ireland in a pastel color palette, predominantly light blues, greens, and creams. The map's coastline and geographical features are clearly defined, with subtle shading to indicate elevation. Positioned centrally on the map, precisely over the location of Belfast, is a large, ornate, antique-style bell crafted from copper, polished to a warm sheen. The bell is intricately detailed with Celtic knotwork designs etched into its surface, subtly alluding to the region's cultural heritage. The clapper of the bell is slightly ajar, as if it has just been rung. Emanating outwards from the bell are gentle, radiating sound waves, visualized as concentric circles of light blue watercolor washes that gradually fade into the background. The background itself is a soft, textured watercolor wash, reminiscent of aged parchment, providing a subtle antique feel. The overall composition should evoke a sense of history, culture, and the distinctive sound of a bell resonating from the heart of Northern Ireland, visually connecting the bell and the concept of "Belfast" as the capital. The image should be 16:9.
