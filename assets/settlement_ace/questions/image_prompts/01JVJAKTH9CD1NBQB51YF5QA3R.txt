A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a dramatic scene centered around a bonfire. The bonfire, blazing with warm reds, oranges, and yellows, dominates the center of the 16:9 landscape composition. Around the bonfire, shadowy figures in 17th-century attire are subtly visible, their expressions a mix of fear and surprise. In the foreground, partially obscured by the dancing flames, is a pile of gunpowder barrels, rendered in shades of brown and grey. One barrel is slightly ajar, revealing a glint of dark powder inside. Rising from the smoke of the bonfire is a spectral silhouette of the Houses of Parliament, depicted in muted grey tones, suggesting the intended target of the foiled plot. Dominating the sky above the scene are stylized fireworks bursting in the colours of the Union Jack: vibrant red, deep blue, and stark white. The overall colour palette leans towards a slightly muted, pastel scheme, with strategic splashes of vibrant colour to draw the eye to key elements like the fire and fireworks. The style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and dramatic tension, without being overly graphic. The illustration should capture the atmosphere of a cold November night in 1605, with the flickering firelight casting long, dancing shadows across the scene. The overall effect should be visually arresting and memorable, firmly associating the image with the event and date.
