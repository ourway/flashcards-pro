A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting Stonehenge at dawn in Wiltshire, England. The iconic stone circle is the central focus, bathed in the soft, pastel hues of the rising sun (primarily light blues, pinks, and creams). The stones themselves should be rendered with careful attention to texture and weathering, showcasing their rough, timeworn surfaces. Gently rolling green hills surround the monument, dotted with grazing sheep rendered in soft, fluffy detail. A winding, barely visible path leads towards the stones, suggesting the journey of pilgrims or visitors across centuries. The sky transitions from a deep indigo at the horizon to a pale blue overhead, with delicate watercolor washes creating a sense of atmospheric perspective. Wisps of morning mist cling to the ground, adding an ethereal quality to the scene. The overall style should evoke a sense of ancient mystery and timelessness, while maintaining a realistic and educational aesthetic. Subtle shadows cast by the stones emphasize their monumental scale and the play of light on their surfaces. The composition should be balanced and serene, drawing the viewer's eye directly to the central arrangement of Stonehenge.
