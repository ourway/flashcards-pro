A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades of red, white, and blue, subtly referencing the UK flag. The central focus is a stylized depiction of the Houses of Parliament, rendered in soft, muted blues and greys. Emanating from the Parliament building are two distinct pathways. One pathway, colored a light rose-pink, leads to a silhouette of a woman, depicted in the attire of the 1920s (flapper dress, bobbed hair). The other pathway, colored a pale blue, leads to a silhouette of a man, also in 1920s attire (suit, fedora). Both figures are depicted as vibrantly stepping forward. A calendar is subtly placed in the lower center of the image; the calendar is open to the year 1928, with the numbers rendered in a slightly bolder, sepia-toned ink. Behind the Parliament building, a faint, ominous cloud begins to gather on the horizon, hinting at the approaching Great Depression, but it should be subtle and not detract from the main subject. The overall mood should be hopeful and progressive, emphasizing the empowerment of both genders. The sky should be a blend of soft blues and whites, creating a sense of calm and optimism.
