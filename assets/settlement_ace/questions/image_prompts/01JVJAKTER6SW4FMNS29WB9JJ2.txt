A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor landscape depicting the length of the UK mainland. The artwork should be in a realistic style, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements. The composition is divided into two distinct scenes, seamlessly blended to represent the north-to-south journey. The northern part of the image showcases the rugged Scottish Highlands, complete with misty mountains, deep lochs reflecting the pastel sky, and scattered heather in full bloom. A winding, narrow road snakes through the mountains, subtly suggesting a path. The southern part transitions into the rolling green hills of southern England, dotted with quaint villages featuring thatched-roof cottages and fields of yellow rapeseed. A prominent, but not overwhelming, milestone marker is positioned at the approximate midpoint of the image, subtly etched with a stylized compass rose. Above the entire landscape, a flock of 870 birds (puffins, if possible) flies in formation, starting densely packed in the north and gradually scattering as they reach the south, symbolizing the 870 miles. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades of blue, green, and lavender, with accents of yellow and heather purple, creating a visually appealing and memorable representation of the UK mainland's length. The perspective should be slightly elevated, giving a panoramic view of the entire journey.
