A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a serene, rolling British landscape under a vast, pastel-colored sky reminiscent of a historical painting. The foreground features a split scene. On the left, a Scottish soldier with traditional garb is depicted lying defeated near a simple wooden bar, subtly representing "Dunbar". The bar is old and weathered, suggesting a time long past. On the right, further into the background, there is a silhouette of defeated Scottish soldiers moving away from a wisp of smoke rising from the aftermath of a battle, indicating "Worcester." Cromwell can be seen as a very small figure on the horizon, leading his army away from the Scottish. The overall color palette should be muted, with blues, reds, and whites subtly incorporated to reflect the UK flag. The composition emphasizes the vastness of the landscape, underscoring the historical significance of the battles. The style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and solemnity, similar to classical war paintings, but with a softer, more approachable feel appropriate for educational purposes. The light should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of depth and atmosphere.
