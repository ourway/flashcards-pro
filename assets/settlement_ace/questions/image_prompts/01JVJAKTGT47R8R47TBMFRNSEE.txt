A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting an Iron Age Celtic settlement in Britain. The scene is set in a verdant valley with rolling hills in the background, reminiscent of the Scottish Highlands. In the center of the image, a group of Celtic people are gathered around a large, crackling bonfire. Their faces are weathered and expressive, adorned with traditional Celtic woad markings in swirling patterns. They wear hand-woven woolen garments in earthy tones of brown, green, and ochre, reflecting the natural dyes available at the time. Some hold simple tools and weapons, like spears and axes with bronze fittings. A storyteller, an elderly woman with long, braided hair streaked with grey, sits slightly elevated on a rocky outcrop, gesturing animatedly as she speaks. Her mouth is open, suggesting she is narrating a tale in the Celtic language. The flames of the bonfire dance upwards, casting warm light on the faces of the Celts and illuminating the surrounding settlement, composed of several roundhouses with thatched roofs. The overall color palette leans towards the pastel shades of blue, green, and brown, intermingled with the red-orange hues of the fire. The composition is arranged to draw the eye towards the storyteller and the bonfire, emphasizing the oral tradition and the Celtic language as a central element of their culture.
