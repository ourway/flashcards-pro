A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a grand, yet approachable, building facade reminiscent of classic British architecture, rendered in a pastel colour palette. The building's central entrance is framed by ornate, but not overwhelming, stonework. Above the entrance, a subtly stylized, symbolic depiction of interconnected gears, subtly resembling the cogs of a clock, are integrated into the architectural design, painted in pastel blue. The gears are interlocked, representing the interconnectedness of work and social security. In front of the building entrance, a pathway leads towards the viewer, lined with neatly manicured, stylized flowerbeds containing pastel red and white roses, subtly referencing the colours of the UK flag. A stylized, open ledger book rests on a small, elegant table to the right of the pathway, symbolizing documentation and application processes; the pages are blank. The overall atmosphere should convey a sense of trustworthiness, stability, and accessibility, reinforcing the idea of a governmental organization dedicated to work and pensions. The sky above the building should be a soft, pastel blue with gentle, watercolour-style clouds. The colour theme should be pastel and the UK flag should be reflected via colour of the objects in the picture.
