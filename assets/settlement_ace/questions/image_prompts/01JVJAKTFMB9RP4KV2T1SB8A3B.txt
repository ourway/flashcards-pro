A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a symbolic scene representing the transition of the Irish Free State to the Republic of Ireland in 1949. The scene is set against a backdrop of rolling green hills reminiscent of the Irish countryside, rendered in soft pastel greens and blues. In the foreground, a sturdy stone bridge, symbolizing the Irish Free State, is gradually transforming. On the left side of the bridge, representing the past, the stone is rough and weathered. As the bridge extends towards the right, symbolizing the future, the stone becomes smoother and more refined. At the bridge's midpoint, a subtle, stylized depiction of a phoenix, rendered in pastel shades of orange and yellow, rises from the bridge, signifying rebirth and a new beginning. A gentle stream flows beneath the bridge, its water reflecting the pastel colors of the sky above. The sky itself is a blend of soft blues and whites, suggesting a peaceful dawn. In the far distance, faintly visible on the horizon, are traditional Irish thatched-roof cottages, rendered in muted browns and creams, adding a sense of history and place. The overall composition should evoke a sense of serenity, hope, and the passage of time, visually anchoring the transition year of 1949 in the viewer's mind. The entire image should be contained within a 16:9 aspect ratio, with the main focus on the transforming bridge and rising phoenix in the center of the composition.
