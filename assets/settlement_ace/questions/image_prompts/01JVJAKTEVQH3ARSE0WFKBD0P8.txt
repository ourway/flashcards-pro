A hand-drawn, realistic watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a softly glowing oil lamp, intricately designed with subtle floral patterns reminiscent of Victorian aesthetics. The lamp is placed on a simple wooden bedside table. Emanating from the lamp is a warm, gentle light, casting soft shadows on the surrounding objects. Behind the lamp, slightly out of focus, is a silhouette of a hospital ward with beds neatly aligned. A nurse in a traditional, long blue dress and white cap is tending to a patient in one of the beds, her posture reflecting care and attentiveness. The color palette should predominantly feature pastel shades, with the blue of the nurse's dress mirroring the blue in the UK flag. The background features a very subtle, almost faded, depiction of the Houses of Parliament in London, symbolizing the British context. The overall composition should evoke a sense of tranquility, compassion, and dedication to care, visually connecting the lamp to the development of nursing, and Florence Nightingale's legacy.
