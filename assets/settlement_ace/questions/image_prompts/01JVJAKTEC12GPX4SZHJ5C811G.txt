A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical map, depicting southeastern Europe as the cradle of early agriculture. The artwork focuses on the Balkan Peninsula and surrounding areas, rendered in a soft, pastel color palette. Rolling hills and fertile valleys are painted with subtle gradients of green and brown, suggesting the agricultural richness of the region. Small, stylized depictions of early farming activities are scattered throughout the landscape: figures tilling the land with primitive tools, planting seeds, and harvesting crops like wheat and barley. Villages with simple, thatched-roof houses nestle in the valleys, smoke gently rising from their hearths. A winding river, symbolizing the lifeblood of the region, flows through the center, its waters reflecting the pastel sky above. In the distance, the faint outline of mountains adds depth and perspective. The overall composition is designed to evoke a sense of history and the dawn of civilization, emphasizing the pivotal role of southeastern Europe in the development of agriculture. The style should be reminiscent of illustrations found in old geography textbooks, aiming for clarity and educational value. The image should be strictly 2D with no text or numbers.
