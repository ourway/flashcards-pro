A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style (16:9 ratio) depicting a grand, ornate stage bathed in a soft, focused spotlight. In the center of the stage, elevated on a velvet cushion, rests a vinyl record album. The album's cover is subtly designed with interwoven Celtic knots and a faint outline of the British Isles (UK and Ireland) formed by constellations. The spotlight is a warm, golden hue, creating a sense of prestige and importance. The background is a muted, pastel blue, reminiscent of the sky at twilight, with faint silhouettes of iconic landmarks from both the UK and Ireland (e.g., Edinburgh Castle, Cliffs of Moher) subtly integrated as part of the stage backdrop. The overall color palette favors pastel shades of red, white, and blue, echoing the colors of the UK flag, with touches of green to represent Ireland. The stage itself is made of dark polished wood, reflecting the spotlight and adding depth to the image. The composition should emphasize the central importance of the album, subtly hinting at the UK and Ireland connection through the cover design and background elements, creating a memorable visual association with the Mercury Music Prize. The image should be artistic and educational, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements.
