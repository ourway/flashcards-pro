A watercolor illustration in a realistic style, portraying a serene Scottish landscape under a pastel dawn sky, predominantly in hues of blue and soft red, reminiscent of the UK flag. In the center, a traditional stone archway, symbolizing a gateway or passage, stands prominently. Emerging from the shadows on one side of the archway are figures representing vulnerable individuals, their faces subtly suggesting relief and hope. On the opposite side, silhouetted figures stand guard, representing protection and intervention. Above the archway, eleven stylized thistles, Scotland's national flower, are arranged to subtly suggest the year '2011', with their delicate details and pastel coloration adding to the overall symbolic representation. The scene evokes a sense of freedom, safety, and the protective embrace of the law, emphasizing Scotland's commitment to safeguarding individuals from forced marriage. Soft light bathes the scene, highlighting the vulnerability of the figures and the strength of the protection offered. The entire composition is designed to be visually memorable, linking the imagery of protection, Scotland, and the year 2011 in a meaningful way.
