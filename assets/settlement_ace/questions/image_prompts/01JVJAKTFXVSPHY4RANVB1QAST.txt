A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant scene set in London, 1928. The composition centers around a jubilant procession of women marching towards the Houses of Parliament, their faces radiating joy and determination. Predominantly use a pastel color palette, interspersed with subtle hints of red, white, and blue evoking the UK flag. Focus on the women's attire reflecting the fashion of the late 1920s: flapper dresses, cloche hats, and sensible walking shoes. Some carry hand-painted banners with symbolic imagery of equality, such as a balanced scale or a rising sun. In the background, the iconic clock tower of the Palace of Westminster (Big Ben) is visible, partially obscured by a soft, pastel-colored mist. The architectural details of the Houses of Parliament should be accurate and rendered with precision. A few male figures are interspersed amongst the crowd, some observing with supportive smiles, others with expressions of contemplation. The overall atmosphere should convey a sense of historic significance and triumphant achievement. The sky is soft pastel blue with delicate watercolour clouds. The light should be diffused and gentle, creating a sense of nostalgia and historical distance.
