A serene, hand-drawn, watercolor landscape depicting a quintessential British national park under a pastel sky. Rolling green hills dominate the scene, dotted with sheep grazing peacefully. A meandering river cuts through the valley, reflecting the soft light. In the foreground, a stone wall, characteristic of the British countryside, stretches across the image, subtly suggesting the boundary of the protected area. The overall color palette should lean heavily on pastel greens, blues, and yellows. A variety of native British trees, such as oak and birch, are scattered across the hillsides, their leaves rendered with delicate detail. The composition should emphasize the vastness and tranquility of the landscape. A small, traditional stone cottage with a slate roof nestles into the hillside, blending harmoniously with the natural surroundings. The sun should be positioned slightly off-center, casting long, soft shadows that enhance the depth and dimension of the scene. A sense of protected, untouched beauty should be the dominant theme. The sky is a blend of pastel blues and pinks, creating a peaceful and inviting atmosphere. The art style should be realistic, but with a soft, painterly quality that evokes a sense of nostalgia and appreciation for the natural world. The image ratio is 16:9, and the main subject should be in the center.
