A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic watercolor style, depicting a somber scene evocative of the medieval Black Death. The color palette leans heavily on muted blues, grays, and deep reds, reminiscent of the somber tones often associated with historical depictions of the plague. In the center of the 16:9 landscape composition, a medieval village is illustrated with thatched-roof cottages and a stone church, all rendered with careful attention to historical accuracy. Villagers are sparsely scattered, some tending to their homes, others lying prone and ill, displaying visual signs of bubonic plague such as swollen lymph nodes (buboes) under their arms. A doctor in traditional plague doctor garb, complete with a long beak-like mask and dark robes, stands near one of the afflicted, holding a vial of herbs, symbolizing the desperate attempts to combat the disease. Rats, subtly placed but clearly visible, scurry through the streets, carrying fleas. The sky is overcast, casting a gloomy light over the scene, reinforcing the sense of despair and widespread death. The overall artistic style aims for a balance between historical accuracy and emotional impact, avoiding cartoonish or abstract representations in favor of a realistic and sobering depiction of a devastating historical event.
