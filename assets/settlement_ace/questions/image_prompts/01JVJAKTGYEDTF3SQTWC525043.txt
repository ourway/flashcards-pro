A vibrant, watercolour-style illustration depicting a hot air balloon gracefully ascending over a quintessential English countryside scene. The balloon's basket is ingeniously crafted to resemble a patchwork quilt, with 27 distinct patches, each a unique pastel colour (blues, reds, and creams mimicking the UK flag subtly). Each patch should be subtly different in texture and pattern. The countryside below features gently rolling green hills dotted with sheep and traditional stone cottages. A winding river snakes through the landscape, reflecting the soft light of the setting sun. The sky above is a gradient of pastel blues and pinks, with fluffy white clouds scattered throughout. The overall composition should be warm and inviting, evoking a sense of peacefulness and nostalgia. The artistic style should lean towards realism, capturing the textures of the landscape and the intricate details of the balloon's patchwork. The light source should be from the setting sun, casting long, soft shadows that add depth and dimension to the scene. The image should be devoid of any text, relying solely on visual cues to represent the number 27. The balloon is the main focus and should be in the center of the image.
