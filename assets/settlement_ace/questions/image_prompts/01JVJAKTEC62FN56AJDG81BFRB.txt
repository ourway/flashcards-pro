A hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a grand, circular clock face reminiscent of Big Ben, but instead of hours, it's divided into five equal segments. Each segment is coloured in a pastel shade: light blue, soft pink, pale yellow, mint green, and lavender. Positioned at the centre of the clock is a stylized representation of the European Parliament building, depicted with a simplified but recognizable architectural silhouette. Radiating outwards from the building toward each segment are thin, elegant lines, like sunbeams or clock hands. In each segment, a small, diverse group of people are depicted in miniature, representing the citizens of different European nations, all looking towards the central Parliament building. The background is a soft, diffused wash of pastel colours blending into each other. The entire image is framed within a 16:9 aspect ratio, with the clock face and parliament building centrally positioned. The overall impression should be one of regular, cyclical activity and the representation of diverse European voices converging every five years.
