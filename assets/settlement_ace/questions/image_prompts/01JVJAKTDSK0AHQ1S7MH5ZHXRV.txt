A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, set against a soft pastel blue background. The central focus is a stylized polling station, depicted with classic British architectural elements like red brick and arched windows. Queuing to enter the polling station are a diverse group of people representing the UK's multicultural society. However, one individual in the queue is subtly highlighted: they are holding a European Union flag discreetly folded under their arm. This person has a thoughtful, slightly conflicted expression. A faint, symbolic "X" is overlaid onto their form, almost like a watermark or a ghosted image, signifying exclusion. The ballot box inside the polling station is adorned with a miniature Union Jack flag. Soft, diffused lighting creates a gentle, inviting atmosphere, yet the overlaid "X" on the EU citizen introduces a subtle sense of restriction. The colour palette primarily consists of pastel blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag, with touches of other pastel colours to represent the diversity of the UK population. The composition is balanced and symmetrical, drawing the eye to the central figure and the overlaid "X", thereby visually representing the exception that EU citizens cannot participate in all UK public elections, specifically general elections. The style should evoke a sense of British heritage while remaining accessible and educational.
