A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical botanical illustration, set against a soft, pastel-toned background. The composition is centered, adhering to a 16:9 ratio. On the left side of the image, depict a meticulously rendered Roman villa garden. Within the garden, showcase examples of introduced plants and animals. Prominently feature a Roman snail (Helix pomatia), a rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) grazing, and a cherry tree (Prunus avium) laden with fruit. The plants should be depicted with botanical accuracy, showcasing their leaves, flowers, and fruit in detail. The animals should be anatomically correct and realistically rendered. On the right side of the image, subtly juxtaposed, illustrate a Roman magistrate seated at a table, meticulously writing on a scroll. Behind him, suggest the architectural elements of a Roman forum or law court â€“ perhaps a column or a fragment of a Latin inscription. The magistrate should be depicted in traditional Roman attire. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, creams, and muted reds, reminiscent of faded frescoes, subtly echoing the colours of the Union Jack flag without being overt. The overall impression should be one of learnedness, historical accuracy, and the lasting legacy of Roman contributions to Britain, visually symbolizing plants and animals on one side and the essence of Roman law on the other.
