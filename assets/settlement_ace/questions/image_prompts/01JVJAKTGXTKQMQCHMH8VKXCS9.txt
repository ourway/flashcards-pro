A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format, focusing on a single, exquisitely detailed Tudor rose. The Tudor rose should be centrally positioned within the frame. The rose itself is a composite, featuring outer petals of a vibrant, deep red, rendered with subtle gradations of color to convey depth and texture. Nestled within the heart of the red petals are inner petals of pure, crisp white, equally detailed to show their delicate form. The leaves surrounding the rose should be a rich, verdant green, providing a strong contrast to the red and white. The style should evoke historical botanical illustrations, with an emphasis on accuracy and beauty. The color palette should be primarily pastel, with the deep red and green balanced by the white, creating a harmonious and visually appealing image. The background should be a soft, diffused off-white, allowing the rose to be the clear focal point without any distractions. The overall impression should be one of elegance, unity, and historical significance, subtly referencing the union of the Houses of York and Lancaster.
