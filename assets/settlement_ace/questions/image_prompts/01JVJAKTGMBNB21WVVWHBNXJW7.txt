A hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format. The scene depicts two stylized, interconnected trees in the center of the frame. The tree on the left, representing Facebook, has leaves shaped like speech bubbles in pastel blue hues, with winding vines forming the letter "f" subtly woven into the trunk. Small, hand-painted icons of people interacting are nestled among the leaves. The tree on the right, representing Twitter, has leaves shaped like miniature birds in pastel light blue colours. A gentle breeze subtly animates the birds, suggesting the rapid flow of information. The trunks of both trees are intertwined at the base, symbolizing connection and shared usage for social events. Below the trees, a quaint village green is suggested with pastel green grass and a winding path. Soft, diffused sunlight bathes the scene, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere. The overall colour palette should emphasize pastel blues and greens, with hints of pastel red. The art style aims for realism with a touch of whimsy, avoiding cartoonish elements. The interconnected trees should dominate the composition, serving as a clear visual metaphor for the linked social networking platforms. The composition should focus on the center of the image.
