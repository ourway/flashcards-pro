A meticulously hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic watercolor style, depicting St. George slaying a dragon, set against a backdrop subtly reminiscent of the English countryside. St. George, clad in shining, but not overly bright, silver armor with a red cross emblazoned on his chest, is astride a white steed rearing up on its hind legs. His lance is piercing the dragon's heart. The dragon, a formidable but not overly grotesque creature, writhes in pain, its scales a mix of dark greens and browns. The background features rolling green hills dotted with quaint English villages. The sky is a soft, pastel blue with fluffy white clouds. The overall color palette leans towards the red and white of the English flag, subtly incorporated. Light should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of heroism and timelessness. The composition places St. George and the dragon in the center, with the landscape providing context and depth. The image aims to evoke a sense of courage, chivalry, and the triumph of good over evil, all associated with the Patron Saint of England. The image ratio is 16:9.
