A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a classic watercolor painting, depicting a vibrant scene of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The composition is centered to fit the 16:9 aspect ratio. The foreground features the iconic Belfast City Hall, rendered with precision in a pastel colour palette, highlighting its architectural details and grandeur. Behind the City Hall, the River Lagan flows gently, reflecting the surrounding buildings and sky. On the river, subtly include a silhouette of the famous Harland and Wolff shipyard cranes ("Samson and Goliath"), symbols of Belfast's shipbuilding history, but without overwhelming the central focus. The sky above is a soft blend of blues and whites, suggesting a clear, bright day. In the background, rolling green hills characteristic of the Northern Irish landscape provide a scenic backdrop. Include subtle details like neatly arranged streets with vintage-style streetlamps, and a few carefully placed trees with lush foliage. The overall atmosphere should evoke a sense of tranquility, history, and civic pride, making Belfast easily recognizable as the capital city. The colour palette should subtly incorporate shades of blue, white, and a touch of red, reminiscent of the UK flag, while maintaining a soft, pastel aesthetic.
