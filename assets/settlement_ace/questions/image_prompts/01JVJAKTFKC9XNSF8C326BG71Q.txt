A somber, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central image features a medieval English village scene, shrouded in a thick, swirling mist rendered in shades of deep grey and muted purple, creating an atmosphere of foreboding and despair. Houses with thatched roofs are visibly decaying, with some partially collapsed, indicating neglect and abandonment. In the foreground, a lone, cloaked figure, their face obscured by shadows, pushes a wooden cart piled high with bodies wrapped in simple linen shrouds. The cart's wheels leave dark tracks in the muddy ground. Dominating the background is a gnarled, leafless oak tree silhouetted against a stormy, overcast sky, its branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. Scattered across the scene are symbolic elements: a broken hourglass lying on its side, representing the fleeting nature of life; a raven perched on a crumbling stone wall, symbolizing death and ill omen; and withered crops in a neglected field, signifying widespread famine. The overall color palette leans towards muted blues, greys, and browns, with occasional splashes of dark red to subtly represent the plague's devastating impact. The watercolor technique should emphasize texture and detail, capturing the harsh realities of medieval life and the overwhelming sense of loss associated with the Black Death. The composition should draw the viewer's eye towards the cart and the cloaked figure, highlighting the human cost of the disaster.
