A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the Battle of Trafalgar. The central focus is a dramatic naval engagement between British ships (predominantly displaying the Union Jack) and ships bearing the flags of France (French Tricolore) and Spain (Spanish flag with the Royal Coat of Arms). The British ships are painted with slightly brighter colors, predominantly red and white, symbolizing their victory. The French ships are depicted in deep blues and whites, and the Spanish ships in yellows and reds, reflecting their alliance. The sea is a mix of turbulent blues and greens, with whitecaps indicating the intensity of the battle. Cannon smoke fills the air, partially obscuring the ships in the distance, rendered in shades of gray and white to convey the chaos of war. The sky is a dramatic blend of pastel blues and grays, hinting at an overcast day, with a subtle break in the clouds allowing a ray of light to highlight the British flagship. The composition should emphasize the alliance between France and Spain against Britain, visually representing the key players in the Battle of Trafalgar.
