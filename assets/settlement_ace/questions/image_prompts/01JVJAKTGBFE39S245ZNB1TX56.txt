A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical portrait painting, depicting a stylized family tree. The central focus is on two prominent roses: one representing Anne Boleyn, depicted in rich, deep red hues, and another representing Catherine Howard, in softer, light pinks. The roses are connected by a delicate, intertwining branch, subtly symbolizing their familial relationship. The background is a muted, pastel blue, evoking a sense of historical distance and melancholy. Beneath each rose, a faint, almost ethereal crown rests, hinting at their shared royal connection and tragic fates. The overall composition is symmetrical, with the roses centered within the 16:9 frame, allowing for easy visual focus. The branches of the family tree extend outwards, subtly incorporating Tudor roses (red and white) to further emphasize the Tudor dynasty. The art style should mirror historical portraiture, with detailed rendering of the roses and a soft, diffused light source adding depth and gravitas. The color palette should predominantly feature reds, pinks, and blues, mirroring the colors of the UK flag while maintaining a delicate, watercolor aesthetic. The image aims to evoke a sense of historical connection and tragedy, serving as a visual mnemonic for the relationship between Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard.
