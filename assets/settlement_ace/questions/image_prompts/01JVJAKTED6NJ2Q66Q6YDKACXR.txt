A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a symbolic representation of Queen Victoria, depicted not as a portrait, but as a strong, maternal oak tree, deeply rooted in the British Isles. The roots of the oak spread outwards, subtly transforming into outlines of India, Australia, and the African continent, rendered in muted pastel shades of red, white, and blue, reminiscent of the UK flag. The branches of the oak extend upwards and outwards, laden with symbolic fruits: miniature crowns representing the diverse regions under British rule. Beneath the tree, a gentle, flowing river represents the Thames, its waters reflecting the vast expanse of the empire. The sky above is a soft, pastel blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds shaped like old sailing ships, symbolizing Britain's naval power and global reach. The overall composition aims to convey a sense of immense scale and historical significance, emphasizing the widespread influence of the British Empire during the Victorian era. The color palette should lean towards pastel hues to create a gentle and educational atmosphere, avoiding harsh or aggressive tones.
