A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor painting depicting a pie chart representing the United Kingdom's population distribution. The pie chart is sliced into four sections, each representing a constituent country. The largest slice, representing England, occupies approximately 84% of the pie and is colored in a vibrant, pastel rose color, reminiscent of the English rose. This dominant slice is adorned with subtle, hand-painted details of iconic English landmarks like the Houses of Parliament and rolling green hills. The remaining three slices, representing Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, are colored in pastel shades of blue, representing Scotland, a light pastel green, representing Wales and a very light pastel yellow, representing Northern Ireland. These slices are significantly smaller, visually emphasizing the population disparity. Each smaller slice contains subtle representative imagery: a thistle for Scotland, a daffodil for Wales, and a shamrock for Northern Ireland. The pie chart rests on a vintage, wooden table, suggesting a sense of history and tradition. The background is a soft, diffused light, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The overall art style should be realistic, yet gentle, avoiding harsh lines or overly saturated colors. The composition should be centered, with the pie chart as the focal point, ensuring clarity and immediate visual impact. The image should evoke a sense of geographical awareness and the proportional distribution of population within the UK.
