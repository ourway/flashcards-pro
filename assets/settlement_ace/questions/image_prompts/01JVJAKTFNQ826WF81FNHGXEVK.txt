A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements. The scene depicts Queen Elizabeth I, adorned in her royal attire with a Tudor Rose emblem subtly incorporated into her gown, standing centrally. She is holding a large, ornate balance scale. On one side of the scale, a collection of Catholic symbols (a rosary, a chalice, and a depiction of a stained-glass window) is placed. On the other side, corresponding Protestant symbols (an open Bible, a quill, and a depiction of a simple wooden church) are balanced. The scale is perfectly level, signifying equilibrium. The background features a blend of architectural styles, subtly merging elements of Catholic cathedrals and Protestant churches, rendered in soft pastel shades of blue, red, and white, reminiscent of the UK flag. Light should be soft and diffused, highlighting the delicate watercolor textures and the Queen's serene expression. The overall composition should emphasize balance, harmony, and the Queen's role as a mediator. The image ratio is 16:9, landscape orientation, with the main elements centered.
