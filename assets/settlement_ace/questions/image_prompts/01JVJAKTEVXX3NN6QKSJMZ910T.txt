A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour image in a realistic style, depicting a group of refugees fleeing France between 1680 and 1720. The scene is set on a weathered, wooden dock at night, under a full, silvery moon that casts long shadows. The refugees, dressed in simple, muted-toned clothing (primarily blues, creams, and faded reds, mirroring the UK flag's palette in a subtle way), are embarking onto a small, overcrowded sailing ship. Several carry bundles tied with large, complicated knots, visually representing the "huge knots" mnemonic for "Huguenots." The expressions on their faces range from fear and desperation to hope and determination. The French coastline recedes into the background, shrouded in mist and darkness, symbolizing the danger they are leaving behind. The turbulent sea, rendered in deep blues and greens, reflects the challenging journey ahead. The overall composition emphasizes the movement away from France, with the ship angled towards the right, suggesting progress towards a new home. The art style evokes a historical painting, with attention to detail in the clothing, the ship's rigging, and the texture of the wood. The entire image aims to capture the gravity and emotional weight of the Huguenots' plight, creating a memorable visual aid for recalling the term.
