A serene, hand-drawn watercolor landscape depicting the Scottish Highlands under a vast, pastel blue sky. The highlands should feature rolling hills covered in heather in various shades of light purples and greens, evoking a sense of tranquility and natural beauty. In the foreground, a calm loch mirrors the sky, with a barely visible, stylized silhouette of the Loch Ness Monster adding a touch of subtle mystique without being cartoonish. Dominating the center of the image is a majestic stag, its antlers adorned with delicate, stylized thistles. The stag is positioned proudly, symbolizing Scotland's natural heritage and strength. The color palette should primarily consist of soft blues, greens, purples, and browns, subtly reminiscent of the Scottish flag and landscape. The overall art style should be realistic yet gentle, aiming for an educational and calming visual representation of Scotland as part of the United Kingdom. The composition should emphasize the vastness and beauty of the landscape, creating a memorable and positive association with the correct answer. The image should be 16:9 and landscape.
