A watercolor painting in a realistic style, ratio 16:9, depicting a vibrant birthday celebration centered around a young person turning sixteen. The scene is set indoors, perhaps in a cozy living room decorated with pastel-colored balloons (primarily light blues, pinks, and whites). The birthday person, a teenager with a beaming smile, is sitting at a table adorned with a birthday cake. The cake is decorated with sixteen candles, all lit. Family members surround the table, their faces expressing joy and excitement. In the foreground, a wrapped gift is being handed to the birthday person. The wrapping paper is a light blue with white polka dots. Peeking out from under the wrapping is a lottery ticket. The lottery ticket features a subtle design, avoiding any specific numbers or text, but clearly recognizable as a lottery ticket. The overall color palette should evoke a sense of celebration and youthful joy, predominantly using pastel shades, with accents of red in the decorations to subtly reference the UK flag. The lighting is soft and warm, creating a welcoming and cheerful atmosphere. The background includes details like party banners and streamers, further emphasizing the celebratory mood. The composition should focus on the exchange of the gift, particularly the lottery ticket, highlighting the significance of turning sixteen and being legally allowed to purchase one. The style should be realistic and detailed, with attention to the expressions and gestures of the characters, and the textures of the objects.
