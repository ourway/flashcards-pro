A serene, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format, employing a pastel color palette with subtle reds and blues reminiscent of the UK flag. The central focus is a meticulously rendered, vintage-style clock face, its hands positioned precisely at 11 o'clock. The clock is slightly aged, with subtle cracks on its porcelain surface, suggesting the passage of time and history. Radiating outwards from the clock are poppy flowers, delicately painted in varying shades of red, symbolizing remembrance. The poppies aren't densely packed but are arranged in a semi-circular fashion, creating a visual field emanating from the clock. Surrounding the poppies is a misty, soft-focus background depicting a tranquil British countryside scene â€“ rolling green hills dotted with a few bare trees silhouetted against a pale, overcast sky. The overall mood is one of quiet contemplation and solemnity. The absence of any human figures emphasizes the universal nature of remembrance. The style should evoke classic British landscape painting, with a focus on detail and atmospheric perspective. The light should be soft and diffused, enhancing the feeling of peace and reflection. The poppies should appear fragile and ephemeral, reminding the viewer of the fleeting nature of life.
