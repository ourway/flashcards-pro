A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a cross-section of stratified earth, revealing layers of soil and rock. At the bottommost layer, representing the Iron Age, are several crudely fashioned, dark grey, iron coins scattered amongst iron tools and weaponry. Above this layer, the soil transitions to a lighter brown, representing later periods, with progressively more refined coins made of bronze and silver appearing in the subsequent layers. The Iron Age layer is subtly illuminated with a warm, flickering light, suggesting the glow of a blacksmith's forge. The overall color palette leans towards earthy tones and pastel blues, reminiscent of the UK flag. The composition emphasizes depth and historical progression, with the Iron Age coins forming the foundation of British currency. Delicate root systems from plants above intertwine throughout the layers, symbolizing the passage of time and the embedded nature of history. The background subtly fades into a soft, watercolor wash of blues and grays, evoking a sense of ancient mist and mystery. The artistry should evoke a sense of age and discovery, emphasizing the foundational role of the Iron Age in British economic history.
