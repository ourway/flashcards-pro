A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a vintage engineering diagram, depicting James Watt meticulously adjusting a complex steam engine. The engine is the central focus, rendered with intricate detail, showcasing its pistons, valves, and boiler. Wisps of steam escape from various points, subtly hinting at the immense power contained within. Watt, dressed in period attire ( breeches, waistcoat, and a powdered wig), stands beside the engine, holding a wrench and peering intently at a pressure gauge. The background features a stylized representation of a British factory during the Industrial Revolution, complete with smoking chimneys and silhouette of workers. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, creams, and reds reminiscent of the Union Jack, creating a sense of British heritage and historical significance. The lighting is soft and diffused, highlighting the engine's mechanical intricacies and Watt's focused expression. The composition is carefully balanced, drawing the eye towards the steam engine and Watt as the primary subjects, while the factory background adds context and depth. The scene should evoke a sense of innovation, progress, and the transformative power of steam. The style should be educational and suitable for all ages.
