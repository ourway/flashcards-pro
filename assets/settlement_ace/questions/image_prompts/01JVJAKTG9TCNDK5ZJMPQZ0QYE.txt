A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the majestic Snowdonia National Park in Wales. The scene should be framed within a 16:9 aspect ratio, with the heart of the composition centered. Towering, mist-shrouded mountains dominate the backdrop, their peaks kissed by the soft glow of early morning light. Lush, verdant valleys stretch out below, dotted with traditional Welsh stone cottages with slate roofs, smoke curling gently from their chimneys. A winding river, reflecting the pastel hues of the sky, snakes through the valley floor. In the foreground, a lone Welsh Mountain Sheep grazes peacefully on the hillside, its white fleece contrasting against the vibrant green grass. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel blues, greens, and grays, with subtle hints of red in the wildflowers scattered across the landscape, echoing the colours of the UK flag. The overall atmosphere should evoke a sense of tranquility, natural beauty, and the enduring spirit of Wales. The style should be reminiscent of classic landscape paintings, emphasizing detail and realism to capture the essence of Snowdonia's breathtaking scenery. A subtle Celtic knot pattern could be incorporated into the border of the image, further reinforcing the Welsh connection.
