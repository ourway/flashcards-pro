A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, rendered in a pastel color palette. The central focus is a dramatically lit, silver serving platter placed on a sturdy, dark wood table. Upon the platter sits a beautifully presented haggis, artfully sliced to reveal its savory filling. Surrounding the haggis are sprigs of fresh, vibrant green thyme and rosemary, lending a sense of culinary artistry. Behind the platter, slightly out of focus, is a traditional Scottish scene. Rolling, heather-covered hills stretch towards a misty, pastel blue sky. A lone bagpiper, dressed in full traditional highland regalia with a kilt in a muted tartan pattern, stands silhouetted against the horizon, his bagpipes raised in mid-play. To the left of the platter, a partially visible, heavy, antique silver quaich (a traditional Scottish drinking vessel) sits filled with a golden liquid, reflecting the light subtly. The overall composition should evoke a sense of Scottish heritage, culinary tradition, and the natural beauty of the Highlands, all contributing to a memorable visual association with Scotland. The image should be 16:9, with the main subject in the center.
