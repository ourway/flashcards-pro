A meticulously detailed, realistic watercolor illustration in a pastel color palette. The central focus is on a traditional Scottish Sheriff Court building. The building is constructed from light grey stone, reminiscent of classic Scottish architecture, with a slate grey roof. The building's entrance is grand, featuring a heavy, arched wooden door. Flanking the entrance are two meticulously drawn Scottish flags gently waving in a soft breeze. To the left of the court building, a stately Scottish Sheriff stands tall, dressed in traditional court attire â€“ a black robe and a white powdered wig. He holds a rolled parchment in his hand, symbolizing legal authority. To the right of the court building, a meticulously detailed Scottish landscape unfolds, featuring rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep and a meandering river in the distance. The sky above is a soft, pastel blue with wisps of white clouds. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, creating a serene yet authoritative atmosphere. The color palette consists of soft blues, greens, greys, and whites, evoking a sense of calm and order. The style should lean towards realism, with attention to detail in the architectural elements, clothing, and landscape.
