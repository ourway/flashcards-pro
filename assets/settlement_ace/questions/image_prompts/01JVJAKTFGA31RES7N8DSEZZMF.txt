A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting four distinct, adjacent landscapes representing the four countries of the United Kingdom. The artwork should be in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a soft, pastel-colored map of the UK, with each country subtly delineated. England is represented by rolling green hills dotted with quaint villages, painted in shades of light green and cream. Wales is depicted with majestic, mist-covered mountains in hues of slate grey and lavender. Scotland features a serene loch reflecting a dramatic, cloudy sky, rendered in blues and greys. Northern Ireland is illustrated with vibrant green fields divided by stone walls, with a small registration form resting on one of the walls, subtly hinting at individual registration. The overall color palette should be pastel, with occasional pops of red, white, and blue reminiscent of the UK flag, integrated subtly into the landscapes (e.g., wildflowers in England, a distant boat on the Scottish loch). The style should be reminiscent of a classic travel poster, emphasizing the beauty and diversity of the UK, while the placement of the registration form in Northern Ireland serves as a visual cue to remember the correct answer. The artwork should evoke a sense of calm and familiarity, making it memorable and easily recalled.
