A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Union Jack flag as its central focus. The flag should appear slightly distressed, as though it's been waving proudly for centuries. A vibrant St. George's Cross (England) in bold red is prominently displayed, layered with the white and blue of the St. Andrew's Cross (Scotland). The St. Patrick's Cross (Northern Ireland) is also visible, forming its distinctive red saltire on a white background. To the lower-right side of the flag, slightly faded and partially obscured by the waving fabric, illustrate a stylized, ancient Welsh Dragon looking forlornly at the flag, its head slightly bowed in the direction of the Union Jack, but not directly integrated into the flag's design. The colours should be predominantly the red, white, and blue of the Union Jack, with pastel shades used to soften the overall effect and create a sense of historical depth. Use light brush strokes to give a sense of motion to the flag. The background should be a soft, watercolour wash of pale grey, resembling a misty morning sky over the rolling hills of the British countryside. The composition should emphasize the flag's incompleteness in representing Wales, creating a visual mnemonic for the question's false statement.
