A watercolour painting in a realistic style, ratio 16:9. The scene depicts a grand, stylized map of the United Kingdom, its landmass gently rising from a textured, parchment-like background. The map is subtly coloured in pastel shades of blue, red, and white, reminiscent of the Union Jack. Overlaying the map, almost transparently, are two small, distinct symbols. On the left side of the map, near London, is a delicate Star of David, rendered in a light golden hue. On the right side, near Wales, a stylized lotus flower, symbolising Buddhism, blooms in soft pinks and whites. These symbols are intentionally small and understated, occupying a combined area visibly less than half of one percent of the total map area. The rest of the map is intentionally left blank, except for the outlines of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The overall composition should convey a sense of serenity and historical significance, emphasizing the small but present contribution of these communities to the UK's cultural landscape. The watercolour effect should give the image a soft, approachable feel, suitable for educational purposes. The symbols should be easily identifiable but not overwhelming, reinforcing the concept of 'less than 0.5%'.
