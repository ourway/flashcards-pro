A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, resembling a vintage textile illustration. The scene focuses on a rustic workshop interior, bathed in soft, natural light filtering through a window. Dominating the center is a wooden carding table, upon which lies a fluffy pile of raw, undyed wool fibers in various shades of cream and off-white. A pair of antique hand cards, resembling hairbrushes with fine wire teeth, are positioned on either side of the wool. One card is shown gently teasing and aligning the fibers, creating a smooth, uniform texture. The background features subtly rendered details: a spinning wheel tucked into a corner, skeins of yarn hanging from a wooden beam, and a glimpse of the rolling green hills of the British countryside visible through the window. The color palette leans towards soft pastels – muted blues, creams, and gentle greens – reminiscent of the UK flag's colors, creating a calming and nostalgic atmosphere. The composition is balanced, with the carding table as the clear focal point, drawing the viewer's eye to the process of fiber preparation. The overall impression is one of traditional craftsmanship and the rich history of textile production in the UK.
