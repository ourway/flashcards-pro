A meticulously detailed, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting Sir Robert Walpole standing proudly in front of 10 Downing Street. Walpole is dressed in the formal attire of the 18th century: a powdered wig, a finely embroidered waistcoat in pastel blue, and a dark blue tailcoat. He holds a long, ornate wooden pole, similar to a surveyor's pole, firmly planted on the ground. This pole is decorated with subtle carvings of the British lion and unicorn. 10 Downing Street is rendered with accuracy, showcasing its Georgian architecture and the iconic black door with the number '10' subtly suggested through the arrangement of the bricks. The sky above is a soft, watercolour wash of pastel blue and white, reminiscent of a clear morning in London. Around Walpole's feet, delicate watercolour flowers in pastel pinks, yellows, and blues bloom, symbolizing the flourishing of British politics under his leadership. The overall composition should evoke a sense of historical gravitas and stability, with the central focus firmly on Walpole and his symbolic 'pole,' visually cementing his role as the first 'Prime Minister.' The color palette should be dominated by pastel blues, whites, and hints of pastel reds, echoing the colors of the Union Jack in a subdued and elegant manner.
