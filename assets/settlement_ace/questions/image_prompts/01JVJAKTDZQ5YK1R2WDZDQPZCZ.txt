A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting a quaint British village scene at precisely 11:00 AM. The focal point is a traditional, stone-built Public House, its exterior adorned with hanging flower baskets overflowing with red geraniums, white petunias, and blue lobelia, subtly mirroring the colors of the Union Jack. Sunlight bathes the building, casting a warm glow on the freshly painted green door, which is now open. A cheerful, middle-aged woman with rosy cheeks, dressed in a floral dress, stands just outside the pub door, holding it open with one hand while smiling warmly. A cobblestone street leads towards the pub, with a vintage red bicycle leaning against a nearby lamppost. In the background, rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep fade into a pastel blue sky with fluffy white clouds, suggesting a peaceful, rural setting. The overall color palette should be soft and inviting, dominated by pastel shades of green, blue, red, and cream, creating a welcoming and memorable scene that subtly hints at the opening time of the pub. The style should be realistic but with a touch of whimsy, reminiscent of a classic children's book illustration.
