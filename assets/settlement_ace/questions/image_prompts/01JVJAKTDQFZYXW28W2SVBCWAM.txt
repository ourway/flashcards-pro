A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting the Crystal Palace. The Crystal Palace should be the central focus, rendered with incredible detail showcasing its cast-iron framework and vast expanses of glass, shimmering subtly with reflected light. The structure should be surrounded by meticulously manicured Victorian gardens with vibrant flowerbeds in pastel colours and elegantly dressed figures strolling along gravel paths. Inside the Palace, hint at various exhibits; large machinery partially visible through the glass, exotic plants, and sculptures, giving a sense of the Great Exhibition's contents. Use a pastel colour palette dominated by soft blues, pinks, and greens, with subtle touches of gold to highlight the architectural details. The sky should be a soft, watercolour wash of pale blue, suggesting a bright, sunny day. The composition should emphasize the grandeur and scale of the Crystal Palace, conveying its significance as a symbol of Victorian innovation and industrial progress. The overall feeling should be one of awe and wonder, capturing the essence of the Great Exhibition and the architectural marvel that housed it. The image should be framed in a 16:9 ratio, with the Crystal Palace dominating the central view.
