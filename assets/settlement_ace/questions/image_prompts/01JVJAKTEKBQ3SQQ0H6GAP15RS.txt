A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style map of the British Isles, rendered in a soft pastel color palette. The map should be predominantly central in the 16:9 frame. England is represented by rolling green hills dotted with quaint villages and iconic landmarks like Stonehenge, gently lit by a warm, golden sun. Scotland is depicted with majestic, mist-covered mountains, deep blue lochs reflecting the sky, and a proud stag standing on a rocky outcrop. Wales is shown with dramatic, rugged coastlines meeting the sea, lush valleys, and a red dragon emblem subtly integrated into the landscape as a natural rock formation. Northern Ireland is illustrated with rolling green fields, serene lakes, and the Giant's Causeway represented as naturally formed hexagonal columns reaching into the ocean. Each region should be distinctly defined yet seamlessly connected, emphasizing their unity within the United Kingdom. Subtle color variations should differentiate each region while maintaining a cohesive pastel theme. The overall composition should evoke a sense of harmony, history, and the diverse beauty of the UK.
