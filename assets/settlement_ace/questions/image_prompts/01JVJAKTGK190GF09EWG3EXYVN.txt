A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style (not cartoonish or abstract), depicting a serene yet subtly melancholic scene from the Scottish Highlands. The composition should be landscape, 16:9 ratio, with the main focal point in the center. Rolling, heather-covered hills dominate the background, rendered in soft pastel purples, greens, and browns. In the mid-ground, a small, stone-built croft (traditional Scottish farmhouse) stands partially dilapidated, with a wisp of smoke barely rising from its chimney. A winding path leads away from the croft, disappearing into the distance. On this path, a family, depicted from the back to emphasize their departure and anonymity, walks away. The adults are dressed in simple, muted earth-toned clothing, carrying bundles on their backs, while small children struggle to keep pace. In the foreground, a flock of fluffy, white sheep grazes peacefully on the land, their wool depicted with delicate brushstrokes to create a soft texture. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades, with touches of muted red and blue to subtly evoke the UK flag. The sky should be overcast, with soft, diffused light casting long shadows, adding to the sense of loss and displacement. The entire scene should convey a feeling of quiet desolation and the irreversible change brought upon the landscape and its people, subtly hinting at the Highland Clearances. The image should be devoid of any text or numbers.
