A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Florence Nightingale in a Crimean War hospital setting. The scene is composed within a 16:9 landscape format, with the primary focus centered. Nightingale, wearing a traditional nurse's uniform of the era (a long, dark dress with a white cap and apron), is holding a lit oil lamp, casting a warm, gentle glow across the dimly lit ward. The lamp is a crucial symbolic element, representing her dedication and the nickname 'Lady with the Lamp.' Around her, wounded soldiers lie in simple cots, their faces expressing pain and gratitude. The color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, gray, and white, with subtle hints of red to symbolize the conflict and the human cost. The background includes architectural details of a rudimentary hospital ward â€“ stone walls, arched windows letting in minimal light, and simple wooden furniture. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet dedication, compassion, and the stark realities of war. The light from the lamp should be the brightest point, drawing the viewer's eye and emphasizing Nightingale's central role as a caregiver. The brushstrokes should be delicate and detailed, capturing the textures of the fabrics, the roughness of the stone, and the expressions on the faces of the characters. The image evokes a sense of historical accuracy and emotional depth, highlighting Nightingale's contribution to nursing.
