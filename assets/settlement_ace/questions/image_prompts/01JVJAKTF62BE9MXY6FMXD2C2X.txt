A hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The color palette leans towards pastel hues with subtle hints of red, white, and blue, reminiscent of the UK flag. The central focus is on two intertwined hands – one male, one female – depicted from the wrist up. The woman's hand is gently pulling away, her fingers slightly curled in a gesture of resistance and discomfort. A faint, ethereal, almost translucent depiction of a marriage band encircles her ring finger. The man's hand is reaching forward, his fingers appearing more forceful and assertive. A symbolic padlock, rendered in soft grey tones, hangs open in the space between their hands, representing the concept of consent. Delicate watercolor washes create soft shadows and highlights, emphasizing the emotional weight of the scene. The background is a muted, textured paper effect, giving the impression of an old legal document. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of intimacy breached and the importance of consent within a marriage, avoiding any explicit or inappropriate content. The style is realistic, not cartoonish, to convey the seriousness of the subject matter.
