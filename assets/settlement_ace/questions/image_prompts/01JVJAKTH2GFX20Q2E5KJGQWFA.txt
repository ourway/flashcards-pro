A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting the interior of the House of Commons during a secret ballot. The color palette should be primarily pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The composition is centered on a stylized, ornate ballot box placed on a polished wooden table in the foreground. Around the table, blurred figures of Members of Parliament (MPs) are depicted in various poses, some approaching the ballot box with folded papers, others standing in hushed conversation, suggesting the secrecy and gravity of the vote. Each MP should be individually distinguishable by subtle variations in attire and facial features, avoiding any caricature. Light streams in from large, arched windows, casting soft shadows and highlighting the solemn atmosphere. The background features the recognizable green benches and architectural details of the House of Commons, rendered with accurate perspective and intricate detail. The overall feeling should be one of respectful democracy and hidden decision-making. Small details such as feathered quills on desks and scattered parchment should add to the historical and formal setting. The image should avoid any cartoonish elements, maintaining a realistic and dignified portrayal of the event.
