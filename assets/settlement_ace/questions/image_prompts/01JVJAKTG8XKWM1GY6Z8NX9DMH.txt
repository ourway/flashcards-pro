A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration depicting a festive Hogmanay celebration in a quaint Scottish village. The scene is set against a backdrop of snow-dusted, rolling hills and traditional stone houses with warmly lit windows. Dominating the center is a group of villagers, dressed in traditional Scottish attire, gathered around a large bonfire. Some are playing bagpipes and drums, their cheeks puffed with effort, while others are engaged in lively Scottish country dancing. A few figures are seen 'first-footing,' carrying symbolic gifts like coal, shortbread, and whisky, ready to share good fortune for the coming year. Above the village, the night sky explodes with colorful fireworks, illuminating the joyous faces below. The color palette predominantly features deep blues and purples of the night sky, contrasted by the warm oranges and yellows of the bonfire and the fireworks. Accents of red and white are incorporated through the traditional Scottish clothing and the snow-covered landscape. The overall style is realistic yet imbued with a sense of wonder and festivity, capturing the spirit of a Scottish New Year. A wisp of mist circles the scene to add to the festive atmosphere.
