A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the iconic scales of justice, perfectly balanced. Each pan of the scale holds symbolic representations of rights: one pan contains a blooming rose representing women, intertwined with a sturdy oak sapling representing men, both flourishing equally. The other pan features a miniature house symbolizing property ownership, a wedding ring signifying marriage, and a briefcase for work. The scales are rendered in shades of pastel blue and pink, reminiscent of the UK flag's gentler hues. A soft, diffused light illuminates the scene, highlighting the delicate brushstrokes and watercolor textures. The background is a subtle gradient of pastel cream, suggesting impartiality and fairness. The scales themselves are crafted from polished silver, reflecting the light and emphasizing their importance. The entire composition is centered within the 16:9 aspect ratio, creating a sense of equilibrium and visual harmony. The image should evoke a sense of established legal fairness, emphasizing that the law treats both genders equally in the UK.
