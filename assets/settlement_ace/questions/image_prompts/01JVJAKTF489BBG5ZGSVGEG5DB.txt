A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolour style, ratio 16:9. The scene depicts a bright and airy room, not a traditional courtroom. In the center, a round wooden table is surrounded by four people. One person, a kind-faced, middle-aged woman with short grey hair and wearing a simple blue dress, sits at the head of the table, acting as the judge. She holds a pen and a small notepad. On either side of the table are two individuals representing the disputing parties. To the left, a young man in a casual shirt looks slightly nervous. To the right, an older woman in a cardigan appears calm and collected. A vase of pastel-colored flowers sits in the middle of the table, adding a touch of informality. The background is a soft, pastel blue, with a large window letting in natural light. The overall atmosphere is relaxed and approachable, emphasizing the informal nature of the small claims procedure. The colours are predominantly blue and white, reminiscent of the UK flag, with accents of pastel floral colours. The style should evoke a sense of trustworthiness and accessibility, ensuring it is educational and memorable.
