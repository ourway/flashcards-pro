A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting three distinct vignettes arranged horizontally across a 16:9 landscape. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly evoking the UK flag without explicitly replicating it. The central vignette portrays a stylized office scene: a forlorn employee stands before a stern-looking manager, paperwork scattered on the floor, subtly symbolizing "unfair dismissal or discrimination in the workplace." The second vignette, positioned to the left, depicts a simplified interior of a house. A landlord and a tenant stand on opposite sides of a table, with keys and a contract lying on the table, visually representing "disputes between landlords and tenants." The right vignette showcases a customer holding a broken toaster, facing a shopkeeper behind a counter filled with household appliances, symbolizing "faulty consumer goods or services." The composition should be balanced, with each vignette receiving equal visual weight. Fine details, such as the expressions on the characters' faces and the textures of the objects, should be rendered with precision. The overall tone is serious but not overly dramatic, reflecting the nature of civil law disputes. The background should be a soft, blurred wash of pastel colors, providing a neutral backdrop that allows the main subjects to stand out. The illustration should be clear, informative, and easily understood at a glance, serving as a memorable visual aid for recalling examples of civil laws.
