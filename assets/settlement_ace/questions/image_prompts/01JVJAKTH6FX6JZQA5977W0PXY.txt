A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic educational charts. The composition is divided into two distinct halves, each representing one of the Secretary of State's responsibilities. The left half depicts a vibrant, bustling schoolyard scene. Children of diverse ethnicities are shown engaged in various learning activities: reading books under a large oak tree, experimenting with science equipment, and painting at easels. A stately, traditional British school building forms the backdrop, its architecture reflecting academic history. The overall color palette leans towards pastel yellows, greens, and blues, creating a sense of youthful energy and intellectual curiosity. The right half portrays a scene of national defense. It features a squadron of modern fighter jets soaring through a clear blue sky, leaving contrails that subtly evoke the shape of the Union Jack. Below, a group of soldiers in ceremonial uniforms stands guard before a historic castle, symbolizing the protection of the realm. The color scheme for this side incorporates shades of grey, navy blue, and a touch of red, conveying strength and solemnity. The overall image should be framed in a way that balances the two scenes, emphasizing their equal importance and the Secretaries of State's oversight of both education and defense.
