A watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a nighttime scene centered around the Houses of Parliament in London. The sky is a deep twilight blue fading to a soft orange glow near the horizon. Silhouetted against the sky is the iconic outline of the Houses of Parliament, with the clock tower (Big Ben) subtly highlighted. In the foreground, a carefully arranged pile of firewood is prepared for a bonfire, casting warm, flickering light onto the cobblestone ground. The bonfire is not yet lit, symbolizing the plot that was foiled. Hidden behind the woodpile, partially obscured by shadows, is a figure dressed in dark clothing, representing Guy Fawkes. He is holding a lantern that casts a faint, conspiratorial glow on his face. The overall color palette should lean towards blues, oranges, and browns, reminiscent of a bonfire night sky. The composition should evoke a sense of suspense and historical significance, with the bonfire representing the intended explosion and the shadowed figure embodying the foiled plot. The style is evocative and historical, using watercolor techniques to create a sense of depth and atmosphere. The intention is to illustrate the historical event, focusing on the key elements: Parliament, the plot, and Guy Fawkes, without any text or numbers. The colors used should be a pastel colour palette to create a sense of calm and history.
