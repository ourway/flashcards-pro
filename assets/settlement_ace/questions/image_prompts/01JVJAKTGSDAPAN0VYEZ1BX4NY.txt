A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image depicting Whitehall in London, focusing on the Cenotaph war memorial. The scene is bathed in a soft, pastel-dominated color palette, with subtle hints of red and blue reminiscent of the UK flag subtly incorporated into the surrounding architecture and foliage. The Cenotaph itself stands prominently in the center, rendered in realistic detail, its white stone contrasting gently with the surrounding environment. Behind the Cenotaph, depict the iconic buildings lining Whitehall, such as government offices, with recognizable architectural features like arched windows and classical columns. The composition should emphasize depth, drawing the viewer's eye from the foreground Cenotaph into the background street scene. Include subtle details like British flags gently waving from the rooftops of buildings, and perhaps a few figures in period clothing walking along the pavements to subtly evoke the historical context. The overall art style should be photorealistic, emphasizing the solemnity and historical significance of the location. The sky should be slightly overcast, typical of London weather, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene and enhancing the memorial's somber atmosphere. Focus on capturing the essence of Whitehall as a place of government and remembrance.
