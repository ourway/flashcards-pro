A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolour image in a realistic style, depicting a grand, medieval oak table scene bathed in soft, diffused light. The colour palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, reminiscent of the UK flag but in muted tones. Dominating the center of the image is a large, ornately decorated parchment, representing the Magna Carta. A regal-looking quill pen rests upon it, seemingly having just finished writing. Around the table sit several figures: a stern-faced king with a golden crown, his expression conveying reluctant acceptance; and a group of noblemen, their faces reflecting a mix of triumph and cautious optimism. Their clothing is richly detailed, showcasing the fashion of the early 13th century, with fine fabrics and heraldic symbols. Sunlight streams in from a high, arched window, illuminating the scene and highlighting the texture of the parchment and the fabrics. The window overlooks a serene, green English countryside, symbolizing the land and its people. The king's hand is slightly outstretched, as if he is about to affix his seal to the document. The overall composition should convey a sense of historical importance, the balance of power shifting, and the establishment of fundamental rights, creating a memorable visual representation of the Magna Carta's significance in limiting royal power. The image should have a 16:9 aspect ratio, with the main focus on the table and figures in the center.
