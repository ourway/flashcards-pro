A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting St. Augustine arriving in Canterbury. The colour palette should primarily consist of pastel hues, with subtle accents of red, white, and blue reminiscent of the UK flag. The image, in a 16:9 landscape format, centres on Augustine, portrayed as a serene and scholarly figure in traditional religious robes, holding a bishop's staff. He is stepping onto the shores of Canterbury, which is rendered with rolling green hills and the iconic Canterbury Cathedral subtly visible in the background. A small group of Anglo-Saxons, their faces expressing curiosity and respect, are kneeling before him. Gentle sunlight filters through the clouds, casting a warm glow on the scene and illuminating the hopeful expressions of the people. In the foreground, a single cornerstone is visible, symbolizing the foundation of the Church, with a tiny, intricately drawn Canterbury rose blooming nearby. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peace, history, and the beginning of a significant chapter in British religious history. The illustration should emphasize the architectural grandeur of the cathedral and the natural beauty of the Canterbury landscape.
