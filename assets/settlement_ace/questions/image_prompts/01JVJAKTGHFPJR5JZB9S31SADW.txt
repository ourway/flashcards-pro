A vibrant, watercolor-style landscape depicting the iconic Grand National horse race, hand-drawn with meticulous detail. The scene unfolds on a sprawling green racecourse, subtly hinted to be near Liverpool. In the foreground, several racehorses and jockeys are depicted mid-race, leaping over a meticulously rendered Becher's Brook fence. The horses are a mix of browns, blacks, and greys, with brightly colored silks worn by the jockeys. The background showcases a stylized representation of Liverpool's skyline, featuring the Liver Building with its distinctive Liver Birds perched atop. Instead of directly showing the city, rolling hills lead the eye towards the background where subtle hints of the city are visible, such as rooftops and the tops of cranes. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, dominated by greens, blues, and soft yellows, interspersed with the reds and whites of the jockey's silks, subtly mirroring the UK flag colors. The sky is a watercolour blend of light blue and white, suggesting a partly cloudy day. The composition should emphasize the dynamic movement of the race while firmly placing it within the context of the area near Liverpool. The artwork should evoke a sense of excitement and tradition, capturing the essence of the Grand National.
