A meticulously hand-drawn watercolour painting in a realistic style, depicting a grand, ornate theatre stage bathed in warm, golden light. The scene focuses on a laurel wreath crafted from delicate watercolour strokes, prominently displayed at the center of the stage. The wreath encircles a classical theatre mask, its expression a blend of comedy and tragedy, rendered with subtle shading and fine detail. The stage backdrop features a subtle, impressionistic rendering of famous London landmarks â€“ the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben barely visible in the background. The colour palette is predominantly pastel, with creams, golds, and pale blues creating a sophisticated and theatrical atmosphere. Light pastel pinks and reds should be used for the laurel wreath berries. The overall composition should evoke a sense of prestige, artistry, and British cultural heritage. The scene should imply a celebration of theatrical excellence, without explicitly depicting any people or text. The ratio is 16:9, and the main subject is in the center of the image.
