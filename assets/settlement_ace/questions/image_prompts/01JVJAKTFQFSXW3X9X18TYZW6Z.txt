A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting Dumfries House in Scotland, bathed in the soft, early morning light. The house should be prominently centered, showcasing its symmetrical facade and Palladian architectural style. The color palette leans heavily on pastel blues, creams, and muted reds, reminiscent of both the UK flag and the refined elegance of the era. In the foreground, subtly include architectural drafting tools – a rolled-up blueprint, a compass, and a set square – resting on a weathered stone balustrade. These should be arranged artfully, hinting at the meticulous planning and design process involved in creating the house. Above the house, instead of clouds, whimsical, ethereal architectural elements float – a keystone, a Corinthian capital, and a section of ornate frieze, all rendered in delicate watercolor washes. These elements represent Robert Adam's signature style and his profound influence on the design. The overall composition should evoke a sense of grandeur, sophistication, and historical significance, emphasizing the architectural legacy of Dumfries House and its creator. The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract interpretations, ensuring the image serves as a clear and memorable visual cue.
