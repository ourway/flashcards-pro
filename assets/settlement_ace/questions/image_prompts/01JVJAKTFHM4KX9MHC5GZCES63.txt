A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the English Civil War battle scene, focusing on the Cavaliers and Roundheads. The image should be in a 16:9 landscape format, with the primary action centered. The color palette should lean towards pastel hues, interspersed with symbolic reds, whites, and blues reminiscent of the UK flag. On the left side, visualize the Cavaliers: elegantly dressed soldiers with long, flowing hair and plumed hats, mounted on horseback, their banners displaying royal crests. Their armor reflects the soft sunlight, creating highlights. On the right, illustrate the Roundheads: more plainly dressed, with simple, round helmets (hence their name), some on foot, others on sturdy workhorses. Their banners bear symbols of Parliament. The background should feature a rolling English countryside with green fields, scattered trees, and a cloudy sky, all rendered in soft, delicate washes of watercolor. The composition should create a dynamic sense of movement and conflict, with swords clashing and horses rearing, but without any graphic violence. The overall tone should be historical and educational, evoking the era's atmosphere while remaining appropriate for all ages. The focus is on clear differentiation between the two groups through attire and symbolism, avoiding any text or numbers.
