A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style map of the island of Great Britain, occupying the central area of the 16:9 canvas. The island should be visually divided into three distinct regions, each representing one of the territories: Wales, England, and Scotland. England, the largest region, should be depicted in a soft, muted red, reminiscent of the St. George's Cross. Rolling green hills and patchwork fields should dominate the landscape, dotted with quintessential English villages and historic landmarks like Stonehenge subtly integrated into the terrain. Wales should be colored in a pastel white, echoing the dragon on the Welsh flag. The Welsh landscape should feature majestic mountains, lush valleys, and a coastline dotted with castles, evoking a sense of history and rugged beauty. Scotland should be rendered in a soft blue, mirroring the Saltire. The Scottish Highlands should be prominent, with towering peaks, deep lochs reflecting the sky, and scattered heather. Small details such as sheep grazing on the hillsides and fishing boats along the coastlines should add depth and authenticity. A thin, dark blue line should encircle the entire island of Great Britain, emphasizing its distinct geographical boundary. The surrounding sea should be a lighter shade of blue, creating a gentle contrast. The overall style should be reminiscent of a vintage map, aiming for clarity, accuracy, and aesthetic appeal, using a pastel color palette.
