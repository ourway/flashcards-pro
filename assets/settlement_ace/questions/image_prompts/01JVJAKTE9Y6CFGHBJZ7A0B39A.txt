A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a quintessential English countryside scene in full bloom. The central focus is a blossoming apple tree, its branches laden with pastel pink and white flowers, symbolizing the arrival of spring. At the base of the tree, a knight, clad in shining silver armor with a red cross emblazoned on his chest (representing St. George), stands triumphantly over a defeated, yet non-threatening, green dragon. The dragon is lying down, and St. George's spear is lying next to it, piercing the ground beside the dragon. Sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the scene. In the background, rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep stretch towards a clear, blue sky with fluffy white clouds. The overall color palette leans towards soft pastels, with accents of red, white, and blue subtly incorporated to evoke the colors of the UK flag. The composition is balanced, with the tree, knight, and dragon forming a harmonious triangular arrangement, drawing the viewer's eye to the heart of the image. The scene should evoke a sense of springtime celebration, chivalry, and English heritage.
