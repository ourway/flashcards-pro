A serene, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the arrival of the first farmers in Britain approximately 6,000 years ago. The central focus is a small group of Neolithic farmers, rendered in realistic detail, tilling a field beside a tranquil river. The farmers are dressed in simple, woven clothing of undyed wool, using primitive tools made of wood and stone to cultivate the land. One farmer sows seeds by hand, while another uses a rudimentary plow pulled by an aurochs, a type of ancient wild cattle. The landscape should be rolling green hills dotted with ancient oak trees, their leaves a vibrant mix of greens and yellows, suggesting early autumn. In the background, a Stonehenge-like structure is faintly visible on a distant hilltop, hinting at the spiritual beliefs of the time. The color palette leans towards pastel hues, primarily blues, greens, and earthy browns, evoking a sense of ancient tranquility. The sky is a soft, watercolour wash of light blue and pink, indicating the early morning or late afternoon light. The overall composition should be balanced and harmonious, conveying a sense of the dawning of agriculture in Britain, six millennia past, with the main idea in the center of the image.
