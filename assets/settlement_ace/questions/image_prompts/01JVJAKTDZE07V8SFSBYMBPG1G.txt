A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a set of antique balance scales, symbolizing justice and equality. The backdrop is a soft, pastel-colored field reminiscent of the English countryside under a gentle, overcast sky. On one side of the scale, a silhouette of a woman, dressed in clothing typical of the 1920s (flapper dress, cloche hat), is subtly embedded within a number '21'. This side of the scale is perfectly balanced. On the other side, mirroring the first, is a silhouette of a man, dressed in a suit of the same era, also subtly embedded within a number '21', indicating the equal voting age. The scales themselves are made of a dark, polished wood with brass accents, reflecting the historical period. Delicate wildflowers, primarily cornflowers (blue), poppies (red), and daisies (white), are scattered around the base of the scales, subtly incorporating the colors of the UK flag. The overall composition is centered, with the scales as the focal point, emphasizing the concept of balance and equality achieved in 1928. The watercolor should have soft, blended edges and a slightly aged appearance, evoking a sense of history and importance. The image should feel calm and hopeful, illustrating a significant step forward in women's rights in the UK.
