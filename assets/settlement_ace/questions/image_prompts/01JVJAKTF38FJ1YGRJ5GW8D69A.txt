A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style. The image, in a 16:9 landscape ratio, features a central scene depicting a group of diverse young people, aged 16-17, engaged in various outdoor activities. To the left, a small team is constructing a raised garden bed filled with colourful flowers in a community garden. Their clothing is casual and practical, and their expressions show teamwork and enthusiasm. To the right, another group is participating in a team-building exercise, such as navigating a low ropes course in a lush green park. The background shows a mix of urban and rural settings, subtly blending city buildings with rolling green hills. The overall colour palette should be pastel, with hints of red, white, and blue subtly incorporated into the clothing and scenery to reflect the UK flag. The art style should evoke a sense of youthful energy, civic engagement, and personal development. Avoid any imagery related to military training, such as uniforms, weapons, or drills. The composition should be balanced, with the activities clearly visible and the focus on the positive impact of the National Citizen Service on young people and their communities. The overall feel should be bright, optimistic, and educational, emphasizing skill-building, community involvement, and outdoor adventure rather than military preparation.
