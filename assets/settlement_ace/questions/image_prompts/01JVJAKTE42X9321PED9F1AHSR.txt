A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting Queen Elizabeth II during an international diplomatic event. She is standing gracefully on a stylized world map, primarily focusing on the United Kingdom and surrounding European countries. The world map appears as a soft, muted blue and green watercolor wash, providing a subtle backdrop. Queen Elizabeth II is dressed in a regal, light blue gown reminiscent of the British flag's colors, adorned with subtle floral embroidery representing the diverse nations within the Commonwealth. A delicate, flowing cape in white and red, also inspired by the Union Jack, drapes elegantly from her shoulders. She wears a simplified, elegant crown, not overly detailed, suggesting authority and tradition. Around the Queen, stylized doves of peace, rendered in soft pastel colors, are flying upwards, symbolizing diplomacy and international relations. The background features a subtle suggestion of international flags blurred and faded, creating a sense of global representation without explicitly showing any single nation's flag clearly. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, evoking a sense of calm authority and historical significance. The overall composition should center the Queen as the focal point, emphasizing her role as a symbol of the UK on a global stage.
