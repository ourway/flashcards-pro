A hand-drawn, realistic watercolour image depicting a grand, classical-style courthouse interior, bathed in soft, diffused light. The colour palette should be pastel, primarily blues and creams. Dominating the center of the image is a large, ornate compass rose inlaid into the marble floor. The compass needle points towards an open book resting on a judge's bench. The book's pages are illuminated, suggesting wisdom and guidance. The judge's bench is crafted from dark oak and adorned with subtle carvings of scales and gavels. Behind the bench, a stained-glass window depicts a symbolic scene of justice and fairness. Rays of light stream through the window, casting a gentle glow on the compass rose. To each side of the compass rose, there are two rows of people, listening attentively to the judge. The people are drawn with diverse ethnicities, representing the UK's multicultural society. The overall composition should convey a sense of order, clarity, and the judiciary's role in providing direction and understanding within the legal system. The art style is realistic watercolour with soft edges and fine details.
