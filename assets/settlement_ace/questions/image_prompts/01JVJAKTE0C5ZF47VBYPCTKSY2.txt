A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant scene representing Northern Ireland's commemoration of the Battle of the Boyne. The central focus is a lively street parade in a quaint Northern Irish town. Dominating the view are marchers dressed in historical attire reminiscent of the Williamite army, primarily in orange sashes and uniforms, marching with fife and drum bands. The buildings lining the street are depicted in soft pastel colors, with architectural details typical of Northern Ireland. Waving from the windows are small Union Jack flags, subtly integrated to represent the region's cultural context. In the foreground, children are shown watching the parade with fascination, some holding small handmade orange flags. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades with strong orange accents to emphasize the William of Orange connection. The sky is a soft, muted blue, adding to the tranquil yet celebratory atmosphere. The composition should emphasize the depth of the street, drawing the viewer's eye towards the background where rolling green hills characteristic of the Northern Irish landscape are subtly visible. The illustration should evoke a sense of historical remembrance, cultural pride, and community celebration, all while remaining strictly educational and devoid of any text or overtly political symbolism.
