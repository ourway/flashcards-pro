A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting the United Kingdom in 1901. The central focus is a stylized, verdant landscape of rolling hills reminiscent of the English countryside. Rising from this landscape are four distinct stacks, each representing ten towering structures. These structures aren't literal buildings, but rather abstract, vertically stacked representations of people, each subtly differentiated to symbolize individuals. Each stack should be coloured in different pastel shades, with the overall colour resembling the UK flag. The first stack is in pastel red, the second is in pastel white, the third is in pastel blue, and the fourth is in pastel white. Each stack is of equal height and visual weight. At the base of each stack, tiny figures in period attire (clothing styles of 1901) are depicted looking upwards, emphasizing the scale and grandeur of the "population towers." The overall composition should evoke a sense of historical significance and national pride, with a soft, diffused lighting effect that creates a nostalgic atmosphere. The sky should be a clear, pastel blue, and the overall tone of the image should be educational and informative. The image ratio is 16:9.
