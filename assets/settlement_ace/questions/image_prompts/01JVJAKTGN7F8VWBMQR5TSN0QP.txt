A serene, hand-drawn watercolor painting depicting the island of St. Helena under a vast, pastel-colored sky. The island, lush with green vegetation and dramatic cliffs, rises from a calm, turquoise sea. A winding coastal road encircles a portion of the island, hinting at human presence. In the center of the island, subtly embedded within the landscape, is a stylized, slightly faded, but recognizable Union Jack flag pattern. The pattern is not a literal flag but rather a clever integration of red, white, and blue flowers and natural formations within the island's geography. A delicate, almost transparent line, like a shimmering thread, visually connects St. Helena to a distant, slightly larger island representing the UK. This line symbolizes the connection and dependency, but it does not merge the two islands. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, greens, and reds reminiscent of the UK flag, creating a harmonious and calming visual. The scene should evoke a sense of distance, connection, and distinct identity, reinforcing that while St. Helena is linked to the UK, it retains its own separate existence. The artistic style should be realistic, with subtle details that encourage closer inspection, but avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements. The composition should emphasize the island's beauty and remote location.
