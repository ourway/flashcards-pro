A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour painting in a pastel colour palette, predominantly featuring soft blues, reds, and creams, depicting a scene transitioning from pre-Roman Britain to Roman occupation. The composition is split into two distinct halves. On the left, rolling green hills of the British countryside are dotted with simple, thatched-roof Celtic roundhouses, with people dressed in woven wool clothing tending to sheep and crops. A small wooden henge stands subtly in the background, bathed in the soft light of dawn. This side represents Britain before Roman influence. On the right, a Roman legion, rendered in considerable detail, is marching in formation towards a newly constructed Roman fort. The fort features classic Roman architecture â€“ arched gateways, stone walls, and tiled roofs. Roman soldiers are clad in their standard armour, carrying shields and spears. A Roman road, paved with stones, stretches into the distance. A subtle, almost ethereal, hourglass is positioned at the center of the image, with the sand nearly completely emptied, symbolizing the passage of time. The top chamber of the hourglass is positioned over the Celtic side, and the bottom chamber is positioned over the Roman side. The overall atmosphere should evoke a sense of historical transition and the passage of time. The background is a soft, watercolour wash, suggesting a vast and ancient landscape. The style should be reminiscent of historical illustrations found in textbooks, aiming for clarity and accuracy.
