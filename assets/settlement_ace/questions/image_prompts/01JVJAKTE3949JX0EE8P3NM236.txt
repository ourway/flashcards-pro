A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the iconic Scales of Justice set against a backdrop subtly evoking the British flag. The scales should be perfectly balanced, with each pan holding an abstract representation of diverse individuals, distinguished by varied clothing colors in pastel shades. The left pan contains figures in shades of blue, representing, for example, NHS workers and police officers, while the right pan contains figures in shades of red, representing the royal family and red telephone box tourists, all rendered in soft pastel tones. The central fulcrum of the scales should be intricately designed, incorporating subtle Celtic knotwork patterns. The background should feature a soft, blurred representation of the Palace of Westminster, rendered in muted grey and blue tones. Above the scales, a gentle light source illuminates the scene, casting soft shadows that highlight the balance and harmony. The overall color palette should predominantly feature pastel shades of blue, red, and white, echoing the colors of the UK flag, creating a sense of impartiality and fairness. The composition should emphasize the central balance, with the Scales of Justice dominating the frame, symbolizing the core principle of treating everyone with fairness in the UK.
