A hand-drawn, realistic image in a watercolor style, depicting a grand, stylized family tree against a soft, pastel blue sky. The tree's trunk is thick and ancient, representing the historical lineage of the House of Lords. On the left side of the tree, several branches are laden with vibrant, red apples (representing inherited titles), each branch leading directly from parent to child in a clear, unbroken line. However, on the right side of the tree, the branches are thinner and some are bare, with fewer apples. Some apples are falling from the branches on the right side, symbolizing the loss of automatic inheritance. A gentle wind blows from left to right, causing the red apples to fall. At the base of the tree on the right side, a small, newly planted sapling struggles to grow, signifying the introduction of life peerages, not based on hereditary titles. The overall color palette should be pastel, with hints of red in the apples and green in the leaves, evoking a sense of history and change. The composition should emphasize the contrast between the full, vibrant branches on the left and the sparser, changing branches on the right, visually representing the shift away from automatic inheritance of titles in the House of Lords.
