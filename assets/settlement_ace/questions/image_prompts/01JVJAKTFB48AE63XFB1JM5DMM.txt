A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a bright and airy office space. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the UK flag. The central focus is a circular arrangement of six diverse employees seated around a polished conference table. Each person is rendered with distinct ethnic features and professional attire. However, one employee, a woman of Asian descent, is visually isolated, with a slightly despondent expression and a subtle shadow cast over her figure. The other employees are engaged in conversation, seemingly oblivious to her isolation. A stylized, symbolic representation of scales of justice is subtly integrated into the background, slightly tilted, indicating imbalance. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of unease and unfairness, subtly hinting at workplace discrimination. The background features framed diplomas and certificates on the wall, representing professional accomplishments. The lighting is soft and diffused, except for the shadow subtly emphasizing the isolated employee. The image avoids any text or numbers, relying solely on visual cues to convey the concept of discrimination in the workplace as a civil offense.
