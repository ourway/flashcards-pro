A meticulously hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, rendered in a pastel color palette, depicting two distinct scenes subtly connected by a flowing, light-blue river. On the left side, visualize a cozy, pastel-yellow cottage with a slightly overgrown garden. A miniature, symbolic key hangs suspended above the cottage's front door, representing the landlord-tenant relationship. A pastel-red measuring tape extends from the cottage, subtly indicating property boundaries and potential disputes. On the river's opposite bank, a modern office building rendered in light pastel-grey and blue hues stands tall. Within the office, seen through large windows, are diverse figures working collaboratively. However, a single, slightly darker figure is subtly separated from the group, symbolizing workplace discrimination. A miniature set of balanced scales hangs above the office building, representing justice and fairness. The light-blue river that connects these two scenes symbolizes the overarching system of civil law that governs both landlord-tenant relations and workplace conduct. The overall composition should be balanced, with the cottage and office building being of equal visual weight, emphasizing the equal importance of these two examples of civil law. The style should evoke a sense of calm, fairness, and everyday life, reinforcing the connection to the correct answer.
