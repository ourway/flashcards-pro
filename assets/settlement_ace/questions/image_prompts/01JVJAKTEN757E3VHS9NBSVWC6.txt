A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic style, rendered in pastel colors, depicting a stylized representation of the United Kingdom in 1901. The central focus is a gently rolling green landscape, reminiscent of the English countryside, bisected by a winding river that symbolizes the passage of time. Emerging from the landscape are stylized human figures, each meticulously drawn to represent a segment of the population. Instead of depicting exactly 40 million figures, the artwork uses a symbolic approach. A cluster of 40 larger-than-average figures is centrally located, representing the actual population of 40 million, while a separate, smaller cluster of only 20 smaller-sized figures is positioned slightly off to the side, further away and partially obscured by mist, subtly implying their numerical insignificance in relation to the actual population. The larger group is depicted in brighter, warmer pastel tones, while the smaller group is rendered in cooler, more subdued tones to create a visual contrast. The composition should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and demographic scale, with the size and placement of the figures clearly communicating the correct answer (False). The style should be reminiscent of classic historical illustrations, with attention to detail in the clothing and overall aesthetic. The sky should be a soft, pastel blue with fluffy white clouds, adding to the serene and educational feel of the image.
