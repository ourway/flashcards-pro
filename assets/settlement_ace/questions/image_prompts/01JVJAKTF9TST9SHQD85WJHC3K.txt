A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, focusing on a stack of British pound sterling banknotes. The banknotes are arranged artfully, fanned slightly to display their intricate designs. Dominant colors should be pastel shades of blue, red, and white to mirror the UK flag indirectly. The central focus is a close-up of a Â£20 note featuring a portrait of a prominent British historical figure (e.g., William Shakespeare) on one side and an iconic British image on the other (e.g., The White Cliffs of Dover). The notes should have a tangible quality, with subtle creases and variations in texture visible. Behind the main stack, suggest other smaller stacks of coins and notes, fading slightly into the background to create depth. The background should be a soft, blurred representation of a traditional British market scene, hinting at the everyday use of the currency: baskets of flowers, partially visible shop signs with traditional fonts, and the suggestion of bustling crowds. The light should be soft and diffused, giving a warm, inviting feel to the image. The overall composition should evoke a sense of financial stability and the everyday economic activity of the United Kingdom.
