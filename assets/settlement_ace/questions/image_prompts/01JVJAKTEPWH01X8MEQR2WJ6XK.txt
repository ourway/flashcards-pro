A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park. The Palace should dominate the center of the 16:9 landscape composition, showcasing its intricate glass and iron structure. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the UK flag. The Palace should appear luminous, with sunlight glinting off its many glass panes, giving it a crystalline appearance. Surrounding the Crystal Palace, depict a vibrant Hyde Park scene, filled with elegantly dressed Victorian-era people strolling, picnicking, and admiring the structure. Include details such as horse-drawn carriages, ornate benches, and lush greenery to establish the historical context. The sky should be a soft, gradient blue with fluffy white clouds. The overall mood should be one of wonder, innovation, and Victorian grandeur. The architectural details of the Crystal Palace should be precisely rendered, highlighting its innovative design and the sheer scale of the edifice. The reflection of the surrounding park should be visible in the glass walls, adding depth and realism.
