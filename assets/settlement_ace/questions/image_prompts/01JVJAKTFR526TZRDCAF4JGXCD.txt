A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a series of dominoes falling in a chain reaction, set against a backdrop subtly reminiscent of the British countryside. The dominoes are arranged in a slightly winding line that curves gently into the distance, drawing the eye. Each domino is painted in a pastel color palette, with soft blues, pale pinks, and muted yellows predominating, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag. The first few dominoes are depicted in sharp focus, gradually softening in detail as they recede into the background, creating a sense of depth. Each domino is slightly different in its pastel shade, adding visual interest. The dominoes are falling from left to right, emphasizing the sequential nature of the "common law" concept. The background features a gently rolling green field with a hint of a cloudy sky rendered in soft watercolor washes. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a calm and educational atmosphere. The composition is carefully balanced, with the line of dominoes centrally positioned and the background providing context without distracting from the main subject. The overall impression should be one of interconnectedness and the principle of precedent, where each legal decision ('domino') follows and is influenced by the previous one.
