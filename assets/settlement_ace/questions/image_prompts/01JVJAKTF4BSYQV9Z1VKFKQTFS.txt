A meticulously detailed watercolor painting depicting a stylized globe, centered on the UK, rendered in soft, pastel hues of blue, pink, and white to subtly evoke the Union Jack. Emanating outwards from the globe are 190 distinct, miniature doves of peace, each slightly different in posture and feather detail, suggesting individuality within unity. These doves should not be uniformly spaced but rather clustered to create visual interest and depth. Each dove carries a tiny, stylized olive branch in its beak, rendered in shades of green. The background is a seamless gradient transitioning from a light sky blue at the top to a pale, sandy beige at the bottom, suggesting earth and sky. Around the central globe, a delicate wreath composed of interwoven thistle (symbolizing Scotland), shamrock (symbolizing Northern Ireland), and roses (symbolizing England) should encircle the globe, adding a layer of UK-specific symbolism. The overall style should be realistic but with a gentle, dreamlike quality, achieved through soft brushstrokes and diffused lighting. The composition should emphasize the interconnectedness of the doves and the central globe, visually representing the global unity fostered by the UN.
