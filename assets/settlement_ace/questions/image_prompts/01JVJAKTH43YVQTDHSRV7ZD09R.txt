A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a Scottish Highland landscape under a pastel blue sky. In the foreground, a majestic stag stands proudly on a heather-covered hill. The stag's antlers are adorned with thistles, the national flower of Scotland, intertwined with a subtle Saltire (Scottish flag) pattern using the pastel blue and white. Behind the stag, a winding road leads through a valley dotted with traditional stone cottages with red roofs. A loch reflects the sky, and in the distance, snow-capped mountains rise against the horizon. A bagpiper, dressed in traditional Scottish attire including a kilt with a muted tartan pattern, stands near one of the cottages, playing his instrument, with musical notes represented by small, stylized birds flying upwards. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades of blue, green, and purple, reminiscent of the Scottish landscape and subtly incorporating the colours of the Union Jack. The style should be detailed and evocative, capturing the essence of Scotland's natural beauty and cultural heritage. The composition should draw the eye to the stag as the central figure, emphasizing Scotland's identity and its place within the United Kingdom, with the elements surrounding the stag enhancing the association with Scotland.
