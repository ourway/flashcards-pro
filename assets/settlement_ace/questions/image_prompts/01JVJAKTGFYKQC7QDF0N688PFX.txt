A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic, watercolour style, depicting two distinct scenes side-by-side, divided by a stylized, winding road resembling the white stripe of the Union Jack. The left side illustrates a scene from the Hundred Years' War. English knights in shining armour, emblazoned with the St. George's Cross, are disembarking from longboats onto a French beach. The beach is littered with fleur-de-lis banners half-buried in the sand, and a medieval French castle looms in the background under a stormy, grey sky. The right side depicts a scene from the Crusades. English knights, again bearing the St. George's Cross, stand before the walls of Jerusalem. They are clad in chainmail and surcoats, with red crosses prominently displayed. A hot, arid landscape stretches behind them, featuring palm trees and Middle Eastern architecture. The sky is a bright, cloudless blue, contrasting sharply with the left side's stormy atmosphere. The colour palette should lean towards pastel shades, with hints of red, white, and blue subtly woven throughout to evoke the UK flag. The knights' armour should reflect light realistically, and the landscapes should be detailed with textures and subtle shading. The composition should emphasize the distance and foreign nature of both locations, highlighting the theme of English forces fighting abroad. The overall mood should be historical and slightly melancholic, reflecting the long and arduous nature of both conflicts.
