A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D illustration in a watercolor style, depicting the parallel growth of the aviation and automobile industries during the Great Depression. The colour palette should consist of soft pastel hues, with subtle nods to the UK flag colours in the background. The composition is divided vertically, with the left side showcasing a biplane soaring upwards against a backdrop of a stylized, pastel blue sky with fluffy white clouds, suggesting progress and overcoming adversity. The right side features a classic automobile, reminiscent of a 1930s model, driving forward on a stylized road. The road should be a muted grey. The biplane should be a light pastel red and the car should be a light pastel blue. Both the plane and the car should appear to be moving quickly and in the center of the image. Subtle details should include miniature stylized factories in the background to represent the industrial activity. The overall mood is one of hope and forward momentum amidst economic hardship. The perspective should be slightly elevated, providing a comprehensive view of both scenes.
