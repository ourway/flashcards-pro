A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic British political cartoons, depicting the interior of the UK Parliament's House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs). The color palette primarily consists of pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the Union Jack. The composition is centered on the Speaker's Chair, with rows of parliamentarians on either side, rendered with individual characteristics and expressions. The Prime Minister stands at a dispatch box, mid-speech, with a slightly raised eyebrow and a confident posture. Opposite, the Leader of the Opposition listens intently. Dominating the background, a large, ornate clock is prominently displayed, its hands pointing to a time that implies the event is happening mid-week. Light streams in from tall, arched windows, illuminating the scene with a soft, diffused glow. Symbolic elements include a quill pen resting on the dispatch box, representing the power of debate, and subtle shadows cast by the clock, reinforcing the regular, cyclical nature of the event. The overall mood is one of respectful yet lively political discourse, capturing the essence of PMQs as a weekly fixture in British politics. The detail in the architecture, clothing, and facial expressions should be high, creating a visually rich and memorable image.
