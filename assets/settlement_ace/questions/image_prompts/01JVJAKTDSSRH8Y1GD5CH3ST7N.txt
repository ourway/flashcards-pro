A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting the British Isles as the main subject, rendered in soft pastel colors. The central focus is on the UK mainland, illustrated with rolling green hills dotted with quaint villages, and crowned with a stylized, yet recognizable, London skyline in the background. To the west, subtly include the outline of Ireland. Positioned slightly apart from the UK mainland, yet visibly connected by a dotted line, are two distinct island clusters: the Channel Islands (Jersey and Guernsey depicted closely together) and the Isle of Man. Each island should have its own unique, miniature landscape. The Channel Islands feature gentle, sandy beaches and small harbors, while the Isle of Man showcases a miniature version of its famous Snaefell mountain. The dotted lines connecting the islands to the UK mainland are in a light blue, symbolizing a close, yet distinct, relationship. Above the UK mainland, paint a radiant, pastel yellow sun, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The composition should emphasize the geographical proximity and close relationship of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man to the UK, while visually separating them to indicate their distinct status. The overall feel is gentle, educational, and reminiscent of a vintage map, using a pastel color palette with occasional vibrant accents to highlight key features.
