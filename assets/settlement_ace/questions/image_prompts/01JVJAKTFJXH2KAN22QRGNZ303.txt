A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Adam Smith in his study. The scene should be set in a well-lit, book-lined room reminiscent of 18th-century Britain. Smith, dressed in period attire, sits at a large wooden desk covered with manuscripts and books. His quill pen is poised above a page, seemingly capturing a profound thought. Outside the window, a bustling marketplace scene is visible, showcasing various merchants and traders engaged in commerce. The colour palette should primarily consist of pastel colours, with touches of red, white, and blue subtly integrated to reflect the UK flag. A globe sits prominently on a side table, symbolizing the global impact of his economic theories. A stack of gold coins is placed near the marketplace scene outside the window, subtly linking Smith's work to wealth and prosperity. The overall composition should be balanced, with Smith as the central figure, drawing the viewer's eye to his intellectual pursuits and the real-world application of his ideas in the vibrant marketplace beyond. The image should evoke a sense of historical significance and intellectual depth, subtly hinting at Smith's role as the "Father of Economics" without explicitly stating it. The ratio is 16:9.
