A hand-drawn, realistic, 2D watercolour image in a 16:9 landscape ratio depicting a young driver, visibly nervous but determined, behind the wheel of a classic Mini Cooper. The Mini Cooper is painted in a pastel blue and white colour scheme. The driver is glancing at their side mirror, which reflects a large, stylized "R" plate affixed to the rear of the car. This "R" plate is predominantly red with a thin white border. The background features a quintessential British scene: a winding country road lined with lush green hedges and distant rolling hills under a pastel-blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. Symbolic elements include a small, slightly crumpled learner plate ("L") discarded on the dashboard, suggesting the driver has recently graduated from learner status. The overall composition is designed to be visually calming and supportive, emphasizing the transitional phase of a restricted driver gaining experience. The art style should be reminiscent of vintage travel posters, with soft edges and gentle colour gradients to create a feeling of nostalgia and encouragement. The focus should be on the "R" plate's prominence and clear visibility in the reflection, acting as the central visual cue for the answer. The nervous expression on the driver's face and the safe, pastoral environment should reinforce the idea of a driver under certain limitations, gaining experience in a secure setting.
