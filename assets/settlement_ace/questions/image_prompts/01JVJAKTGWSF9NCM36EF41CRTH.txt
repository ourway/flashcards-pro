A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting William of Orange's arrival in England. The scene is set on a cloudy day at the coastline of a white-cliffed shore, reminiscent of Dover. William, dressed in detailed, historically accurate attire of the late 17th century with orange accents on his clothing, stands prominently on the beach, his gaze determined. Around him are soldiers and horses disembarking from Dutch ships, their sails billowing in the wind, coloured in muted blues and greys to reflect the somber weather. In the background, the English countryside unfolds with rolling green hills and traditional thatched-roof cottages. The overall color palette leans toward pastel blues, greys, and oranges, subtly echoing the colors of both the Dutch and British flags without explicitly showcasing them. The composition is centered on William, emphasizing his arrival as a pivotal moment in history. To subtly allude to the year, eight ships are visible on the left side of the image, and another eight ships are visible on the right side of the image, creating a visual cue for '88' at the end of the year. The sky above is overcast, creating a dramatic effect, symbolizing the turmoil and change that accompanied William's arrival. No text should be included in the image.
