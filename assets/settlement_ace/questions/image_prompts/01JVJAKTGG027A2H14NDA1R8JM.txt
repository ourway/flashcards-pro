A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a large, stylized pound sterling symbol (Â£), overflowing with a cascade of copper-colored coins. Each coin is intricately detailed, reflecting light and shadow to give a sense of depth. The coins are arranged to visually suggest the number "100," perhaps with the larger coins forming the "1" and smaller, densely packed coins creating the two "0"s behind. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues, predominantly soft blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The background is a gentle, blurred wash of watercolor, suggesting a stylized cityscape of London with faint outlines of iconic buildings like the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben, but so subtle that they don't distract from the central subject. A delicate, vine-like illustration of a rose (the national flower of England) curls around the pound sterling symbol, adding an element of British heritage and elegance. The composition should evoke a sense of abundance and value, yet remain clean and uncluttered, ensuring the visual emphasis is on the coins and their arrangement, which subtly hints at the number 100. The style should be realistic yet artistic, avoiding harsh lines or overly simplistic shapes, creating an image that is both informative and aesthetically pleasing.
