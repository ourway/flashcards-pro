A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a pastel colour palette, depicting a traditional British countryside wedding scene with a subtle undertone of unease. The central focus is on a young couple standing before a vicar in a quaint village church. The bride, dressed in a flowing white gown, has a subtly distressed expression; her hands are clasped tightly together. A single tear is delicately drawn on her cheek. The groom, in a classic morning suit, stands rigidly beside her, his face unreadable. Behind the couple, two distinct groups of wedding guests are depicted. On one side, the bride's family and friends appear concerned and subdued, their body language suggesting worry. On the other side, the groom's family and friends have a more assertive and imposing presence. Subtly visible behind the couple, partially obscured by shadows, are symbolic representations of constraint: delicate vines subtly wrapping around the church pillars, representing a lack of freedom. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of forced compliance and the absence of genuine consent, while maintaining a delicate and respectful tone. The art style should be reminiscent of classic British watercolour illustrations, emphasizing soft textures and subtle emotional cues. The scene is bathed in soft, diffused light, highlighting the central figures and their contrasting emotional states.
