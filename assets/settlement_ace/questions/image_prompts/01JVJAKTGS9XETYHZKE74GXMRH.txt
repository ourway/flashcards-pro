A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image depicting a vibrant, stylized representation of the UK workforce, presented in a 16:9 landscape ratio. The central focus is a balanced composition of figures symbolizing workers. On the left side, a group of women is depicted, engaged in diverse professions: a doctor with a stethoscope, a teacher holding books, a businesswoman in a suit, and an engineer with blueprints. On the right side, mirroring the composition, are men in corresponding roles. The background features a soft, pastel-colored cityscape of London, subtly hinting at iconic landmarks like the Houses of Parliament and the Shard. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, soft reds, and creams, reminiscent of the UK flag's colors but in muted tones. The figures are drawn in a realistic style, with attention to detail in their clothing and expressions, conveying competence and dedication. The overall impression should be one of equality and balance, emphasizing the significant contribution of women to the UK workforce. The image should evoke a sense of harmony and progress, illustrating the equal representation of genders in various professions within the UK. The image is strictly 2D, with no text or numbers present.
