A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic British book illustrations, depicting a serene landscape of Stratford-upon-Avon. The central focus is a partially submerged, antique quill pen, crafted from a raven's feather, resting gently in the shallow, clear waters of the River Avon. The river reflects the pastel hues of the sky – soft blues, pinks, and creams – mirroring the UK flag's colour palette. The quill's tip is subtly stained with dark ink, suggesting recent use. The riverbank is lined with lush, verdant foliage, including weeping willow trees with delicate, cascading branches. In the background, quaint Tudor-style houses with thatched roofs and exposed timber frames nestle closely together, creating a picturesque townscape. The scene is bathed in the warm, diffused light of a late afternoon sun, casting long, gentle shadows that add depth and dimension. Birds circle overhead, adding a sense of peace and timelessness to the scene. The composition should be balanced, with the quill pen acting as the focal point, drawing the viewer's eye into the heart of Stratford-upon-Avon. The overall feeling should be one of historical significance, literary heritage, and quintessential English charm, suitable for educational purposes. The image ratio is 16:9.
