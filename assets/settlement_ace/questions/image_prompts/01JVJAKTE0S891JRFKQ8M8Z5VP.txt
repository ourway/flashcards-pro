A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor image depicting a scene from Iron Age Britain (16:9 ratio). The central focus is on a stylized cross-section of an Iron Age settlement, showcasing various aspects of daily life. On the left side of the settlement is a blacksmith working with iron, hammering a newly forged tool, with a small fire pit glowing with orange and yellow hues. To the right of the blacksmith, depict a craftsman carefully striking a blank coin with a die, creating the first coins of Britain. The coins should be round and metallic, with simple geometric patterns etched on their surfaces. The settlement itself is constructed from wattle and daub, with thatched roofs and wooden palisades. Around the settlement, rolling green hills extend into the background, dotted with ancient trees and grazing livestock. The sky above is a soft pastel blue, with fluffy white clouds drifting lazily by. The color palette should primarily consist of earthy tones, greens, browns, and muted reds, with subtle hints of blue and white to evoke a sense of the British landscape. The art style should be realistic and educational, aiming to accurately depict the Iron Age setting and activities. Emphasize the contrast between the dark iron tools and the bright, newly minted coins to highlight the historical significance of the period. The overall composition should be balanced and visually appealing, drawing the viewer's eye to the central scene of coin production within the Iron Age settlement.
