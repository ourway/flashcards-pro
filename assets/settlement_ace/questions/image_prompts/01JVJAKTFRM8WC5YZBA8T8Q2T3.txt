A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting Margaret Thatcher standing confidently in front of the iconic Houses of Parliament in London. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack. Thatcher, rendered with fine detail to capture her distinctive hairstyle and determined expression, is presented in a classic, tailored suit. A symbolic, stylized clock face, integrated subtly into the background behind the Houses of Parliament, shows the hands positioned to represent a significant duration of time, alluding to her long tenure. Around the clock, twelve stylized roses, each a different pastel shade, are arranged to represent the years of her service. The overall composition is balanced and centered, with the Houses of Parliament providing a recognizable and historically significant backdrop. The sky should be a soft, watercolor wash of blue and white, giving the scene a timeless, dignified atmosphere. The image conveys a sense of leadership, stability, and historical importance, emphasizing the length and impact of her time as Prime Minister.
