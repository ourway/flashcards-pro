A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a split scene. On the left side, a vibrant, bustling Youth Court interior, bathed in soft, pastel blue light. A gavel rests gently on the judge's bench, and a group of diverse teenagers (ages visually represented as 10-17) are present, some looking concerned, others thoughtful. The atmosphere is serious yet supportive. On the right side, separated by a subtle, faded line resembling the Union Jack flag, a traditional adult courtroom scene is shown, illuminated by a warmer, pastel red light. An individual who is visibly 18-20 years old stands before the judge. This side has a more formal and austere feeling, with lawyers in traditional attire and a more structured setting. The overall composition utilizes a 16:9 ratio, with the two scenes balanced on either side. The watercolor style lends a softness and approachability to the complex legal topic, while the realistic depiction ensures clarity and avoids misinterpretation. The pastel palette, inspired by the UK flag, contributes to the educational and non-threatening tone. The subtle line of the Union Jack between the two scenes visually represents the legal boundary and separation of the court systems. The colors should be soft and not too saturated.
