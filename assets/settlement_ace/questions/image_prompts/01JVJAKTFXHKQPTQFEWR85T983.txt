A watercolor painting in a realistic style depicting the four countries of the United Kingdom, each represented by a symbolic figure or landscape element, arranged in a horizontal composition. England is represented by a traditional thatched-roof cottage nestled amidst rolling green hills, subtly forming the shape of a lion. Wales is depicted by a majestic red dragon perched atop a craggy mountain peak. Scotland is symbolized by a proud stag standing amidst a field of heather, with a distant loch reflecting a clear sky. Northern Ireland is illustrated by a single, prominent, closed registration form resting on a cobblestone street, slightly isolated from the other three elements. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, with occasional pops of red, white, and blue reminiscent of the UK flag. The overall tone is serene and educational, emphasizing the geographical and cultural diversity of the UK while subtly highlighting the unique situation of Northern Ireland concerning individual electoral registration. The composition is balanced, ensuring that no single element dominates, but the isolated registration form for Northern Ireland draws the viewer's eye, acting as a visual mnemonic for the answer. The background should be kept simple and uncluttered, with a soft, diffused light illuminating the scene.
