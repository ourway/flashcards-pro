A hand-drawn, realistic 2D illustration in a watercolour style (pastel colours) depicting three figures representing the patron saints of the United Kingdom, arranged in a symbolic composition. In the center, a figure representing St. George is depicted wearing shining armour, holding a red cross shield and standing triumphantly over a slain, stylized green dragon. To St. George's left, representing Scotland, St. Andrew is portrayed as an elderly, wise man with flowing white hair and a blue robe, gently holding an X-shaped white cross (Saltire). To St. George's right, representing Ireland, St. Patrick is depicted as a kindly, robed figure with a bishop's mitre, holding a vibrant green shamrock in his hand. The background features a soft, blurred depiction of the Union Flag, with the crosses of the saints subtly visible within its design. The overall colour palette should be dominated by pastel shades of blue, white, green, and red, echoing the colours of the Union Flag. The composition should convey a sense of unity and harmony, with the three saints' symbols blending seamlessly to represent the formation of the Union Flag. The image should be 16:9 in landscape orientation, and the main subject should be in the center.
