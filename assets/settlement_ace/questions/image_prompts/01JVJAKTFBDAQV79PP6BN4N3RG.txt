A meticulously detailed, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format, evoking a sense of historical accuracy and tranquility. The central focus is a stylized, simplified church interior, bathed in soft, natural light streaming through clear glass windows. The color palette primarily utilizes pastel blues, creams, and whites, subtly referencing the UK flag while maintaining a serene atmosphere. Instead of elaborate Catholic iconography, the church is deliberately devoid of ornamentation. Simple wooden pews are neatly arranged, and a plain wooden table serves as the altar, adorned with a single, open book (suggesting the Bible) and a vase holding a few sprigs of lavender. The simplicity emphasizes the "pure" aspect of Puritan beliefs. Around the church, there are some people dressed in black and white clothes, with white hats. The overall composition should convey a sense of order, clarity, and unadorned devotion, visually contrasting with the ornate and complex imagery often associated with Catholicism. The scene should be peaceful and introspective, highlighting the Puritans' desire for a simpler, more direct relationship with God, and subtly misnamed as Catholics.
