A hand-drawn, realistically styled, 2D watercolour image in a 16:9 landscape format. The scene depicts a split view, contrasting the closing hours of a traditional British pub and a vibrant nightclub. On the left side, representing the pub, the scene is bathed in warm, muted yellow and orange tones, suggesting the setting sun. A partially closed wooden door with a traditional brass handle is visible, and a cleaning staff member is mopping the floor inside. A discarded newspaper lies near the door. The sky above the pub shows the transition to dusk. On the right side, representing the nightclub, the scene pulsates with cool blues, purples, and pinks, mimicking the colourful lights of a dance floor. Silhouettes of people dancing energetically are visible through a large window. A bouncer stands near the entrance, and a taxi pulls up to drop off more patrons. The sky above the nightclub is deep night blue, with a crescent moon hanging high. The overall composition is balanced, with the pub representing the earlier hours and the nightclub representing the later hours. The colour palette should be reminiscent of a faded UK flag with pastel hues.
