A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is the desolate, windswept moor of Culloden, depicted in muted, pastel colors, primarily blues, grays, and browns. In the foreground, scattered Highland weaponry—swords, targes (shields), and muskets—lie abandoned, partially submerged in the heather. A lone, tattered tartan banner, predominantly blue and green, lies draped over a broken claymore, symbolizing the defeat of the clans. Rising mist partially obscures the background, creating an atmosphere of loss and fading power. A few dark silhouettes of fleeing figures can be subtly suggested in the distance, their posture conveying defeat and despair. The sky is overcast, with hints of a stormy, turbulent weather, reflecting the tumultuous consequences of the battle. The overall composition should evoke a sense of sorrow and the end of an era. The subtle use of light and shadow to emphasize the scattered weapons and the broken banner, further accentuating the loss of power and influence. The image aims to create a poignant visual representation of the aftermath of the Battle of Culloden, directly linking the event to the decline of the clan system.
