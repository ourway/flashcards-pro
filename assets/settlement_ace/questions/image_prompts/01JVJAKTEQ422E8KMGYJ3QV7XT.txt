A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a vibrant St. David's Day celebration in Wales. The central focus is a young girl, dressed in traditional Welsh costume, including a tall black hat and a red shawl, joyfully pinning a bright yellow daffodil onto her lapel. The daffodil is rendered with exquisite detail, showcasing its delicate petals and trumpet. Behind her, a bustling village square comes alive with activity. Villagers, also in traditional attire, are engaged in various festivities: some are singing in a choir, their mouths open in harmonious song; others are dancing a traditional Welsh folk dance, their movements fluid and graceful. A banner with a dragon, the national symbol of Wales, is prominently displayed above the square. The background features rolling green hills characteristic of the Welsh countryside, dotted with quaint stone cottages. In the foreground, a calendar is subtly placed, with the month of March clearly visible and the 1st of March highlighted with a delicate red heart. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of green, yellow, red, and white, evoking a sense of warmth and celebration. The style should be reminiscent of a classic children's book illustration, emphasizing detail and realism while maintaining a gentle, inviting aesthetic.
