A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a grand, stylized entrance to the Welsh Assembly building. The building should have prominent architectural features reminiscent of modern Welsh design, perhaps incorporating slate and glass. Dominating the foreground, positioned centrally, is a large, ornate bookmark, its design subtly echoing the Welsh flag (red dragon on a green and white field). The bookmark is inserted into a stylized, oversized open book; the pages of the book are subtly textured to resemble parchment. The visible text on the pages is intentionally blurred and illegible, emphasizing the bookmark's importance. The bookmark's tassel is a delicate, interwoven cord in pastel shades of green, white, and red. Soft, diffused light bathes the scene, creating a welcoming and informative atmosphere. The sky above the Welsh Assembly should be a gentle pastel blue, with a few wispy clouds. Around the Assembly, suggest a verdant, rolling Welsh landscape with hints of sheep grazing in the distance, rendered in soft watercolor washes. The overall color palette should be dominated by pastel shades, with the red dragon on the bookmark providing a focal point of vibrant color. The composition should be symmetrical and balanced, drawing the viewer's eye to the bookmark as the central element.
