A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting the province of Ulster as the uppermost section of a large, stylized emerald gemstone. The emerald, rendered in varying shades of lush green, rests upon a bed of heather and thistle, subtly alluding to both Scottish and general UK landscapes. Atop the Ulster section of the emerald, depict a small cluster of thatched-roof cottages in a realistic style, their walls whitewashed and chimneys gently smoking. Figures dressed in simple, historical attire – representing both English and Scottish Protestants – are shown tending small gardens and livestock around the cottages. Use a pastel color palette dominated by greens, blues, and creams. The sky above should be a soft, watercolor wash of light blue, with a few wispy clouds. The overall composition should be peaceful and idyllic, but with a subtle hint of conflict represented by a faint, distant silhouette of soldiers marching towards the cottages, almost imperceptible, to remind the viewer of the historical context of settlement during a time of conflict. The illustration should capture the essence of Ulster as a 'topmost' region, a new beginning on a precious land, and the merging of English and Scottish cultures. The style should lean towards realism, avoiding cartoonish elements, suitable for educational purposes.
