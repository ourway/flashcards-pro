A serene, melancholic watercolor painting depicting a vast field of lit candles at twilight. The scene unfolds across a 16:9 landscape orientation. In the center, a gently rolling green field is densely populated with approximately three thousand flickering candles, their flames casting a warm, orange glow against the cool blues and purples of the dusk sky. The candles are not uniformly placed but clustered in a way that suggests both individuality and shared experience. A winding, almost invisible path meanders through the field, subtly dividing it and hinting at the complex divisions within Northern Irish society. The sky above is a gradient of deep blues fading into lighter pastel purples and pinks near the horizon, reminiscent of a peaceful, hopeful dawn yet to come. The edges of the field are blurred, suggesting an endless expanse of remembrance. The overall tone is somber and reflective, emphasizing the human cost of conflict. The art style should be realistic, hand-drawn watercolor with soft edges and a focus on light and shadow to create depth and emotion. Pastel colours are used to give a sense of calm and respect.
