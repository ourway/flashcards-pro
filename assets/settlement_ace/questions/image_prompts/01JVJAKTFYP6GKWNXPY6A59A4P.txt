A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a pastel color palette (primarily light blues, soft reds, and creams). The composition centers on a map of the United Kingdom, rendered in muted, earthy tones. The island of Great Britain is clearly defined, with topographical details lightly sketched in. Wales, highlighted in a soft, pastel red reminiscent of the Welsh dragon, occupies its geographical location on the western side of the island. Overlaid on the map, but slightly raised above it as if floating, are five stylized figures representing people. These figures are diverse in appearance, suggesting the multicultural nature of the UK. They are arranged close together, centrally located over the UK map, but positioned so that only one of the figures is distinctly and prominently positioned over Wales. The other four figures are spread across England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, yet grouped tightly enough to show a clear visual distinction. The single figure over Wales is slightly larger and has a subtle glow effect around it to draw the eye. The overall impression should be of a cohesive population spread across the UK, with a clear visual emphasis on the proportion residing in Wales. The painting should evoke a sense of geographical accuracy and demographic representation, facilitating easy recall of the 5% statistic.
