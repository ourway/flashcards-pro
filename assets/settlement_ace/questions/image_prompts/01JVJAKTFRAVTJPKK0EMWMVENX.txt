A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a stylized world map with a prominent focus on India, Australia, and Africa. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades, subtly incorporating the red, white, and blue of the UK flag in various elements. The map should be rendered in soft, muted tones, with each continent subtly outlined. Overlaid on these three continents (India, Australia, and Africa), translucent, almost ethereal British flags are gently superimposed, hinting at the influence and presence of the British Empire. These flags should not obscure the underlying map but rather serve as a visual indicator of British control. Delicate watercolor washes should blend the flags with the continents, creating a sense of historical layering. The ocean surrounding the continents should be a calming blend of pastel blues and greens, suggesting tranquility and vastness. A faint, golden sun should emanate from behind the map, symbolizing the era's perceived prosperity and global reach. The composition should be centered, with a 16:9 aspect ratio, ensuring that the central idea of expansion is immediately apparent. The artwork should evoke a sense of historical significance and geographical scale without being overtly political or aggressive. The overall impression should be one of gentle education and visual memorability.
