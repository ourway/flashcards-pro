A watercolour painting in a realistic style, depicting the London skyline under a night sky filled with searchlights and distant explosions. The colour palette should be mainly blues, greys and whites. In the foreground, depict the silhouetted shapes of iconic London buildings such as St. Paul's Cathedral and the Houses of Parliament, partially obscured by smoke. The searchlights crisscross the sky, creating dramatic beams of light against the darkness. Small, orange-yellow bursts of light represent the explosions in the distance, suggesting the widespread bombing. A few strategically placed, stylized silhouettes of people huddled in doorways or shelters add a human element, conveying a sense of fear and resilience. The overall composition should evoke a feeling of tension and historical significance, focusing on the visual impact of the bombing raids. The artwork should be framed to resemble a vintage wartime poster, with a slightly distressed texture to enhance the historical feel. The colour palette should lean towards pastel blue and grey hues, with the orange-yellow explosions providing a stark contrast. The image should avoid any direct depictions of violence or injury, focusing instead on the atmosphere of the event and the resilience of the city.
