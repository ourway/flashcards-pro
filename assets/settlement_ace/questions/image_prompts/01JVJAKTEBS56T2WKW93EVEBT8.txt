A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a somber scene centered on a scaffold in London, 16:9 ratio. The color palette leans towards muted blues, reds, and creams, evoking a sense of historical gravitas and subtly referencing the UK flag. The main subject is the execution of Charles I. The composition focuses on the moment *just before* the execution; Charles I is kneeling at the block, head bowed, with his executioner standing poised, axe raised, but not yet swung. The crowd is visible in the background, a sea of worried faces, some cloaked and hooded, rendered with individual expressions of fear, sorrow, and morbid curiosity. The Tower of London looms in the distant background, a symbol of royal power and imprisonment. A single shaft of light breaks through the clouds, illuminating Charles I, emphasizing his vulnerability. Details are paramount: the texture of the wood of the scaffold, the gleam of the axe blade, the ornate details of Charles I's clothing (dark velvet with lace collar), and the cobblestones beneath the scaffold. The overall feeling should be one of solemnity and historical significance, capturing the gravity of the event without being overly graphic or violent. The focus is not on the act of execution itself, but on the anticipation and the weight of history, so the axe must not be in contact with the neck.
