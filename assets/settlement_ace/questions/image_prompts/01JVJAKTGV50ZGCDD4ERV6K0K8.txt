A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. The Causeway itself is rendered with careful attention to the basalt columns, showcasing their unique hexagonal shapes and varying heights. The surrounding sea is a blend of deep blues and greens, with gentle waves lapping against the rocks. Above the Causeway, spanning the entire 16:9 frame, is a visual representation of deep time. This is achieved through a subtle gradient of pastel colors, transitioning from warm yellows and oranges near the horizon (representing the present) to increasingly cooler blues and purples as the gradient rises into the sky (representing the distant past). Embedded within the cool blue/purple sky, almost imperceptibly, are faint, stylized representations of prehistoric flora and fauna – ancient ferns, early mammals, and perhaps a distant dinosaur silhouette – all rendered in muted tones to emphasize their temporal distance. The overall composition should evoke a sense of immense age and geological scale. The color palette should be predominantly pastel, with accents of UK flag-inspired reds and blues subtly incorporated into the rock formations and sky gradient. The horizon line should be low, emphasizing the vastness of the sky and the deep timeline it represents, reinforcing the concept of "50 million years ago" being an incredibly distant point in history.
