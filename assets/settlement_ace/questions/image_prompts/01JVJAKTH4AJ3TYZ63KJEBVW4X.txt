A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolour-style illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a depiction of the Union Jack flag, meticulously rendered with its distinct red, white, and blue colours in a pastel colour palette. Emanating from behind the flag are three symbolic representations: a red English rose, subtly emerging from behind the St. George's cross; a white Scottish thistle, behind the St. Andrew's cross; and a green Irish shamrock, behind the St. Patrick's cross. To the far side of the flag, slightly faded and separate from the other three, is a golden Welsh daffodil drooping slightly, almost transparent, indicating its absence from the flag's core symbolism. The background is a soft, watercolour wash of light blue, reminiscent of a clear sky. The art style should be realistic but with a gentle, educational feel, avoiding harsh lines or overly stylized elements. The composition should guide the eye to the Union Jack first, then subtly reveal the three represented nations, and finally, the absent daffodil, creating a visual narrative of inclusion and exclusion. The overall impression should be one of historical accuracy and gentle learning.
