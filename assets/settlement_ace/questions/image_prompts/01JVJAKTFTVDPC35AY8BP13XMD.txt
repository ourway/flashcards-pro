A hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting a vibrant Hogmanay celebration in a Scottish village. The scene unfolds at twilight, with the sky painted in soft, pastel shades of blue and pink, reminiscent of a winter sunset. In the center, a group of villagers, dressed in traditional Scottish attire, including kilts and tartan shawls, gather around a large bonfire. Some are dancing to the lively music of a bagpiper, whose instrument is adorned with ribbons in the colors of the Scottish flag (blue and white). Others are engaged in the tradition of "first-footing," carrying symbolic gifts such as coal, shortbread, and whisky. A family is shown rolling a flaming barrel down a gentle slope, representing the burning away of the old year. Houses in the village are decorated with festive lights, and children are depicted with sparklers, their faces lit with joy. The overall atmosphere is one of warmth, community, and the joyous welcoming of the New Year, capturing the essence of Hogmanay. The style should be realistic but with a touch of whimsy, suitable for educational purposes.
