A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a serene English countryside scene. The central focus is a classic village cricket green, bathed in the warm, golden light of a late afternoon sun. The green is perfectly manicured, with cricketers dressed in traditional white uniforms actively engaged in a match. One batsman is poised mid-swing, while fielders are strategically positioned. In the immediate foreground, slightly blurred to create depth, is a meticulously set tea table. A bone china teapot, adorned with a delicate floral pattern in pastel blue and pink, sits alongside cups and saucers. Scones, topped with clotted cream and strawberry jam, are arranged on a tiered serving tray. Behind the tea table, a quintessential English garden unfolds, complete with roses in full bloom, lavender bushes, and a neatly trimmed hedge. A majestic oak tree, its branches reaching towards the sky, stands sentinel in the background. The overall color palette should be dominated by the pastel tones of the English countryside - soft greens, gentle blues, and muted yellows, accented by the bright white of the cricket attire and the vibrant reds of the jam. The art style should be realistic, capturing the essence of a traditional English summer afternoon, with subtle details that evoke a sense of nostalgia and cultural heritage. The composition should lead the eye from the tea table to the cricket match, creating a visual narrative that links the two quintessential English elements.
