A watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a balanced scale in the center of the image. One side of the scale holds a stack of neatly arranged, pastel-colored banknotes, primarily in shades of blue and red to subtly reference the UK flag. The total height of the stack visually represents the concept of 'ten thousand'. The banknotes are slightly crumpled and worn, suggesting everyday transactions and disputes. The other side of the scale features a stylized gavel, symbolizing the legal system and the small claims court. The background is a soft, blurred wash of pastel blues and grays, evoking a sense of calm and justice. The scale is intricately detailed with brass-like accents, lending a touch of traditional British elegance. The scene is bathed in soft, diffused light, creating a sense of fairness and impartiality. The composition emphasizes the balance between financial claims and the legal process, with the scale as the central focal point. The overall art style should resemble a classic watercolor painting found in a legal textbook, using a limited pastel color palette that is both educational and visually appealing. The image should avoid any harsh lines or overly dramatic shading to maintain a sense of approachability and trustworthiness.
