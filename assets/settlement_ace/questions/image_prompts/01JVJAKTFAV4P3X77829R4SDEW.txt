A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style (16:9 ratio). The central focus is a determined woman, depicted from the waist up, wearing a sash in the suffragette colors of purple, white, and green. The sash is draped across her chest. Her expression is resolute but kind. She is holding a suffragette flag with the same colors. The background consists of a soft pastel blue sky with faint, stylized clouds. The woman's clothing is simple but respectable, reflecting the early 20th-century period. Her hair is styled in a classic updo of the era. The artwork should evoke a sense of historical importance and quiet determination, using soft lighting and delicate brushstrokes to create a timeless and respectful portrayal. The color palette should lean towards pastel hues, with the suffragette colors prominently displayed. The composition should be balanced and centered, drawing the viewer's eye directly to the woman's face and her symbolic clothing. The overall effect should be both informative and artistically appealing, suitable for educational purposes.
