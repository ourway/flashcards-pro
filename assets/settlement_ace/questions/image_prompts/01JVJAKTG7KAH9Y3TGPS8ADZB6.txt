A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor illustration in a pastel color palette, depicting a jubilant scene outside a British polling station in 1928. The focal point is a young woman, appearing to be around 21 years old, wearing a stylish cloche hat and a knee-length dress typical of the era. She is smiling radiantly as she proudly drops her ballot into a traditional British ballot box, painted in classic red. The polling station is adorned with subtle bunting in pastel shades of blue, pink, and yellow. Behind her, a diverse group of women of varying ages and backgrounds are also queuing to vote, their faces reflecting hope and determination. The background includes iconic London landmarks faintly sketched in the distance, such as the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben, rendered in soft watercolor washes. Sunlight streams through the scene, casting a warm and optimistic glow. The overall composition should evoke a sense of historical significance and the achievement of equality. The style should be reminiscent of vintage travel posters, with clean lines and a focus on capturing the atmosphere of the time.
