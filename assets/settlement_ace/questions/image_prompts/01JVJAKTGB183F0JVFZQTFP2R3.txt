A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format, predominantly using pastel colours. The central focus features a stage scene, bathed in soft, warm light. On stage, three anthropomorphic lion musicians, dressed in tweed suits reminiscent of British countryside attire, are playing instruments: a guitar, a bass, and drums. Each lion wears a Union Jack waistcoat. This represents Great Britain, the band. To the far right of the stage, a spotlight shines on an empty microphone stand, subtly indicating a missing member. A shamrock, subtly placed near the empty microphone stand, symbolizes Northern Ireland's absence. The backdrop is a muted pastel blue, evoking the sky, and a faint outline of rolling green hills, representative of the British Isles, fades into the horizon. The overall style aims for a gentle, educational aesthetic, reminiscent of classic children's book illustrations. The entire composition is centered, ensuring that the viewer's eye is drawn to the subtle absence and the connection to the 'Great Britain' band not being the 'United Kingdom' supergroup without all its members.
