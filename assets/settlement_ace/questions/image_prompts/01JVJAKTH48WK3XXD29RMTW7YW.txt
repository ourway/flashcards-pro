A meticulously detailed, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting Isaac Newton's groundbreaking experiment with light. The central focus is a clear glass prism, sharply defined and catching the light. A beam of pure, white sunlight enters the prism from the left. As the light passes through the prism, it refracts and disperses, exiting on the right side as a vibrant, full spectrum of rainbow colors. The colors should transition smoothly from red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, to violet, mirroring the natural order of the rainbow. The background should be a soft, slightly textured off-white, reminiscent of high-quality watercolor paper. Subtle, almost imperceptible hints of blue and red pastels can be incorporated into the white background to subtly allude to the UK flag. The lighting should be bright and focused on the prism and the resulting rainbow, with a slight gradient effect to simulate natural sunlight. The style should be reminiscent of classical scientific illustrations, emphasizing accuracy and clarity, with a touch of artistic flair to make it visually engaging. The overall feel should be educational, inspiring, and evocative of scientific discovery.
