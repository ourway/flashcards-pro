A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London, bathed in the soft, diffused light of a cloudy London morning. The Cenotaph should be rendered with precise architectural accuracy, emphasizing its clean lines, Portland stone texture, and subtle carvings. Around the base of the Cenotaph, respectful figures are laying wreaths of poppies, their faces etched with solemn remembrance. The color palette should predominantly feature muted, pastel shades of grey, beige, and off-white to reflect the somber mood and the Cenotaph's stone. Accents of red from the poppies and subtle blues and greys in the sky should provide contrast. In the immediate foreground, subtly include architectural drafting tools - a set square, compass, and rolled-up blueprint - resting on a weathered stone surface. Faintly visible on the blueprint are architectural sketches hinting at the Cenotaph's design, with the barely legible signature "E.L." (for Edwin Lutyens) discreetly placed on the corner of the blueprint. The background should fade softly, suggesting the surrounding government buildings and the distant silhouette of London landmarks, all rendered in a hazy, atmospheric perspective. The overall composition should evoke a sense of national pride, remembrance, and the enduring legacy of architectural vision.
