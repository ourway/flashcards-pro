A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting two distinct scenes seamlessly blended within a 16:9 landscape format. The left half of the image showcases Marston Moor: a vast, open moorland under a turbulent, stormy sky rendered in shades of grey, blue, and muted purples, reminiscent of the UK flag's color palette. Numerous moorhens, painted in realistic detail, are taking flight from the marshy ground, their wings spread wide as if startled by a sudden event. The right half of the image transitions smoothly to represent Naseby field: a gently rolling green landscape dotted with wildflowers in pastel yellows and blues. In the foreground, two opposing armies clash in a miniature, symbolic battle, with tiny figures representing soldiers in 17th-century attire. Their banners, though small, bear heraldic symbols. The overall composition is designed to draw the eye to the center, where the two scenes meet. The watercolor technique should emphasize soft gradients and realistic textures, creating a visually engaging and memorable image that connects the moorhens ('Moor') and the battle scene ('Naseby') to the context of the English Civil War. The art style should avoid cartoonish elements, maintaining a sophisticated and educational aesthetic.
