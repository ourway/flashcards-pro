A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a dramatic yet serene landscape. The focal point is a grand, neoclassical building reminiscent of Stormont, bathed in soft, diffused light breaking through a turbulent, swirling storm cloud directly overhead. The building's architecture is accurately portrayed with its prominent columns and symmetrical design. The storm cloud is rendered with deep blues, purples, and greys, hinting at power and drama, but not threatening, with rays of pastel yellow and white sunlight piercing through, illuminating the building. The surrounding landscape includes rolling green hills typical of Northern Ireland, dotted with sheep. In the foreground, a calm, reflective body of water mirrors the building and the sky, creating a sense of peace amidst the brewing storm. The color palette is dominated by pastel blues, greens, and greys, with accents of gold in the building's details and the sunlight. The overall composition is balanced, with the building centrally placed to draw the viewer's eye, and the storm cloud positioned above to create a visual link between the weather and the location. The style evokes a sense of history and importance, making it memorable. The image is 16:9.
