A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical scientific illustration, depicting a cutaway view of a Watt steam engine in operation. The engine's components – the boiler, piston, condenser, and flywheel – are clearly visible and intricately rendered. Water vapor, subtly tinted in a pastel blue, fills the boiler and flows through the pipes, illustrating the steam's journey and power. The metal of the engine is depicted with shades of grey, silver and black, showing its metallic texture and shine. The background is a muted, pastel-colored representation of a late 18th-century British factory, with simplified depictions of machinery and workers, emphasizing the industrial setting but keeping the focus firmly on the steam engine. The overall color palette should evoke a sense of the past, using muted blues, greys, and browns, with subtle hints of red in the firebox to represent the heat source. The composition centers the steam engine, highlighting its pivotal role, with the factory scene providing context to its impact. The art style aims for clarity and precision, suitable for educational purposes, ensuring each component of the engine is easily identifiable.
