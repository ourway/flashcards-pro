A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a majestic, yet visibly constrained, king. He is adorned in royal regalia, including a crimson robe trimmed with ermine and a golden crown slightly askew on his head, suggesting discomfort. His hands are subtly bound by ornate, symbolic "handcuffs" crafted from intertwined parchment scrolls, representing the Magna Carta. These scrolls are detailed with faint, calligraphic script. The background features a simplified, pastel-colored representation of the Houses of Parliament, rendered in soft blues and greys, indicating the establishment of law and governance. A single, broken golden chain lies at the king's feet, symbolizing the limitations placed upon absolute power. The overall color palette leans towards the hues of the UK flag â€“ primarily reds, whites, and blues, but softened to pastel shades. The composition should evoke a sense of historical significance and the curbing of royal authority, without being overtly aggressive or cartoonish, maintaining an educational and serious tone. The lighting is soft and diffused, highlighting the king's conflicted expression and the symbolic restraints.
