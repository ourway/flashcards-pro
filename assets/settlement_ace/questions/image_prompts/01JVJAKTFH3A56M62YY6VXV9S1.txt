A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format, predominantly using a pastel color palette with subtle hints of red, white, and blue reminiscent of the UK flag. The central focus is a distinguished figure seated in a high-backed, ornate wooden chair within the House of Commons, bathed in soft, natural light filtering through arched windows. The figure, depicted as an ordinary Member of Parliament, is dressed in a simple, dark suit, contrasting with the elaborate setting. He is holding a gavel in his hand. Around the central figure, several other MPs are seated, some looking towards the speaker with respect, others engaged in quiet conversations. The architectural details of the House of Commons should be accurately portrayed, including the green benches, the intricate woodwork, and the overall sense of formality and tradition. The composition should convey a sense of order and authority, with the Speaker as the focal point, yet emphasize his origin as an ordinary MP among his peers. The art style should lean towards realism, capturing the textures of the fabrics and the wood, creating a scene that feels both grand and grounded. The overall tone should be educational and informative, highlighting the role of the Speaker while subtly reinforcing the idea that he is, at his core, an ordinary MP elected to serve.
