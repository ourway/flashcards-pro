A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical watercolor paintings, depicting a stylized but accurate representation of the English Civil War. The composition is centered, adhering to a 16:9 aspect ratio. On the left side, visualize a group of Cavaliers, depicted as noble knights with flowing hair and elaborate, plumed hats, adorned in rich, royal blue and gold attire. They wield swords and ride horses with ornate saddles. Their banner displays a stylized crown. On the right side, illustrate the Roundheads as disciplined soldiers, characterized by their close-cropped haircuts and simple, functional, red-brown uniforms. They carry pikes and muskets, standing firmly in formation. Their banner shows a stylized parliament building. The background showcases a misty English countryside with rolling green hills and a cloudy sky, rendered in soft pastel hues. The art style should evoke a sense of historical gravitas and the contrasting ideologies of the two groups. The overall color palette should lean towards the colors of the UK flag, with a prominent use of red, white, and blue, tempered with earthy tones to represent the landscape and the period. The image is intended to be educational and memorable, helping viewers associate the Cavaliers with King Charles I and the Roundheads with Parliament without using any text.
