A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, resembling a watercolor painting with a pastel color palette. The scene is set in a bright, airy office space. At the center, a friendly-looking employer with neatly combed hair and wearing a light blue button-down shirt is handing a paycheck to an employee. The employee, dressed in a simple white blouse, is smiling gently. The paycheck, rendered in a soft cream color, has a small, stylized downward-pointing arrow subtly indicating a deduction. Radiating outwards from the paycheck are faint, interconnected lines forming a stylized web, symbolizing the National Insurance contributions. In the background, subtly blurred, are other employees working at their desks, maintaining a sense of a professional yet relaxed environment. The color palette should be dominated by pastel blues, creams, and greens, evoking a sense of calm and trustworthiness. The overall composition should be balanced and harmonious, with soft lighting enhancing the realistic watercolor effect. The image should convey the idea that National Insurance is a standard deduction handled by the employer, not the employee. The image ratio is 16:9, with the main action centered.
