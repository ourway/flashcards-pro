A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a Scottish landscape under a stormy, grey sky. The central focus is a broken bagpipe lying on a windswept moor. The bagpipe is intricately detailed, with visible cracks and damage to the wood and fabric, suggesting discord and disarray. The color palette leans heavily on muted blues, greys, and earthy browns, subtly echoing the Scottish flag and a sense of somberness. Around the broken bagpipe, scattered thistle flowers (the national flower of Scotland) are depicted wilting and bent over, symbolizing disagreement and sorrow. In the background, silhouetted against the stormy sky, are faint, ghostly figures of Scottish Highlanders, their heads bowed in disapproval. A single, dark raven perches on a nearby weathered stone, further enhancing the atmosphere of dissent. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of disharmony and refusal, visually representing the Scots' disagreement with the execution of Charles I and the ascension of Charles II. The image should be devoid of any text.
