A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the six counties of Northern Ireland. Imagine a gently rolling, verdant landscape divided into six distinct sections, each representing a county. These sections are subtly separated by winding rivers depicted in shades of blue, mimicking the waterways that delineate the regions. Each county is visually distinguished by unique, yet harmonious elements: one section features a small herd of cows grazing peacefully; another showcases a historical stone tower; a third has fields of flax in bloom, their delicate blue flowers adding a touch of color. A fourth section shows a small fishing boat on a lake. The fifth section should have a golf course. And the sixth section should have a small forest. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel greens, blues, and earthy browns, evoking the natural beauty of the Irish countryside. The sky above is a soft, watercolor wash of pale blue, with gentle cloud formations adding depth. The entire scene is framed within the 16:9 aspect ratio, ensuring the six county sections are the central focus. The style should be reminiscent of vintage travel posters, emphasizing the tranquil and picturesque nature of Northern Ireland.
