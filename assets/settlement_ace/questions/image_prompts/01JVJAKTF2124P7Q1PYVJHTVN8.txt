A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a scene that highlights the distinction between the United Kingdom and its overseas territories. The composition is centered on a detailed, pastel-coloured map of the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) with clear, defined borders. Adjacent to this map, but clearly separated by a stretch of ocean represented in soft, turbulent blues and whites, is a smaller, vividly coloured island representing St Helena. This island features lush, green vegetation and a distinctive, rocky coastline. A miniature British flag flies proudly on St Helena, but it appears smaller and more distant compared to the prominent UK map. The ocean between the UK and St. Helena is populated with historically accurate sailing ships rendered in intricate detail, symbolizing the historical connections and distances between the regions. The sky above is a gentle gradient of pastel blues and pinks, creating a serene and educational atmosphere. The overall colour palette leans towards the pastel versions of colours found in the UK flag (red, white and blue) to subtly reinforce the British connection, while the distinct separation emphasizes that St Helena, though connected, is not geographically part of the United Kingdom.
