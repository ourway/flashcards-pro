A meticulously hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, rendered in a pastel color palette with subtle hints of blue and red reminiscent of the UK flag. The composition is centered, depicting the Stormont building in Belfast, Northern Ireland, its iconic dome subtly illuminated by a soft, diffused light. Before the building, arranged in a semi-circle that mimics the curve of the Assembly chamber, are 108 distinct, individually rendered figures, each representing an elected Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). Each figure should be unique in posture, dress, and general appearance, reflecting the diversity of the Northern Irish population. The figures are not overly detailed, but clearly human and distinguishable. The ground beneath the figures and around the Stormont building is a lush green, representing the landscape of Northern Ireland. The sky is a gentle pastel blue, with soft, watercolor clouds adding depth and texture. The overall feeling should be one of calm representation and democratic process. The scene should avoid any suggestion of conflict or tension, focusing instead on the collective voice of the assembly. The artistic style should evoke a sense of historical record and respect for the institution.
