A vibrant, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a detailed watercolor painting, depicting a lively St. Patrick's Day parade in a Northern Irish town. The scene is set against a backdrop of rolling green hills under a pastel blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The parade's focal point is a group of traditional Irish musicians playing fiddles, flutes, and bodhr√°ns, their faces beaming with joy. They are surrounded by dancers in emerald green costumes, performing a lively jig. The streets are lined with cheerful onlookers, many wearing shamrocks and waving small Irish flags. Buildings along the street are adorned with green banners and decorations, and storefronts display festive window displays. A subtle rainbow arches across the sky in the background, its colors blending softly into the pastel palette. The overall color scheme should incorporate shades of green, white, and orange, echoing the Irish flag, with accents of pastel blues and yellows to create a cheerful and inviting atmosphere. The composition should be balanced, with the parade occupying the central space and the surrounding landscape providing context. The artistic style should evoke a sense of warmth, tradition, and celebration, capturing the spirit of St. Patrick's Day in Northern Ireland.
