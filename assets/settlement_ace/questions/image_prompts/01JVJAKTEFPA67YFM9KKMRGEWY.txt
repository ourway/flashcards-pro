A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the interior of a grand cathedral, bathed in the ethereal glow of sunlight filtering through stained glass windows. The primary focus is on a central, large stained glass window depicting a scene from the Bible: Noah's Ark. Animals, rendered in a pastel colour palette, are peacefully entering the ark under a vibrant rainbow that arches across the sky. To the left of Noah's Ark, another stained glass panel illustrates a scene from the life of a Christian saint â€“ Saint George slaying the dragon, with pastel-coloured armour and a flowing cape. The colours used in both scenes subtly echo the colours of the UK flag (red, white, and blue), with red appearing in Saint George's cape, white in the clouds and animals, and blue in the sky. Sunlight streams through the windows, casting colourful patterns onto the stone floor of the cathedral. The architectural details of the cathedral, including pointed arches and ribbed vaults, are rendered with precision. The overall atmosphere is one of reverence, peace, and the illuminating power of faith, with a clear emphasis on the stories depicted in the stained glass.
