A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic British storybook illustrations, set against a soft, pastel-colored sky. The central focus is Queen Elizabeth II, depicted in her iconic attire: a regal, yet approachable, light blue dress, adorned with subtle floral embroidery, and a delicate diamond tiara. She stands on a slightly elevated platform, covered with a plush, deep red carpet. In front of her, a group of diverse individuals, representing the winning political party, stand attentively. The Prime Minister-elect is positioned slightly forward, holding a symbolic key made of gold, representing the power to govern. The Queen is extending a gloved hand towards the key, as if formally presenting it. The background features a stylized, pastel-colored rendering of the Houses of Parliament, partially obscured by a gentle mist, maintaining focus on the central figures. The overall composition should evoke a sense of solemnity, tradition, and the peaceful transfer of power within the UK's democratic system. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and golds, subtly mirroring the colors of the Union Jack. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a welcoming and dignified atmosphere. The image should be rich in detail, emphasizing the textures of the fabrics, the gleam of the jewelry, and the expressions on the faces of the individuals, all while maintaining a clear and uncluttered composition.
