A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting Queen Elizabeth II in her coronation regalia. She stands centrally framed against the backdrop of Westminster Abbey. The Queen is wearing St. Edward's Crown and holding the Sceptre with the Cross and the Orb. The colors should be primarily pastel blues, reds, and whites, evoking the colors of the Union Jack. Light should be diffused and soft, creating a sense of reverence and history. The background should feature a simplified, yet recognizable interior of Westminster Abbey, with stained-glass windows casting coloured light. Include subtle symbolic elements like doves representing peace subtly incorporated into the stained-glass design. Focus on the Queen's serene and dignified expression. The overall composition should emphasize the Queen's role as a central and powerful figure, suggesting her leadership position. The image should be visually balanced and serene, with the intention of conveying a sense of authority and tradition associated with the British monarchy and its relationship with the Church of England.
