A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting Dame Ellen MacArthur single-handedly sailing a vast, navy blue ocean under a pastel sky. The ocean, rendered in varying shades of blue, should exhibit realistic waves and whitecaps, conveying a sense of both power and serenity. Dame Ellen, positioned in the center of the image, is depicted as determined and focused, expertly maneuvering the sailboat. The sailboat itself is a sleek, modern racing yacht, its white sails billowing in the wind, hinting at speed and precision. The hull of the boat should be a vibrant shade of red, mirroring the UK flag. The sky above should be a soft gradient of pastel blues and pinks, with subtle hints of white clouds suggesting a breezy day at sea. The composition should emphasize the vastness of the ocean and the solitude of the sailor, highlighting the challenge and skill involved in sailing. The overall color palette should evoke a sense of calm and determination, with the red of the hull adding a touch of British pride. The artwork should feel like a page from a classic maritime adventure novel, celebrating the spirit of exploration and the achievements of a celebrated British sportswoman.
