A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style reminiscent of classic historical illustrations, focusing on the Tower of London. The image ratio is 16:9. The colour palette consists of pastel blues, reds and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag. The central focus is a Beefeater, one of the Yeomen Warders, standing guard. He is adorned in his traditional scarlet uniform with gold detailing, holding a halberd. His face is etched with character, hinting at the many stories he could tell. Behind him, the Tower of London rises majestically, showcasing its iconic White Tower and other prominent architectural features. The stones of the Tower are subtly textured to convey their age and history. Around the Beefeater, subtly include elements suggesting the Tower's diverse history: a faint shimmer representing the Crown Jewels locked safely away, and a raven perched nearby, alluding to the legends surrounding the Tower. The composition should emphasize the Beefeater's role as a storyteller and guardian of history, with the Tower serving as a backdrop that speaks volumes about Britain's past. The sky above is a soft, watercolour wash of pastel blue. Avoid any cartoonish or abstract elements. The overall impression should be one of historical accuracy and dignified representation.
