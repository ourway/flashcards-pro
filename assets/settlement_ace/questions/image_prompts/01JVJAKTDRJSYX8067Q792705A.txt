A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a lively concert scene set against the iconic backdrop of the Scottish Highlands. In the center of the image, a stylized stage bursts with energy, featuring musicians silhouetted against a dazzling light display in shades of blue, red, and white, reminiscent of the Union Jack. The crowd is depicted as an impressionistic blend of pastel-colored figures, their arms raised in joyous participation. Dominating the background is a stylized depiction of the Scottish Highlands, with rolling green hills and mist-shrouded peaks, subtly suggesting Scotland's geographical identity. To the left of the stage, and slightly behind it, is a modern architectural structure with a distinctive, curved roof, representing the SECC (Scottish Event Campus), blended with the landscape so it is part of it. The architectural part should be in pastel grey. The overall color palette leans towards soft pastel hues, interspersed with occasional vibrant bursts of color from the stage lighting and the crowd, creating a festive and memorable atmosphere. The style should evoke a sense of cultural celebration and artistic expression, making the image stick in the viewer's mind as a visual cue for Scotland and large event venues. The image should not contain any text or numbers.
