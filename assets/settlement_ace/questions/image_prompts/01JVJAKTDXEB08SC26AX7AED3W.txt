A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting the Battle of Bannockburn. The image, in a 16:9 landscape format, centers on a dramatic clash between Scottish and English forces on a vibrant green field. Scottish soldiers, clad in traditional kilts and wielding claymores, fiercely engage with English knights in shining armor. Robert the Bruce, with a determined expression, is positioned slightly ahead of his troops, leading the charge. The backdrop features a lush Scottish landscape with rolling hills and a clear blue sky, subtly incorporating the colors of the Scottish flag (blue and white). Mud and grass stains the bottom of the soldiers' clothing. The composition should emphasize the chaotic energy of the battle, with dynamic poses and a sense of movement. The colour palette leans towards pastel shades, with muted reds, blues, and greens dominating the scene, avoiding any cartoonish representation. The overall artistic style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and dramatic intensity, ensuring the image serves as a memorable visual aid for recalling the year 1314.
