A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a quaint, traditional British pub nestled in a charming village square. The pub, named "The Crown & Pint," boasts a weathered wooden facade, adorned with blossoming window boxes overflowing with vibrant red geraniums and trailing ivy. The scene is bathed in the warm, gentle light of a late morning sun, casting soft shadows across the cobblestone square. In the foreground, a classic red telephone box stands beside a vintage-style bicycle leaning against the pub's wall. The pub's front door is slightly ajar, revealing a glimpse of a cozy interior with dark wood furnishings and the soft glow of brass fixtures. A chalkboard sign hangs outside, displaying the words "Elevenses Served Here" in elegant cursive. The color palette leans towards the UK flag: deep blues and reds in the flowers and phone box, balanced with the creamy whites and light browns of the pub's architecture. A sense of inviting warmth and community should emanate from the image, evoking the feeling of a friendly local gathering place opening its doors for the day. The overall composition should be balanced and harmonious, drawing the viewer's eye towards the welcoming entrance of the pub and the idea of a late morning social gathering.
