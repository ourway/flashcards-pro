A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a pair of balanced scales. One scale pan contains a stylized, antique British judge's gavel, representing impartiality, rendered in shades of blue and grey to evoke a sense of legal authority and unbiased judgment. The other scale pan holds a shining, multifaceted crystal heart, symbolizing integrity. The heart radiates a soft, pastel pink glow, conveying honesty and moral strength. The scales themselves are crafted from polished wood and accented with subtle gold leaf details. Behind the scales, fading into the background, is a faint outline of the Houses of Parliament, rendered in a complementary pastel blue, subtly suggesting the context of public service. The background should be a soft, gradient wash of pastel blues and whites, resembling a clear, dawn sky. The entire composition should aim for a realistic yet slightly idealized aesthetic, reminiscent of classic British illustrations, emphasizing clarity and conveying a sense of trustworthiness. The color palette should lean towards pastel versions of the UK flag colors (red, white, blue) to reinforce the British context without being overtly patriotic.
