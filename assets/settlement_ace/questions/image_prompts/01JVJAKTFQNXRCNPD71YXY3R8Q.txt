A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style, ratio 16:9. The composition centres on a regal scene, framed with pastel blues and reds reminiscent of the Union Jack. Queen Elizabeth II, depicted in her mature years with a kind, gentle expression, is seated gracefully on an ornate, but not overly extravagant, chair. She wears a simple, elegant dress in a soft, muted blue, and her iconic silver hair is neatly styled. Beside her, standing slightly behind and to her left, is Prince Philip. He is portrayed with a warm, supportive smile, dressed in a smart, dark suit with a subtle red tie. The background is a suggestion of a traditional British garden, with roses in soft pinks and yellows subtly blooming. The colours should be pastel. A gentle light illuminates both figures, emphasizing their calm and enduring presence. The overall tone should evoke a sense of steadfast companionship, duty, and quiet strength. The drawing should be detailed enough to be realistic, but still have the soft feel of watercolour. The focus is on portraying the Queen and Prince Philip in a dignified and respectful manner, capturing their essence as a long-standing couple.
