A hand-drawn, realistic, 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a scene inside a simplified polling station. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues and reds, subtly referencing the UK flag. The central focus is a voting booth, represented by a semi-transparent, light blue curtain partially drawn across the front, suggesting privacy. Inside the booth, only the hands of a voter are visible, holding a pencil poised above a ballot paper. The hands are drawn with careful attention to detail, showing the act of marking the paper in a deliberate, thoughtful manner. The ballot paper itself is mostly obscured, with only a hint of boxes and faint lines visible, emphasizing the secrecy of the vote. Outside the booth, slightly blurred in the background to maintain focus on the booth, are hints of other voting booths and indistinct figures representing other voters. There should be no polling officer in sight, reinforcing the absence of supervision. The overall composition emphasizes the solitude and privacy associated with casting a vote, with soft lighting creating a calm and contemplative atmosphere. The style should avoid caricature, aiming for a realistic yet gentle portrayal.
