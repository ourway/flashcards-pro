A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting depicting the Union Jack, the flag of the United Kingdom, gently waving in a soft breeze. The flag should dominate the center of the 16:9 landscape composition. The red, white, and blue colors should be vibrant yet slightly muted, reminiscent of aged historical documents, painted in pastel colour palette. The flag's fabric should show subtle creases and folds, adding a sense of realism and depth. Behind the flag, a blurred, soft-focus background featuring iconic British landmarks like the Houses of Parliament, Edinburgh Castle, and the Giant's Causeway should be visible, painted in the same watercolor style and pastel colour palette. These landmarks should be subtly integrated, almost dreamlike, to represent the unified nation. The sky above the landmarks should be a soft, pale blue, with a few wispy white clouds, suggesting a calm and peaceful atmosphere. The overall art style should evoke a sense of national pride and historical significance. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a gentle and inviting image. The colour palette should be harmonious, with the red, white, and blue of the flag complementing the soft background colours. The image should be detailed enough to clearly show the layering of the crosses representing England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, reinforcing the concept of unity, without being overly busy or distracting.
