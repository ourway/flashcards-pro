A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration depicting the Welsh National Assembly building, rendered in a realistic style with a pastel color palette. The architectural details of the Senedd are accurately portrayed, emphasizing its modern design and glass facade. Superimposed subtly over the building's main structure is a large clock face, its hands fixed at twelve o'clock. Instead of numbers around the clock face, sixty individual, miniature figures, each representing a member of the Welsh National Assembly, are positioned at each minute mark. These figures are diverse in appearance, reflecting the multicultural nature of Wales. Each figure is distinct, wearing clothing subtly hinting at different professions or backgrounds within Welsh society. The background features a soft, watercolor wash of the Welsh landscape, with rolling green hills and a hint of the coastline in the distance. The overall composition is balanced, with the clock face and assembly building taking central focus, ensuring a clear visual connection between the concept of time and the number of representatives. The artistic style leans towards realism, but with a gentle, painterly quality that makes the image approachable and memorable. The colors are predominantly soft blues, greens, and whites, reminiscent of the Welsh flag, promoting a sense of national identity.
