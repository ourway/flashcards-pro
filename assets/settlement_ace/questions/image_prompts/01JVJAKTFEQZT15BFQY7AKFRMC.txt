A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting two heraldic roses, one white and one red, intertwined and battling for dominance. The white rose, representing the House of York, is depicted with slightly sharper, more angular petals, while the red rose, representing the House of Lancaster, has softer, rounder petals. The roses are not simply placed side by side, but actively engaged; thorns from each rose are subtly piercing the petals of the other, symbolizing the bitter conflict. They are set against a backdrop of a stylized English landscape, with rolling green hills in the distance and a suggestion of medieval castles rendered in soft, pastel blues and greys. The color palette is primarily composed of soft, muted shades of red, white, and green, evoking a sense of historical depth and solemnity. The composition should be centered, with the two roses as the focal point, ensuring they occupy the main area of the 16:9 ratio. Light should softly illuminate the roses, highlighting the intricate details of their petals and thorns, creating a sense of drama and importance. The overall tone should be one of historical significance and the tragic nature of civil war, subtly emphasizing the visual representation of the "Wars of the Roses."
