A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image in a 16:9 landscape format. The scene depicts a quaint, pastel-colored French village in the late 17th century. The village square is partially deserted, with only a few figures remaining. Dominating the background is a grand, yet slightly faded, French church, its doors appearing subtly ajar. A cobblestone road leads away from the village center, towards a distant coastline. Along this road, a small group of figures, dressed in period clothing with simple bundles on their backs, are walking away from the village, their faces etched with a mix of sadness and determination. Their clothing incorporates subtle blues, whites, and reds, reminiscent of the French flag, but in muted, pastel tones. In the foreground, a discarded Huguenot cross pendant lies on the cobblestones, symbolizing the persecution they faced. The overall color palette uses soft blues, whites, and reds, with touches of lavender and muted gold, creating a melancholic yet hopeful atmosphere. The art style should be realistic, evoking a sense of historical accuracy and emotional depth, but avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements. The composition should draw the eye towards the departing figures, emphasizing the exodus of the Huguenots from France.
