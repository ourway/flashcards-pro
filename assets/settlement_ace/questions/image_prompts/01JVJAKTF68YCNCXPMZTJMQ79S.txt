A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the interior of the House of Lords. The scene is bathed in soft, pastel hues of blue, pink, and cream. Dominating the composition is the Lord Chancellor's Woolsack, rendered with intricate detail, showcasing its woolly texture. Around the Woolsack, Lords are seated, wearing traditional scarlet robes, their faces individually characterized to suggest diverse backgrounds and ages. Instead of holding traditional documents or scrolls, one of the lords is holding a large letter 'L' made of gold. The backdrop features the ornate, gothic architecture of the House of Lords, including stained-glass windows with heraldic symbols and dark wood panelling. The overall composition should convey a sense of tradition, history, and unelected authority. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a calm and respectful atmosphere. The painting style should be reminiscent of classic British portraiture, focusing on accurate representation and subtle details. No text or numbers should be included in the image. The image should be 16:9 landscape.
