A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a stately, classical-style scales of justice, rendered in muted gold tones. One side of the scale holds a stack of documents, each subtly embossed with symbols of various professions (a caduceus for medicine, a cogwheel for engineering, a quill for writing), representing diverse skills and merit. The other side of the scale features a single, perfectly balanced feather, symbolizing impartiality and fairness. Soft light emanates from behind the scales, casting a gentle glow. Behind the scales, a stylized, simplified silhouette of the Houses of Parliament can be seen, depicted in pastel blues and greys. Subtly woven into the background are faint, almost imperceptible patterns resembling a fingerprint, symbolizing individual identity and merit. The overall colour palette should lean towards pastel blues, creams, and soft golds, evoking a sense of trustworthiness and neutrality. There are no political symbols or colours associated with specific parties and the scales of justice are balanced. The image should convey a sense of calm, order, and the importance of unbiased judgment.
