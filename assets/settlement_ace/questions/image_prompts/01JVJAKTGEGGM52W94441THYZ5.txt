A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor painting in a realistic style, rendered in a pastel color palette. The scene depicts a serene, idealized landscape reminiscent of the Garden of Eden, nestled within the Scottish Highlands. Rolling green hills dotted with heather give way to majestic, mist-shrouded mountains in the background. Dominating the center of the composition is a grand, stylized apple tree, its branches laden with ripe, glowing apples. Beneath the tree, instead of Adam and Eve, are symbolic representations of Scottish culture: a meticulously drawn bagpipe resting against the trunk, a finely detailed thistle plant flourishing at its base, and a subtle tartan pattern woven into the grassy foreground. Rising above the landscape, towards the top center of the image, is a faint, ethereal crown, symbolizing the capital city. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peace, history, and the natural beauty of Scotland. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a dreamlike atmosphere. The horizon line is low, emphasizing the height of the mountains and the vastness of the landscape. The color palette should consist primarily of soft greens, blues, purples, and creams, creating a calming and visually appealing image.
