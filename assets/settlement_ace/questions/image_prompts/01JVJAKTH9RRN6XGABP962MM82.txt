A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour painting in a realistic style, depicting a split scene, symbolizing England and Wales on one side and Scotland and Northern Ireland on the other. The left side, representing England and Wales, features a vibrant, bustling marketplace scene set against the backdrop of rolling green hills dotted with quaint cottages. St. George's flag subtly adorns a market stall selling roses (symbolic of England), while a traditional Welsh dragon banner hangs slightly faded in the background, partially obscured by the lively crowd. People are depicted working diligently, with no indication of a holiday; a sense of everyday life prevails. In contrast, the right side, representing Scotland and Northern Ireland, showcases a serene landscape under a clear sky. A bagpiper stands proudly in a field of thistles (symbolic of Scotland), while a group of people joyfully dance an Irish jig near a field of shamrocks (symbolic of Northern Ireland). The Scottish Saltire and the St. Patrick's flag gently flutter in the breeze. The atmosphere is relaxed and festive, suggesting a day of celebration and leisure. The colour palette should predominantly consist of pastel shades of blue, green and white, accented with the red of the St. Georgeâ€™s flag and the green of the Irish shamrocks. The overall composition should emphasize the contrast between the working atmosphere of England and Wales and the celebratory atmosphere of Scotland and Northern Ireland, visually reinforcing the concept of public holidays versus regular working days.
