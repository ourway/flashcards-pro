A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a watercolor painting, displaying a St. Patrick's Cross. The composition is set against a soft, pastel blue background, subtly hinting at the sky. The cross itself is the central focus, depicted as a vibrant, diagonal red cross, akin to the shade of ripe British strawberries, boldly placed over a pure white rectangular ground. The white ground should occupy most of the image, with the red cross prominently displayed in the center, ensuring clear visibility and emphasis. The lines of the cross should be clean and precise, but with a slight hand-drawn imperfection to maintain the artistic feel. The overall aesthetic should evoke a sense of calm and clarity, avoiding any harsh contrasts or distracting elements. The pastel color palette, primarily blues, reds, and whites, aims to create a visually appealing and memorable image. The image ratio is 16:9, with the subject matter mainly in the center of the image.
