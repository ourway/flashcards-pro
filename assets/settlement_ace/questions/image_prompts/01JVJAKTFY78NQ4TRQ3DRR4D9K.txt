A whimsical, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a charming Scottish village nestled in a snow-dusted valley at twilight. Dominating the central composition is a large, intricately designed clock tower, its face illuminated with a warm, inviting glow. The clock hands are positioned just before midnight. Silhouettes of villagers, rendered in shades of deep blue and purple, are gathered in the town square below the clock tower. They are holding sparklers that emit trails of soft, pastel-colored light â€“ primarily reds, whites, and blues reminiscent of the Union Jack. Some villagers are raising toasting glasses, while others embrace in celebratory hugs. In the background, snow-covered mountains rise majestically, their peaks subtly highlighted with the pink and orange hues of the setting sun. The sky is a gradient of deep blues and purples, sprinkled with twinkling stars. A faint, ethereal mist hangs in the valley, creating a sense of magic and anticipation. The overall atmosphere is one of joy, hope, and the welcoming of a new beginning. The buildings in the village should be traditional Scottish architecture, made of stone and slate roofs.
