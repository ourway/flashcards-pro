A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, focusing on a public square scene in a generic UK town. The color palette primarily utilizes pastel shades with subtle hints of red, white, and blue to evoke the UK flag without being overtly patriotic. The central focal point is a figure standing beneath a clearly marked "No Smoking" sign, depicted as a simple red circle with a line through a cigarette. Wisps of smoke are delicately rendered, curling upwards from the lit cigarette held by the figure. Around the figure, other people are present: a family with young children, an elderly couple, and a business person on a phone, all subtly recoiling or expressing discomfort through their body language â€“ a slight cough, a hand waving away the smoke, a frown. The background features classic UK architectural elements: a red telephone box, a glimpse of a traditional pub with hanging flower baskets, and cobblestone paving. The overall composition should convey a sense of everyday life disrupted by the act of smoking in a prohibited area, highlighting the social impact and the breach of regulations. The sky is overcast, typical of UK weather, rendered in soft grey and white washes. The illustration should avoid any cartoonish or abstract elements, aiming for a realistic portrayal of the scenario with a focus on clear visual communication.
