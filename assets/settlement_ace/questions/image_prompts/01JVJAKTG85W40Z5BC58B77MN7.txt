A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style, depicting a grand, ornate throne room in Whitehall Palace. The colour palette leans heavily on pastel shades of blue, red, and cream, subtly referencing the Union Jack. The focal point is a regal throne, bathed in soft light streaming through tall, arched windows. On the throne sits a meticulously rendered King Charles II, with his iconic dark curly wig and royal attire. He holds a sceptre in one hand and a royal orb in the other. To the left of the throne, a broken, discarded papal tiara lays on the floor, symbolizing the rejection of Catholicism as the state religion. To the right, a banner displaying the royal coat of arms flutters gently. The overall composition evokes a sense of stability and renewed authority. The floor is covered in an intricate geometric pattern of blue and red tiles. The background features detailed architectural elements of Whitehall Palace, including Corinthian columns and arched doorways. The light should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of historical authenticity. The image should convey the idea of restoring the monarchy, not religion, in a visually memorable way.
