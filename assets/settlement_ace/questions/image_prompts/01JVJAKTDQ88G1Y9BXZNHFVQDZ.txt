A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, set against a soft, pastel blue background. The scene focuses on two primary elements: a stylized pub interior on the left and a park scene on the right. The pub interior depicts a bartender with a concerned expression, reaching across a wooden bar towards a young person whose face is partially obscured by shadows. The young person is attempting to purchase a pint of beer. Subtle details like a partially visible ID card slipping from their grasp hint at their underage status. On the right side, the park scene features a group of teenagers gathered around a picnic blanket. One adult figure is handing a bottle of beer to one of the teenagers, who looks hesitant. The overall color palette should lean heavily on pastel shades of red, white, and blue, subtly referencing the UK flag without being overtly patriotic. A soft, diffused light bathes the entire scene, creating a sense of quiet tension and emphasizing the gravity of the depicted actions. The composition should guide the viewer's eye from left to right, highlighting the contrast between the illegal sale and the illegal procurement of alcohol for minors. The pub should showcase traditional British design elements, while the park scene should reflect a typical UK park setting. The intention is to create a memorable visual association between these actions and their criminal status, using a realistic yet artistically rendered style.
