A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor illustration in a pastel color palette (primarily blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag), depicting a stylized polling station scene. The central focus is a vibrantly colored, slightly oversized poll card floating gently in the air, acting as a compass needle pointing towards the entrance of a quaint, traditional British polling station. The polling station is represented by a charming village hall, complete with a Union Jack flag subtly adorning its roof. The poll card itself is illustrated with delicate details: a faint, ornate border, a miniature depiction of the Houses of Parliament in the background, and a small, stylized pencil hovering over a ballot box, symbolizing the act of voting. The sky above is a soft, pastel blue with fluffy white clouds. A winding cobblestone path leads from the foreground to the polling station, suggesting a journey to participate in democracy. The overall composition should evoke a sense of civic duty, accessibility, and the importance of voting, all while maintaining a light and inviting aesthetic. The scene is framed within a 16:9 aspect ratio, with the main elements centered to draw the viewer's eye.
