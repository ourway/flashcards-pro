A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a stack of British banknotes, artistically arranged to showcase various denominations. Dominating the scene is a prominently displayed £5 note featuring Queen Elizabeth II, rendered with delicate brushstrokes to capture her regal likeness. Beside it, a £10 note with Charles Darwin is depicted, emphasizing his contribution to science with subtle botanical details in the background. A £20 note showing Adam Smith is included, with faint imagery of factories and economic activity in the backdrop to symbolize his economic theories. A £50 note featuring Alan Turing is also visible, with binary code subtly integrated into the background. Conspicuously placed atop this stack is a fictional "£25" note, distinctively designed with a whimsical, fantastical creature – perhaps a griffin or a unicorn – instead of a historical figure. The color palette leans towards pastel hues, with occasional vibrant pops of color reminiscent of the UK flag, such as reds and blues, accentuating key elements. The banknotes should look slightly worn and used, giving them a sense of authenticity. The background is a soft, blurred wash of neutral tones, ensuring the banknotes remain the focal point. The overall composition is designed to be visually appealing and educational, creating a memorable mnemonic for the viewer to associate the £25 note with something imaginary and thus easily remember that it is not a real denomination.
