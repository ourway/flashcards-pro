A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style. The scene depicts a bustling British polling station, bathed in the soft, diffused light of a typically overcast London day. Dominating the foreground is a classic red British telephone box, slightly weathered and adorned with a stylized, royal blue "Vote Here" sign in white lettering. Emerging from the telephone box is a line of diverse UK nationals, each character rendered with distinct facial features and dressed in contemporary clothing, reflecting the multicultural fabric of British society. They are all holding stylized ballot papers, each marked with a prominent "X" in a box. In contrast, slightly set back and subtly blurred, stand several EU citizens looking longingly at the polling station with sad expressions on their faces. Each of them is holding a ballot paper with a bold red "NO" symbol superimposed on it. The background features iconic London landmarks such as the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben, rendered in soft pastel hues. The overall color palette should lean towards the blues and reds of the Union Jack, with accents of muted gold and soft grey to evoke a sense of British heritage and solemnity. The composition should emphasize the division between those who can and cannot vote, using depth of field and subtle color variations to guide the viewer's eye and reinforce the message of exclusion. The style is reminiscent of classic British book illustrations, aiming for a timeless and educational appeal.
