A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic, 2D watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The colour palette should primarily use pastel shades, subtly incorporating the red, white, and blue of the UK flag where appropriate. The central focus is a split scene depicting two distinct horse-racing events. On the left side, illustrate Royal Ascot: elegant, slender thoroughbreds with jockeys in vibrantly coloured silks racing on a lush green course. The stands are filled with spectators in formal attire, with ladies wearing elaborate hats. The atmosphere is one of refined elegance and tradition. On the right side, portray The Grand National: a powerful, muscular horse and rider clearing a formidable fence at Aintree Racecourse. The fence should be realistically rendered with mud and splashes of water. The background shows a large crowd of excited spectators. The overall composition should convey the contrast between the aristocratic elegance of Royal Ascot and the thrilling, challenging nature of The Grand National. The sky above should be a soft, watercolour wash of pastel blues and whites, suggesting a bright, overcast day in the UK. The image should be detailed enough to capture the textures of the horses' coats, the fabric of the jockeys' silks, and the greenery of the racecourses, but avoid any text or numbers. The whole image should be clear and focused, to provide a memorable visual aid for remembering the two horse-racing events.
