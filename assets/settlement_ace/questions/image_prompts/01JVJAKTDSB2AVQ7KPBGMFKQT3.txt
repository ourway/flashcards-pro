A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting the Palace of Westminster bathed in the soft, early morning light. The colour palette should primarily use pastel colours, evoking a sense of calm and importance. The composition is centered on the iconic clock tower, Big Ben, with its face subtly displaying the time as 6:00 AM, and using this to represent the age of 18 by using the numbers 18 in 6 + 6 + 6. In the foreground, a young woman (age 18) stands confidently on the steps leading to the Houses of Parliament. She is dressed in a smart, but not overly formal, business suit. She is holding a rolled-up document (representing the manifest), but it's subtle enough not to draw too much attention. The background features a soft, blurred view of the River Thames and the London Eye. The sky is a blend of pastel blues and pinks, suggesting a hopeful and bright future. The overall mood should be aspirational and empowering, visually linking youth and political participation within the framework of British tradition and governance. The image should avoid any cartoonish elements.
