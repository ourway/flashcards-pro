A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical painting. The scene is set on a slightly elevated vantage point overlooking the Battle of Waterloo. The focal point is Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, astride a majestic white horse, "Copenhagen". Wellington is depicted as a strong, determined figure, clad in a scarlet military uniform with gold braiding and a black bicorne hat. His gaze is fixed on the distant battlefield, a landscape of smoke, cannons, and charging soldiers. The horse is posed dynamically, with one foreleg slightly raised, conveying a sense of controlled power. In the background, the chaotic battle unfolds, with the British and allied forces holding their ground against the French Imperial Guard. The sky above is a dramatic mix of blues and greys, suggesting the intensity of the conflict. Subtle details, like Wellington's steely eyes and the dirt smudges on his uniform, add to the realism. The color palette should subtly resemble the UK flag using reds, blues, and whites, with earthy tones dominating the battlefield. The overall composition should be balanced, drawing the eye towards Wellington as the central figure of triumph and resilience. The style should evoke the grand historical paintings of the 19th century, with attention to accurate details in uniforms, weaponry, and landscape. No text should be present in the image.
