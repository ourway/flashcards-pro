A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, focusing on a split composition within a 16:9 landscape format. The left side depicts a young Mary, Queen of Scots, as an infant of about a week old, swaddled in royal blue and white cloth reminiscent of the Scottish flag, lying in a richly decorated cradle. The cradle is adorned with thistle motifs and Scottish heraldry. Soft, diffused light illuminates her face, conveying innocence and vulnerability. The background is a blurred, regal Scottish castle interior with tapestries and stone walls. The right side of the composition transitions smoothly to a scene depicting a slightly older Mary, around the age of 10, dressed in elegant French court attire of pastel blue and white. She is standing in a lush, sun-drenched French garden, perhaps near the Palace of Fontainebleau. French lilies are subtly incorporated into the garden's design. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel blues, whites, and golds, creating a gentle and educational atmosphere. The composition should emphasize the contrast between her Scottish heritage and her French upbringing, visually representing the two key aspects of her early life, with emphasis on her young age when she became Queen.
