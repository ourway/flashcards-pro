A vibrant, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting Mary Peters triumphantly crossing the finish line at the 1972 Olympics pentathlon. She is wearing a white athletic uniform with the UK flag colours subtly incorporated as stripes on the sides. The background features a stylized rendition of the Olympic stadium rendered in soft pastel shades, with a hint of a Northern Irish landscape visible in the far distance. A golden laurel wreath is placed on her head, symbolizing her victory. Emerging from the laurel wreath is a shimmering, ethereal representation of a Dame's insignia, subtly suggesting the honor she would later receive. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the UK flag. The composition should emphasize Mary Peters' strength and determination, with dynamic brushstrokes conveying motion and energy. The image should evoke a sense of historical achievement and the enduring legacy of her contributions to sports and tourism in Northern Ireland. The sky above the stadium should be a soft, watercolour wash of pastel blue, transitioning to a slightly warmer tone near the horizon.
