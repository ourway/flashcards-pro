A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, Scotland, bathed in the soft, late afternoon light. The palace should be rendered in a realistic style, showcasing its architectural details with precision. In the foreground, slightly offset from the center, a partially opened, ornate wooden chest rests on a cobblestone path. Emerging from the chest is a scroll, unfurling towards the viewer. The scroll is emblazoned with the year "1997" in elegant, calligraphic numerals, highlighted with a touch of gold leaf. Next to the chest, a thistle, the national flower of Scotland, grows vibrantly, its purple hues contrasting against the muted tones of the stone path. Behind the palace, the iconic silhouette of Arthur's Seat rises majestically against a pastel sky, transitioning from a gentle blue at the horizon to a soft pink overhead. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades, punctuated by the rich purples of the thistle and the gold accents on the scroll, evoking a sense of historical significance and Scottish national identity. The composition should guide the viewer's eye from the year on the scroll to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, subtly emphasizing the historical context of the Scottish Parliament's re-establishment.
