A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting the Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh, bathed in the soft glow of a morning sunrise. The architectural details of the building are rendered with precision, highlighting its Scottish Baronial style. Emanating from the building is a vibrant, swirling mist of pastel-colored ideas, visually representing the legislation it can pass. The mist is predominantly blue and white, subtly referencing the Scottish flag. This vibrant mist gently flows outwards, but is partially contained by a strong, yet elegant, border representing the reserved powers of the UK Parliament. This border is depicted as a wrought-iron fence, painted in a muted red, and adorned with subtle symbols of the UK, such as miniature roses, thistles, and shamrocks subtly intertwined within the ironwork. The overall composition should emphasize the freedom and scope of the Scottish Parliament's legislative power within the defined framework of the UK constitution. The sky above the Parliament building should transition from a soft pink at the horizon to a gentle blue, contributing to the overall sense of calm and authority. The artistic style should be realistic yet with a touch of whimsy, making it memorable and engaging.
