A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant, stylized Tudor rose in full bloom. The rose is centrally positioned against a soft, diffused background of pastel blues and greens, reminiscent of a misty English garden. The rose's petals exhibit a gradient from a deep crimson at the heart to a delicate blush pink at the edges, capturing the flower's delicate texture and form. Subtle dewdrops glisten on the petals, enhancing the realism. Emerging from behind the rose, partially obscured but distinctly visible, are elements evoking English heraldry: a section of a polished silver shield bearing a faint impression of the three lions passant guardant, and the tip of a royal standard flag displaying the same rose emblem, subtly integrated to avoid direct textual representation. The colour palette leans towards pastel tones, with strategic use of reds, blues, and whites to subtly echo the UK flag. The overall composition is designed to be visually striking and memorable, creating a strong association between the rose and the essence of England. The artwork should evoke a sense of history, elegance, and national pride.
