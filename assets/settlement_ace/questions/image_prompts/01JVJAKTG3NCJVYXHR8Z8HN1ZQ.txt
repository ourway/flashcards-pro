A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style, depicting a contrasting scene of 19th-century life in Ireland versus the rest of the UK. The image, formatted in a 16:9 landscape ratio, is divided into two distinct visual sections. The left side of the image showcases the Irish countryside: a muted, pastel-toned landscape under a slightly overcast sky. A small, thatched-roof cottage with visible signs of disrepair stands in the foreground, surrounded by a barren field with sparse crops. A figure, dressed in simple, worn clothing, is tending to the field, their posture suggesting hardship and struggle. Subtle details, such as a cracked window in the cottage and patches on the figure's clothing, emphasize the challenging living conditions. The right side of the image presents a contrasting scene of the British countryside. A vibrant, rolling green landscape is bathed in warm sunlight. A grand, stone manor house stands prominently, surrounded by well-maintained gardens and grazing livestock. Figures in comparatively finer attire are seen strolling leisurely through the gardens, their relaxed demeanour reflecting a more prosperous life. The colour palette on this side is brighter and more saturated, using pastel blues, greens, and yellows, to create a sense of well-being and abundance. The composition should clearly highlight the disparity between the two scenes, with the dividing line subtly suggesting a geographical boundary. The overall artistic style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy while maintaining a delicate and aesthetically pleasing watercolour aesthetic.
