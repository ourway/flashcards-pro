A heartwarming, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a Father's Day scene. The image, in a 16:9 landscape ratio, features two young children, a boy and a girl, centered in the frame. The boy, around 6 years old, is carefully handing a handmade card to his father. The card is decorated with colorful crayon drawings of hearts and stick figures. The girl, around 8 years old, stands next to her brother, presenting a small, wrapped gift to her father. The wrapping paper is pastel blue and tied with a white ribbon. The father, a kind-looking man in his early 40s, kneels down to their level, smiling warmly. He is wearing a casual shirt and jeans. The background is a cozy living room with pastel-colored walls and soft, natural light streaming in from a window. A vase of sunflowers sits on a nearby table. The overall color palette leans towards the pastel colors of the UK flag â€“ soft blues, reds, and whites. The scene is filled with love and affection, emphasizing the simple yet meaningful gifts exchanged on Father's Day. The composition should be balanced and visually appealing, drawing the viewer's eye to the central interaction between the father and his children. The style should be reminiscent of classic children's book illustrations, with gentle shading and attention to detail in the expressions and gestures of the figures.
