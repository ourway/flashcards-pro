A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a regal but concerned-looking King, dressed in traditional medieval royal attire of crimson and gold, partially inside an ornate, antique wooden box. The box is embellished with subtle carvings reminiscent of 13th-century English art. The king's upper body and head are visible, suggesting confinement rather than full enclosure. The box is labeled with a stylized scroll bearing the suggestion of writing, subtly implying the Magna Carta. The background features a muted, rolling green English countryside under a pastel blue and white sky, hinting at the kingdom over which the King presides but is now constrained. The color palette leans heavily on the red, white, and blue of the UK flag, with accents of gold to signify royalty. The composition is centered, drawing the viewer's eye to the King and the box, emphasizing the concept of limited power. Soft, diffused lighting creates a sense of historical gravity and underscores the Magna Carta's significant impact on royal authority.
