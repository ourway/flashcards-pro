A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh under a partially cloudy sky. The building is rendered with architectural precision, showcasing its modern design juxtaposed against the historic backdrop of Edinburgh. Dominating the foreground is a stylized, ornate Scottish thistle, its purple flowers and thorny leaves rendered with careful detail. However, a section of the thistle's stem is depicted as being "cut off" or incomplete, visually symbolizing the limited legislative powers of the Scottish Parliament. The colors should primarily be in a pastel colour palette, with soft blues and grays in the sky and building, and muted purples and greens in the thistle. A faint, almost ethereal representation of the British Parliament building (Palace of Westminster) should be visible in the far background, subtly suggesting the reserved powers held by the UK Parliament. The composition should focus on the thistle and the Scottish Parliament building in the center, with the British Parliament building as a distant, secondary element, reinforcing the idea of devolved but not absolute power. The overall mood is serene and informative, aimed at creating a memorable visual association between the thistle, the Scottish Parliament, and the concept of limited legislative authority.
