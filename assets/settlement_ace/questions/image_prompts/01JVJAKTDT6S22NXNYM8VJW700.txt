A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor painting depicting a grand, yet slightly whimsical, architectural scene. The composition is centered, adhering to a 16:9 aspect ratio. The primary subject is a sturdy, stylized brick wall ("Wall"-pole), constructed using bricks of various pastel blues, reds, and whites. This wall serves as the foundation and support for a classical-style British government building, rendered in soft pastel yellows and creams, sitting atop it. The wall is visually composed of 'poles' of timber which go along the brick wall, reinforcing it. The scene is bathed in soft, diffused sunlight, casting gentle shadows that enhance the depth and texture of the brickwork. The overall style should evoke a sense of historical importance and stability, reminiscent of classic British architectural illustrations. The sky is a pale, watercolor wash of blue, with a few scattered, fluffy white clouds. The foreground features a neatly manicured lawn, adding to the scene's overall serenity and order. The color palette should be primarily pastel colors, emphasizing the UK flag colors. The style should be realistic, not cartoonish, and evoke a sense of traditional British artistry.
