A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a cutaway view of a prototype jet engine in the 1930s, predominantly in pastel blue, red, and white, reminiscent of the UK flag. The engine's internal components are intricately rendered, showcasing the complex network of turbines and combustion chambers. Emanating from the rear of the engine is a powerful, stylized burst of orange and yellow flames, suggesting the immense power generated. The engine rests on a workbench cluttered with period-appropriate tools such as spanners, calipers, and blueprints. The blueprints are partially visible, revealing technical diagrams of the jet engine design. Hovering ethereally above the workbench is a subtle, stylized portrait of a young Sir Frank Whittle, his expression a mix of determination and visionary inspiration. The background subtly fades into a blue sky, punctuated by a few wisps of cloud, hinting at the future of aviation. The overall composition should evoke a sense of innovation and the dawn of the jet age, clearly associating the jet engine with the 1930s and Sir Frank Whittle rather than the 1890s and Robert Watson-Watt. The lighting is soft and diffused, highlighting the textures of the metal and paper, and contributing to the educational yet artistic feel of the image.
