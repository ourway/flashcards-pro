A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a medieval Welsh landscape transitioning into English control in the 15th century. The composition is divided into two distinct halves, split vertically down the 16:9 frame. On the left, a vibrant, verdant Welsh valley is shown. Rolling hills dotted with traditional Welsh longhouses with thatched roofs are visible. People in Welsh traditional clothing are farming and tending sheep. A proud Welsh dragon banner flies atop a stone tower. The overall color palette on this side is dominated by greens, earthy browns, and the deep red of the dragon banner. On the right side of the image, the landscape gradually transforms. The Welsh longhouses give way to more structured, English-style timber-framed buildings. The rolling hills become more manicured fields. Figures in English attire are overseeing the land. A flag bearing the English lion replaces the Welsh dragon. The color palette on this side incorporates cooler blues and greys, contrasting with the warmth of the Welsh side. A subtle mist hangs in the valley, visually separating the two halves and suggesting a transition in time and power. The overall tone is melancholic, reflecting the end of Welsh independence. The sky above is a pastel gradient, transitioning from a fiery sunset on the Welsh side to a cooler, grey dawn on the English side.
