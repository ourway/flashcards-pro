A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor painting in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic British educational illustrations. The scene is set against a soft, pastel blue background, evoking a sense of calm and impartiality. The central focus is a large, ornate set of weighing scales, symbolizing justice and balance. One side of the scale is filled with a diverse array of miniature figures, each representing a different voter, all slightly different in appearance, clothing, and color, symbolizing the diverse population of Northern Ireland. This side is labeled metaphorically with a small, stylized four-leaf clover, symbolizing Northern Ireland. The other side of the scale features miniature seats in a parliament, each seat occupied by a figure proportional in number to the figures on the opposite side. The parliamentary seats are rendered in muted red tones, echoing the red in the Union Jack. The scales are perfectly balanced, illustrating the concept of proportional representation. The style should lean towards a realistic, detailed aesthetic, with a focus on capturing the textures of the clothing, the metal of the scales, and the overall atmosphere of fairness. The light should be soft and diffused, highlighting the details of the scene without creating harsh shadows. The overall composition should convey a sense of equilibrium and fairness, visually reinforcing the concept of proportional representation.
