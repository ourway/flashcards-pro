A hand-drawn 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting the iconic Number 10 Downing Street door in London. The door is slightly ajar, with bright, warm light emanating from within. In front of the door, a symbolic iron gate, intricately designed with floral patterns representing the four nations of the UK (rose, thistle, daffodil, shamrock), is visibly shattered. The broken pieces of the gate are scattered on the doorstep. Stepping through the doorway is a silhouette of a woman in a classic power suit, her figure strong and confident. The background features a soft, pastel-colored cityscape of London, with recognizable landmarks like Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament subtly visible. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, pinks, and yellows, reminiscent of a sunrise, to convey a sense of dawn and new beginnings. The light should be focused on the doorway and the woman's silhouette, creating a focal point that symbolizes the breaking of barriers and the entry into a new era. The style should evoke a sense of history, progress, and the empowerment of women in British society.
