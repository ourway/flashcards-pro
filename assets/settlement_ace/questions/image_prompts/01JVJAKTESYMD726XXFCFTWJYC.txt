A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting three distinct landscapes subtly blended. The central focus is a serene Scottish Highland scene, complete with rolling green hills, a loch reflecting a pastel blue sky, and a lone, ancient stone church on a small rise. To the left, seamlessly merging into the Highland scene, is a depiction of the American countryside, featuring rolling fields of wheat under a vast, open sky with a quaint white church nestled amongst the fields. To the right, a suggestion of the White Cliffs of Dover fades into the Scottish landscape, topped by a small, classic English village church with a red tile roof. A stylized, ornate compass rose is subtly overlaid on the entire scene, with the cardinal directions marked: "N" points towards the Scottish Highlands, "W" towards the White Cliffs of Dover, "E" (emphasized with a slightly larger size and a soft, golden glow) points towards the American countryside, and "S" towards the bottom of the frame. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, greens, and yellows, with the red of the English church roof providing a subtle contrast. The entire image should evoke a sense of peace, history, and geographical connection. The emphasis is on the "E" of the compass, symbolizing the "Episcopal" church and its connection to Scotland and the US.
