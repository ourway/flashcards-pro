A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a medieval scene. The central focus is on a learned-looking Scottish man, John Barbour, seated at a wooden writing desk inside a stone-walled study. He's dressed in dark, scholarly robes, a quill pen held delicately in his right hand as he intently writes on parchment. Light streams in from a high, arched window, illuminating his focused expression and the details of his workspace.

To the left of Barbour, visualize a stylized depiction of the Battle of Bannockburn, rendered in miniature like an illuminated manuscript illustration. Knights clash, banners wave (Scottish Saltire prominent), and the landscape reflects the rugged Scottish terrain. To the right, subtly include barber tools – a comb, a straight razor (safely sheathed), and a small shaving bowl – resting on a shelf filled with books. These are not the main focus but are subtly present to act as a visual mnemonic for "Barbour."

The color palette should lean towards muted blues, reds, and browns reminiscent of the UK flag and Scottish landscapes, with accents of gold to highlight the importance of the manuscript and the battle. The overall composition aims to convey a sense of historical accuracy, scholarly dedication, and the enduring legacy of Barbour's work. The background should be slightly blurred to keep the focus on Barbour and his writing, but rich enough to provide context. The scene should evoke a sense of reverence for history and literature.
