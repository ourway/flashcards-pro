A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor painting in a pastel color palette, depicting a serene coastal scene in Wales. The focal point is a majestic, gentle whale breaching the surface of the turquoise sea. The whale is adorned with subtle daffodil patterns along its back, symbolizing Wales. In the background, rolling green hills dotted with traditional Welsh cottages and grazing sheep stretch towards a soft, pastel-blue sky with fluffy white clouds. A small, ancient stone chapel sits perched on a cliff overlooking the sea. The overall composition evokes a sense of peace, history, and natural beauty, characteristic of Wales. The colors should be soft and calming, dominated by pastel blues, greens, and yellows. The whale, acting as a mnemonic for "Wales," is rendered with detailed anatomical accuracy, avoiding cartoonish features. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a dreamy and memorable scene that subtly reinforces the connection between St. David and Wales. The ratio is 16:9.
