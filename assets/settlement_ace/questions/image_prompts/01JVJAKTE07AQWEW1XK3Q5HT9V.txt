A hand-drawn, realistic, 2D watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape ratio depicting a vibrant scene of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, East London. The colour palette should be pastel-based with hints of red, white and blue, reminiscent of the Union Jack. Centrally positioned is the ArcelorMittal Orbit, painted in pastel red, its unique twisting form dominating the skyline. Around its base, illustrate the lush greenery of the park with pastel green hues, dotted with stylized representations of people enjoying recreational activities: cycling, jogging, and picnicking. In the background, show a suggestion of the modern architecture of the surrounding Stratford area using light grey and white pastel shades, ensuring the Orbit and park remain the focal point. A winding pastel blue river flows gently through the scene, reflecting the sky. Symbolic elements include stylized Olympic rings subtly incorporated into the park's landscaping – perhaps as flowerbeds or pathways – to reinforce the connection to the 2012 Games. The overall composition should evoke a sense of energy, celebration, and the lasting legacy of the Olympics in East London, encouraging recall of Stratford as the main site. No text or numbers should be visible.
