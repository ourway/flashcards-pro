A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The scene depicts a nighttime view of the Houses of Parliament, rendered in shades of grey stone with illuminated windows casting a warm yellow glow. Above the iconic clock tower of Big Ben, a stylized explosion of vibrant red, orange, and yellow fireworks bursts against a deep blue, star-speckled sky, mimicking the colors of the UK flag. Below, near the base of the Houses of Parliament, a shadowy figure, subtly resembling Guy Fawkes with a feathered hat and dark cloak, stands holding a lantern, partially obscured by smoke. Barrels with a dark substance are placed discreetly close to the building. The colour palette should lean towards the UK flag, with a dominant blue for the night sky, touches of red in the fireworks, and white and grey tones for the buildings. The composition should create a sense of dramatic tension, highlighting the contrast between the grandeur of Parliament and the clandestine plot. The overall art style should be reminiscent of historical illustrations, aiming for an educational and slightly somber tone, without being overly graphic or violent.
