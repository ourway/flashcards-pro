A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a whimsical yet informative scene set in a lush, green Irish landscape. The central focus is a stylized battlefield where skeletons, humorously animated and clad in historically inaccurate but visually distinct 17th-century armor (some with orange sashes, others with subtle royal blue accents), are engaged in a lighthearted "battle." Instead of weapons, they are playfully brandishing oversized femur bones and humorous bone-shaped clubs. A wide river meanders through the battlefield. This is "The Boyne" river, which is signposted with a wooden plaque. The atmosphere is bright and airy, utilizing a pastel color palette dominated by blues, greens, and oranges to evoke a sense of historical distance while maintaining accessibility. The sky is a soft, watercolor wash of light blue, with fluffy white clouds suggesting a peaceful day juxtaposed with the skeletal skirmish below. In the background, rolling hills dotted with ancient-looking stone structures fade into the distance, hinting at the long history of the region. The overall composition is balanced, with the skeletal figures concentrated in the center of the frame, ensuring they remain the primary focus. The style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy while retaining a lighthearted and memorable quality, avoiding any graphic or violent depictions.
