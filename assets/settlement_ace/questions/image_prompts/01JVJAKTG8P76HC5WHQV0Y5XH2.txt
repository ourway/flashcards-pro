A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting the interior of the Royal Albert Hall during a performance. The hall is bathed in warm, golden light emanating from the stage, illuminating a full orchestra in formal attire. Instruments like violins, cellos, trumpets, and flutes are clearly visible, each rendered with careful detail. A conductor stands on a podium, his baton raised mid-air, leading the orchestra. The audience fills the tiered seating, their forms suggested by soft, impressionistic brushstrokes in pastel shades of blue, pink, and cream. Above, the intricate details of the Albert Hall's dome are visible, featuring a subtle, repeating pattern reminiscent of musical notes. The overall composition focuses on the harmonious blend of music, architecture, and audience, creating a sense of grandeur and cultural significance. The colour palette leans towards pastel shades, interspersed with richer golds and reds to emphasize the warmth and vibrancy of the concert. A single spotlight shines on the conductor, drawing the eye to the heart of the musical performance. The image should evoke a sense of tradition, elegance, and the BBC's long-standing commitment to promoting classical music through "The Proms."
