A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour painting in a realistic style, showcasing a split scene representing the allocation of National Insurance contributions. The composition is divided vertically down the center. On the left side, depict a serene scene of elderly individuals enjoying their retirement in a lush, green park, subtly reminiscent of the English countryside. One is reading a newspaper, another is playing bowls, and a third is strolling with a walking stick. The scene is bathed in soft, warm pastel colours, primarily blues and greens. Symbolically, a stylized, overflowing piggy bank, coloured in the Union Jack flagâ€™s colours (red, white, and blue), sits subtly in the background, representing the National Insurance fund. On the right side, illustrate a vibrant and bustling hospital scene, showcasing doctors and nurses attending to patients. The hospital is modern and clean, with patients of diverse ages and backgrounds. The colour palette here should also remain in pastel shades, but with a slightly cooler tone, dominated by blues and whites to represent the healthcare aspect. Between the two scenes, and subtly appearing as if being 'poured' from the piggy bank, are faint, flowing lines of light connecting the piggy bank to the retirement park and the hospital, visually demonstrating where the National Insurance funds are directed. The background is a soft, watercolour wash of the UK flag colours, subtly separated into their respective sections. The overall impression is one of calm assurance and responsible financial allocation, while the absence of any educational imagery on either side subtly reinforces that National Insurance is not used for education.
