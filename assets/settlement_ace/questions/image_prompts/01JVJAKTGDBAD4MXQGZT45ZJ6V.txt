A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a set of scales of justice, slightly off-balance, positioned centrally in the 16:9 frame. One side of the scale holds a meticulously rendered, closed law book with a civil emblem (a stylized gavel and laurel wreath) subtly embossed on its cover. The other side of the scale is visibly lighter and empty. The background consists of a soft, blurred depiction of a modern office environment, rendered in pastel blues and grays, suggesting a workplace setting. The scales are predominantly colored in muted gold and silver, reflecting light subtly. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues reminiscent of the UK flag's subtle shades â€“ a muted blue for the background office, a soft red for the ribbon tying the civil law book, and a hint of white in the balance of the scales. The composition emphasizes the imbalance, highlighting that civil matters, symbolized by the book, outweigh the absent criminal aspect. The art style should evoke a sense of seriousness and legal precision, making the image educational and memorable. No text should be present in the image, only visual storytelling.
