A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a serene scene set in a lush, green meadow alongside the River Thames. Dominating the center of the 16:9 landscape is a sturdy, ancient oak tree with gnarled branches reaching towards the sky. Beneath the oak, a regal yet concerned-looking King John, adorned in royal blue and gold robes, reluctantly affixes his seal to a large, parchment scroll – the Magna Carta. Several barons, dressed in deep red and navy blue tunics, stand observing the scene with solemn expressions. The river reflects the pastel hues of the sky – soft blues, pinks, and creams – creating a peaceful yet significant atmosphere. In the background, the faint outline of Windsor Castle can be seen, subtly reminding the viewer of the monarchy's historical seat of power. The overall color palette leans towards the colors of the UK flag, with the green of the meadow symbolizing England, the blue of the king's robes and river representing the skies, and the red of the barons' tunics adding a touch of vibrancy. The composition should evoke a sense of historical importance while remaining approachable and educational, free of any text or numbers, focusing solely on the visual narrative.
