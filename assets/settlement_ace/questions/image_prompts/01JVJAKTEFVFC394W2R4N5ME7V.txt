A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is on a serene, rolling Scottish hillside rendered in pastel greens and blues. A weathered, ancient stone Celtic cross stands prominently in the center, its design intricate and subtly echoing the saltire (St. Andrew's Cross). Behind the cross, the sky is a soft, gradient blend of blues and whites, reminiscent of the Scottish flag's colours. Emerging from behind the cross and subtly arching across the sky is a faint, ethereal representation of an 'X' shape, formed by two intersecting bands of light. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and contemplative, with a gentle breeze suggested by the slight movement of the grass. The art style is realistic, detailed, and evokes a sense of history and spirituality. The colour palette leans towards pastel shades with accents of blue and white to subtly represent the Scottish flag, avoiding overly bright or jarring colours. The composition is balanced, drawing the eye to the central cross and the symbolic 'X' in the sky, creating a visual mnemonic for St. Andrew's Cross and his patronage of Scotland.
