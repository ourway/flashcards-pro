A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the Concorde supersonic jet in flight. The Concorde, predominantly white with subtle blue and red accents reminiscent of both the UK and French flags, dominates the center of the frame. The jet is depicted at a slight upward angle, suggesting its powerful ascent. Beneath the Concorde, the English Channel is visible, rendered in varying shades of blue, subtly hinting at the geographical separation between the UK and France. On the left side of the channel, the white cliffs of Dover are visible, rendered in a soft, realistic style. On the right side, a blurred coastline representing the French coast appears. Above the Concorde, a clear blue sky fades into a soft, pastel sunrise, with the sun positioned slightly off-center to the right, casting a warm, golden glow on the aircraft. The overall color palette should be soft and muted, primarily consisting of blues, whites, reds, and golds, evoking a sense of peace and technological achievement. The art style should be realistic, like a detailed technical drawing, focusing on accurate depiction of the Concorde's form and features. The image should evoke a sense of Anglo-French cooperation and innovation.
