A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a solemn scene inside a traditional British courtroom. The color palette leans heavily on the blues, reds, and whites of the Union Jack, with subtle pastel undertones. The focus is on the jury box, where twelve diverse individuals are seated, their faces showing varying degrees of contemplation and seriousness. Each person is distinct, representing different ages, ethnicities, and backgrounds found within the UK. The jury box itself is made of dark, polished wood, contrasting with the lighter stone walls of the courtroom. In the background, partially blurred to maintain focus on the jury, are the judge's bench and the advocates' tables. A single shaft of sunlight streams in from a high window, illuminating the faces of the jurors, symbolizing the weight of their responsibility. The overall atmosphere is one of gravity, justice, and the collective decision-making process. The style should evoke the feeling of classic British illustrations, aiming for a timeless and educational aesthetic.
