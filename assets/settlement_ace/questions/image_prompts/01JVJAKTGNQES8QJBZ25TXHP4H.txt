A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Welsh National Assembly building situated prominently in Cardiff. The building should be accurately rendered, showcasing its architectural features with precision. The composition should emphasize the building's location within Cardiff, including subtle background elements such as the waterfront or cityscape, rendered in soft, pastel colours. In the foreground, subtly include symbolic representations of Welsh heritage â€“ perhaps a stylized, flowing depiction of the Welsh flag's dragon integrated into the landscape design around the building, ensuring it is an artistic element rather than a literal flag. The sky should be a soft, watercolour wash of blues and whites, suggesting a typical Welsh day. The overall colour palette should lean towards pastel shades, with occasional deeper blues and reds echoing the colours of the Welsh flag, but in a muted, artistic manner. The illustration should evoke a sense of place and history, subtly reinforcing the connection between the National Assembly and its location in Cardiff. The image should be 16:9 ratio with landscape orientation. The main subject and idea should be mainly in the center of the image.
