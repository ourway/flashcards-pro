A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, resembling historical paintings from the 17th century. The colour palette should consist of pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly referencing the UK flag. The central focus is King Charles I, depicted with a worried expression, standing in a grand, yet sparsely furnished hall. He is attempting to hold back a surging wave of Scottish soldiers dressed in traditional kilts and carrying banners with Presbyterian symbols. Behind King Charles I, a partially opened door reveals a group of Parliament members, portrayed as hesitant and unwilling to offer assistance. Empty treasure chests lie scattered around the king, symbolizing his lack of funds. The overall composition should convey a sense of turmoil and desperation, highlighting the king's struggle to control the situation. The background features subtle details of Scottish landscapes blending into English architecture, representing the invasion. The style should emulate classical portraiture but with an added layer of narrative storytelling, capturing the historical tension between the monarchy, the Scottish church, and the English Parliament. The image should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and dramatic irony, emphasizing the key outcomes of King Charles I's actions.
