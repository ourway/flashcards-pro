A serene, watercolor-style landscape of the Scottish Highlands under a soft, pastel-colored sky. In the foreground, centered and taking up most of the frame, stands a fluffy, white sheep with a kind, intelligent expression. The sheep is subtly duplicated, creating a slight echo or ghostly outline around it, hinting at the cloning process. The background features rolling green hills dotted with traditional stone farmhouses and grazing sheep in the distance, all rendered in delicate watercolor washes. A small, almost hidden detail: a tiny, bewildered-looking rabbit is peering out from behind one of the farmhouses, adding a touch of whimsy and subtly referencing the incorrect answer. The overall palette leans towards pastel blues, greens, and creams, reminiscent of a peaceful countryside scene. The art style should evoke a sense of gentleness and scientific wonder, while the composition ensures the sheep is the focal point, reinforcing the association of sheep with the first cloned mammal. The soft rendering should avoid sharp lines or harsh contrasts, maintaining a dreamlike, memorable quality.
