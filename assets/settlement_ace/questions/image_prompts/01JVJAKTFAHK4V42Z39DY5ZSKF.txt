A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D image in a realistic watercolor style, depicting two Tudor roses intertwined, set against a pastel blue background. One rose, a vibrant crimson, represents Anne Boleyn, its petals slightly wilted and a single tear-shaped dewdrop clinging to one. The other rose, a softer pink hue, symbolizing Catherine Howard, is similarly beautiful but also shows subtle signs of distress, with a slightly drooping head. The stems of the roses are entwined with a delicate, tarnished silver chain, subtly suggesting a familial connection and shared fate. The background should fade from a light pastel blue at the top to a slightly darker shade at the bottom, creating a sense of depth. The overall composition should be symmetrical, with the roses positioned centrally, allowing for a balanced and harmonious image. The style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and emotional depth, reminiscent of Tudor-era portraiture, but with a softer, more delicate touch. The pastel color palette is dominant, accented by the crimson and pink of the roses and the tarnished silver of the chain.
