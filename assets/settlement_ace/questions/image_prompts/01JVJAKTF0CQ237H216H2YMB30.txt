A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting Winston Churchill standing resolutely before the Houses of Parliament during the Blitz. The colour palette leans heavily on the red, white, and blue of the Union Jack, with muted, pastel shades adding to the historical atmosphere. Churchill, rendered with careful attention to his iconic features, wears his signature pinstripe suit and holds a partially burnt speech in his hand. The Houses of Parliament in the background are partially shrouded in smoke and fire, suggesting the bombings, but still standing defiantly. Searchlights cut through the night sky, forming intersecting beams. The overall composition should evoke a sense of wartime resilience and leadership. The focus remains firmly on Churchill and the Parliament, symbolising his role as Prime Minister during the Second World War. Subtle details such as sandbags protecting buildings and silhouettes of wartime aircraft in the distance will further enhance the historical context. The artistic style should be reminiscent of classic war posters, providing a visually striking and memorable mnemonic for the question.
