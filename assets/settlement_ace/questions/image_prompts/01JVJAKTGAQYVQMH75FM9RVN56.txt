A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style (not cartoonish or abstract), ratio 16:9. The scene depicts a loyal golden retriever, named "Jake" (implied by a subtle name tag on his collar), faithfully following a regal-looking King Charles Spaniel representing James II. The King Charles Spaniel is adorned with a small, ornate crown, and wears a red velvet cape trimmed with ermine. Jake is looking up at the King Charles Spaniel with an expression of unwavering loyalty and devotion. The setting is a lush, green field reminiscent of the English countryside. Rolling hills fade into a soft, pastel blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. In the foreground, wildflowers in shades of red, white, and blue (mimicking the UK flag) add a touch of vibrancy. A gentle breeze rustles the grass, suggesting movement and life. The overall color palette leans towards soft pastels, punctuated by the rich red of the cape and the golden fur of the retriever. The composition focuses on the two dogs, positioning them slightly off-center to create a sense of forward motion. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The style should emulate classic storybook illustrations, evoking a sense of history and tradition. The entire image should convey a feeling of unwavering loyalty and companionship, visually linking "Jake" (the golden retriever) with "James II" (the King Charles Spaniel), thus forming a visual association with the term "Jacobites".
