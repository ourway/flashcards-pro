A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour illustration depicting the Welsh Assembly building bathed in soft, pastel light. The architectural style should be distinctly Welsh, incorporating slate roofing and natural stone elements, evoking a sense of heritage and stability. Inside the building, visible through large, arched windows, depict figures representing Assembly members engaged in animated discussions. Half of the figures are subtly highlighted with the colors of the Welsh flag (red, white, and green), while the other half are highlighted with the colors of the English flag (red and white). The figures are positioned in such a way that the two groups are interacting and coexisting. On a table in the centre, partially visible, place two stacks of documents, one with a red dragon subtly embossed on the cover (representing Welsh publications) and the other with a Tudor rose (representing publications in English). The overall composition should emphasize balance and harmony, symbolizing the equal status of both languages within the Assembly. The style should be realistic but with a touch of whimsy to make it memorable, suitable for educational purposes. The sky above the Assembly is a soft, gradient of pastel blue and pink, resembling dawn, signifying a new day and continuous communication.
