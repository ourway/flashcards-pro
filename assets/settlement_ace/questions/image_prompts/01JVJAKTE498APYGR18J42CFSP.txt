A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a stylized map of the Asian continent, primarily in pastel greens, yellows, and soft blues, filling the 16:9 frame. The map should highlight India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka (Ceylon) with slightly brighter shades of the same pastel colors, making them subtly stand out. Nine doves, each uniquely patterned but sharing a common pastel color palette inspired by the UK flag (red, white, and blue accents), are depicted taking flight from these highlighted countries. The doves are arranged in a gentle, upward curve towards the center of the composition. Subtle, swirling wind patterns, rendered in light blues and whites, emanate from the countries, giving a sense of movement and liberation. The background consists of a softly textured, parchment-like wash, suggesting historical significance. The overall composition should convey a sense of peace, hope, and the dawn of a new era, emphasizing the theme of independence. The art style should evoke a sense of vintage travel posters, with clean lines and delicate shading. The image should be centered, leaving ample space on either side to maintain the 16:9 aspect ratio.
