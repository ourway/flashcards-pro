A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the Olympic rings subtly integrated into a recognizable London cityscape. The River Thames meanders through the center, reflecting the pastel hues of a dawn sky. Prominent landmarks such as the Houses of Parliament, Tower Bridge, and the London Eye are visible, rendered in a realistic style, but with a slight dreamlike quality due to the watercolor medium. Three distinct stadium structures are carefully positioned within the cityscape, each subtly different in architectural style to represent the different eras in which the UK hosted the Olympic Games. One stadium could evoke the 1908 games, another the 1948 games, and the third the 2012 games. These stadiums are not overly emphasized but are integrated harmoniously into the urban landscape, suggesting a long and significant history. Overlaid upon the scene, but slightly faded as if part of the very paper itself, are the five Olympic rings. The rings are positioned centrally, over the Thames, with the blue, yellow, black, green, and red colors subtly blending into the surrounding watercolor washes. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, pinks, and yellows, reminiscent of a vintage travel poster while maintaining a sense of British heritage and tranquility. The absence of text reinforces the purely visual mnemonic.
