A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a bustling street scene at twilight in London's West End. The colour palette should lean towards pastel hues, subtly incorporating reds, whites, and blues reminiscent of the UK flag. Dominating the centre of the image is a grand theatre facade with a brightly lit marquee showcasing a play. The architectural style is distinctly British, featuring ornate details and classic design elements. From the theatre spills an elegantly dressed crowd, their faces reflecting the joy and excitement of the performance they just witnessed. Street lamps cast a warm, inviting glow, illuminating the wet cobblestone streets, reflecting the vibrant lights of the theatre. In the background, iconic London landmarks like the silhouette of Big Ben and the London Eye are subtly visible, grounding the scene in its geographical location. Include vintage red double-decker buses and black cabs navigating the busy streets, adding to the quintessential London atmosphere. The overall composition should evoke a sense of theatrical magic, cultural richness, and the vibrant energy of London's entertainment district, focusing on light and shadow to create depth and a sense of realism without any text.
