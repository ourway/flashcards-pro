A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a pastel colour palette, depicting a serene British countryside scene under a partly cloudy sky. In the foreground, a gentle river flows, reflecting the sky. On the left bank, a character representing a Baptist is shown mid-stride, carefully pouring water from a watering can onto a small seedling planted in the ground. The Baptist is dressed in simple, pastoral clothing, with a kind, thoughtful expression. On the right bank, a character symbolizing a Methodist is depicted methodically organizing a small vegetable garden, using gardening tools with precision. This character is also dressed in modest, practical attire, exuding a sense of order and purpose. The river that separates them eventually merges into a single, wider stream further in the background, symbolizing their shared Christian roots. The stream flows towards a quaint village church nestled among rolling hills, its spire reaching towards the sky, representing the broader Protestant Christian faith. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, emphasizing the connection between the individual actions of the Baptist and Methodist figures and their shared religious heritage within the UK. The pastel colour palette evokes a sense of tranquility and reverence. The artwork should be on a 16:9 ratio.
