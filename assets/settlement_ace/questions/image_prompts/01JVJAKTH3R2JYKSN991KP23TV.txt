A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image depicting a grand, stylized oak tree, its roots firmly planted in European soil. The tree's trunk is thick and strong, representing the foundational nature of EU law. Ascending the trunk are three distinct pathways. The first pathway leads to a cluster of vibrant red apples, labelled with an invisible word representing "Regulations". The second pathway leads to a collection of blue pears, representing "Directives". The third pathway ascends to a group of white cherries, symbolizing "Decisions." All three fruit clusters are connected to the main branches of the tree, emphasizing their integral nature and interconnectedness. Sunlight filters through the leaves, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The background consists of a soft, pastel-colored landscape, reminiscent of the rolling hills of the English countryside, subtly blending the European context with UK imagery. The overall art style is realistic with a touch of fantasy, aiming to create a memorable and visually appealing mnemonic for the different forms of EU law. The color palette leans towards the UK flag colors (red, white, and blue) but in a softer, pastel tone to avoid harshness.
