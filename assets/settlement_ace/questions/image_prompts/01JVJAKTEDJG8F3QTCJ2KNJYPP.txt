A watercolor painting depicting Stonehenge at dawn, set against a backdrop of rolling green hills characteristic of Wiltshire. The stones should be realistically rendered with textures showing their age and weathering. The composition should emphasize the circular arrangement of the stones, with the central altar stone subtly highlighted by the first rays of sunlight. The sky should be a soft gradient of pastel blues, pinks, and oranges, creating a serene and mystical atmosphere. In the foreground, depict a few wisps of mist clinging to the ground, adding to the sense of ancient mystery. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades, with earthy browns and greens dominating the landscape, punctuated by the soft hues of the sunrise. The style should be realistic watercolor, with visible brushstrokes adding depth and texture. Small details, such as the texture of the grass and the subtle variations in the stone colors, should be included to enhance the realism and visual interest. The image should evoke a sense of history, wonder, and the enduring presence of this iconic British monument. The image should be in a 16:9 landscape format.
