A watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a serene Polish countryside scene disrupted by encroaching shadows. The landscape features rolling green fields dotted with traditional Polish farmhouses with red roofs, and a clear blue sky above. In the foreground, a lone, white stork stands gracefully in a field of vibrant red poppies, symbolizing Poland. The right side of the image is gradually overtaken by dark, ominous shadows shaped like stylized German military vehicles (tanks and planes, but abstract enough to be recognizable as symbols, not exact replicas). These shadows are colored in muted greys and blacks, contrasting sharply with the vibrant colors of the Polish landscape. The light source is from the left, casting long, dramatic shadows from the "invading" vehicles. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues, with the red poppies providing a stark contrast. The composition emphasizes the tranquility of the Polish countryside being threatened by an approaching darkness. The intention is to evoke a sense of impending doom and the loss of peace, directly associating the invasion with the vulnerability of Poland. The style should be reminiscent of classic war posters, but with a softer, more melancholic feel. The image should not contain any text or numbers.
