A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration, 16:9 ratio, depicting Guy Fawkes in a realistic style, set against the backdrop of the Houses of Parliament on a chilly, moonlit November night. Fawkes is not cartoonish, but drawn as a stern, determined figure in his early 30s, wearing a dark brown, slightly worn leather jerkin, a wide-brimmed hat casting a shadow over his upper face, and simple, practical trousers. He is illuminated by the faint glow of a hidden lantern at his feet, casting long, dramatic shadows. The Houses of Parliament should be rendered in accurate architectural detail, with a slightly ominous feel, the stone looking cold and imposing under the moonlight. Dominant colors should be deep blues and grays for the night sky and buildings, with touches of warm yellows and oranges from the lantern light. The scene should evoke a sense of suspense and secrecy. The overall composition should be centered, with Fawkes as the focal point, subtly holding a match near a pile of wooden barrels (gunpowder) in the cellar, but the gunpowder should not be the main focus, rather a hint to his intentions. The style leans towards historical realism with artistic license to create a memorable and slightly romanticized image.
