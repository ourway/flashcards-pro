A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolour image in a realistic style, depicting a somber medieval village scene in England during the Black Death. The image should be in a 16:9 landscape ratio, with the main focus centered. The colour palette should be primarily muted pastel tones, punctuated by stark blacks and greys to emphasize the plague. In the center, a winding, muddy village street is nearly deserted. Several houses with thatched roofs line the street, some showing signs of disrepair and abandonment. A single, hooded figure, presumably a plague doctor, walks slowly down the street, their face obscured by a beak-like mask and their clothing dark and layered. A few scattered, unattended carts lie overturned, their wheels broken. In the foreground, a single, prominent black rat scurries across the street, its eyes gleaming ominously. The sky above is overcast and heavy, casting a pall of gloom over the entire scene. Around the edges of the image, subtly incorporate symbolic elements, such as withered flowers and skeletal trees, to reinforce the theme of death and devastation. The overall composition should evoke a sense of desolation and despair, helping the viewer to visually associate the colour black with the historical event.
