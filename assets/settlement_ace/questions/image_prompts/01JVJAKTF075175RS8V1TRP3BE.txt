A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a quaint Scottish village scene under a slightly overcast sky. The color palette should primarily use pastel shades of blue, white, and touches of red, reminiscent of the UK flag, creating a calming and educational atmosphere. Centrally positioned is a modest, stone-built courthouse, its architecture reflecting traditional Scottish design with a slate roof and small, arched windows. In front of the courthouse, a figure representing a Justice of the Peace is depicted. They are wearing traditional Scottish attire, including a muted tartan waistcoat and a subtle badge of office. They are holding a set of scales, tilted very slightly towards balance, symbolizing fairness. Around the courthouse, the village scene unfolds: a few local shops, a cobbled street, and gentle rolling hills in the background. To emphasize the "minor" aspect of the cases handled, a small, playful scene is subtly included: perhaps a cat playfully chasing a ball of yarn near the courthouse steps, or a couple of children innocently playing a game. This adds a touch of levity and reinforces the idea of less serious offenses. The overall composition should evoke a sense of community, order, and the quiet administration of justice in a local setting. The lighting should be soft and diffused, highlighting the architectural details of the courthouse and the serene beauty of the Scottish landscape.
