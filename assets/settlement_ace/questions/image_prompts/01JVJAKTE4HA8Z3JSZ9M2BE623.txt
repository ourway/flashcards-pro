A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a scene representing the English Civil War factions. The color palette leans heavily on pastel blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag, with muted earth tones for backgrounds. The composition is centered around two distinct groups. On the left, a group of "Roundheads" is depicted, characterized by their simple, practical clothing and close-cropped, bowl-shaped haircuts. They stand around a sturdy, round wooden table, engaged in what appears to be a serious debate, their faces etched with determination. The table has a single candle on top. On the right, a group of "Cavaliers" is shown. They are dressed in elaborate, ornate clothing with feathered hats and long, flowing hair. They hold swords loosely and stand with an air of aristocratic nonchalance, their expressions suggesting loyalty to a King, with a crown subtly placed near them. The background features a split landscape: on the Roundheads' side, a simple, rural scene with modest homes; on the Cavaliers' side, a grand estate with manicured gardens. A faint, swirling mist divides the two sides, symbolizing the conflict, but the overall tone is educational and historical rather than violent or aggressive. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a sense of historical distance.
