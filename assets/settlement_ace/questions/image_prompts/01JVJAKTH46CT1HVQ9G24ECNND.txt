A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image in a realistic style, depicting Andy Murray mid-swing during a tennis match. The backdrop features a stylized, yet recognizable, representation of the Scottish Highlands, subtly incorporating the Saltire (Scottish flag) colors â€“ a pastel blue sky and white, snow-capped mountains in the distance. Murray is wearing tennis attire that subtly incorporates a tartan pattern, maintaining a professional yet distinctly Scottish feel. His posture should exemplify power and precision, capturing the essence of his playing style. The tennis court is a classic clay court, with the net clearly visible. The tennis ball is blurred, indicating motion and speed. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, whites, and greens, with subtle accents of red in the tartan to echo the Union Jack colors without being overt. The composition should be centered on Murray, with the background providing context but not distracting from the main subject. The style should evoke classic sports illustrations, emphasizing realism and detail to create a memorable and informative image. The intention is to create an image that connects Andy Murray, tennis, and Scotland, acting as a visual mnemonic for the correct answer.
