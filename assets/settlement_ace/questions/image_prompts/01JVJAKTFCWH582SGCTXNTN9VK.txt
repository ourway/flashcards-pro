A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the interior of York Minster, bathed in ethereal light. The central focus is a colossal stained-glass window, its intricate designs narrating biblical stories through a mosaic of vibrant colors. Predominant colors should be reminiscent of the UK flag, with deep blues, crimson reds, and pure whites interspersed with gold highlights to capture the light streaming through the glass. The windowâ€™s design incorporates recognizable Christian symbols like doves, crosses, and figures from the Bible, rendered in a classic, realistic style. The surrounding architecture of the Minster should be visible, showcasing the Gothic arches and stone pillars, painted in soft, neutral tones to contrast with the colorful window and enhance the sense of depth and scale. Sunlight should stream through the window, casting colorful patterns on the stone floor and creating a warm, inviting atmosphere. The overall style should evoke a sense of reverence and awe, emphasizing the beauty and historical significance of the stained glass. The image should be devoid of any text or numbers.
