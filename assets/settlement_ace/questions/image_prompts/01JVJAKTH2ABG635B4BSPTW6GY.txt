A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting two heraldic roses in a gentle, symbolic conflict. The central focus is on a vibrant, deep red rose, representing the House of Lancaster, and a pristine white rose, symbolizing the House of York. The roses are not aggressively clashing, but rather intertwined, with petals subtly overlapping to indicate the contention. The background features a soft, blurred tapestry-like pattern reminiscent of medieval English textiles, using pastel shades of blue and cream to evoke a sense of history and the UK's cultural heritage. Thorns on the stems are visible but not overly sharp, adding a touch of realism without being threatening. The roses are depicted in full bloom, symbolizing the peak of their respective powers and influence. Subtle shading and lighting effects are used to create depth and dimension, making the roses appear almost tangible. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, with the roses positioned slightly off-center to create a dynamic visual interest. The color palette primarily consists of reds, whites, and greens, with subtle hints of gold to represent the royal connection of both houses. The style should evoke historical accuracy, with the roses resembling those found in medieval heraldry and illuminated manuscripts. The intention is to create a visually striking and educational image that will help viewers remember the contending parties in the Wars of the Roses through the symbolic representation of the red and white roses.
