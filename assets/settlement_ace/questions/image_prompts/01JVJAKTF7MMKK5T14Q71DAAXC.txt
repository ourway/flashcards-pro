A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the symbolic merging of England, Scotland, and Ireland to represent the Act of Union. The artwork should be in a 16:9 landscape format, with the main subject centered. The composition features three stylized rivers, each originating from a distinct landscape representing the three nations: a rolling green English countryside with thatched-roof cottages, a rugged Scottish Highlands scene with mist-covered mountains and a loch, and an Irish landscape with rolling green hills and ancient stone walls. These rivers converge into a single, wider river flowing towards a grand, stylized depiction of the Houses of Parliament. The water in each river subtly reflects the colours of its respective nation's flag (England: St. George's Cross red, Scotland: St. Andrew's Cross blue, Ireland: St. Patrick's Saltire red). As the rivers merge, the water blends into a unified stream with a pastel blue hue, symbolizing unity and the establishment of the United Kingdom. Above the confluence of the rivers, a symbolic Celtic knot, intricately woven from the three national colours, floats ethereally, representing the interconnectedness and binding nature of the Act of Union. The overall colour palette should lean towards pastel shades, evoking a sense of historical significance and national pride. The sky should be a soft, watercolour wash of pastel blues and pinks, with gentle sunlight illuminating the scene.
