A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a quintessential Halloween scene in a quaint British village. The image, in a 16:9 landscape ratio, centers on a group of children dressed in various Halloween costumes (a witch, a ghost, a vampire, and a superhero) standing on the doorstep of a cozy cottage. The cottage is adorned with subtle Halloween decorations: a carved pumpkin glowing with a warm light on the porch, a string of fairy lights shaped like bats hung across the window, and autumn leaves scattered around the entrance. The children are holding open bags or buckets, anticipating treats. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, with accents of orange (pumpkins), black (costumes), and deep purple (twilight sky). The background features a cobbled street lined with similar cottages, creating a sense of community and tradition. A full moon hangs in the upper-right corner, casting a soft, eerie glow over the scene. The overall mood is cheerful and festive, capturing the essence of 'trick or treat' as a light-hearted and common practice. The style should evoke a classic children's book illustration, emphasizing the charm and innocence of the Halloween tradition.
