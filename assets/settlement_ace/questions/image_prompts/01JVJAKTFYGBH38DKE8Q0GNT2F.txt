A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic travel posters, depicting Edinburgh during the Fringe Festival. The scene is dominated by Edinburgh Castle, perched majestically atop Castle Rock, rendered in shades of grey stone highlighted with subtle ochre and umber to capture its ancient texture. The sky above the castle is a soft, pastel blue, transitioning to a warmer, sunset-tinged hue near the horizon. Below the castle, the Royal Mile teems with festival activity. Street performers, depicted with diverse costumes and instruments, fill the street. A mime artist with a white painted face gestures dramatically; a bagpiper in traditional Scottish dress plays his instrument, his kilt rendered in a vibrant tartan pattern using red, green, and blue colours; a juggler tosses colourful clubs. The colour palette leans towards pastel shades accented by the vibrant reds and blues of the Scottish flag. Banners and flags advertising various Fringe shows are draped across buildings, adding to the festive atmosphere. The architectural details of the historic buildings lining the Royal Mile are carefully rendered, emphasizing their unique character. The lighting suggests late afternoon, with long shadows stretching across the street, adding depth and dimension to the scene. The overall impression should be one of vibrant cultural celebration against the backdrop of Edinburgh's iconic landmark. The image should not contain any text.
