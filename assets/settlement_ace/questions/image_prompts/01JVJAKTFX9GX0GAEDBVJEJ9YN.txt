A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor image, in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a panoramic view of the South African landscape during the Boer War era. The central focus is on a vast, sun-drenched savanna, rendered in warm, earthy tones with pastel colours resembling the British flag. In the foreground, subtle impressionistic strokes suggest a field of golden grass, swaying gently in the breeze. Scattered across the middle ground are hints of rocky outcrops and sparse acacia trees, painted with fine detail to convey the arid climate. Distant, hazy blue mountains fade into the horizon, creating a sense of depth and vastness. Subtly placed within the landscape are visual cues relating to the conflict: a covered wagon train slowly traversing the terrain, rendered in muted browns and greys to blend with the environment; and in the far distance, faint smoke plumes rising from what might be a skirmish site, painted in soft, watercolor washes to avoid any graphic depiction of violence. The overall color palette should lean towards the pastels, with touches of red earth, blue skies, and white clouds to subtly evoke the Union Jack. The art style aims for a realistic yet gentle depiction, with soft edges and diffused lighting to create a serene and educational atmosphere, devoid of any text or numbers, but rich in contextual visual cues.
