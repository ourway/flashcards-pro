A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration, ratio 16:9, depicting the iconic BBC Broadcasting House in London. The building should be centrally positioned, bathed in soft, pastel-colored sunlight. A vintage-style television set, with rabbit ear antennas, is subtly placed in the foreground, displaying a vibrant, engaging nature documentary featuring British wildlife (such as deer or birds) within its screen. The screen is entirely free of any advertising, logos, or commercial interruptions. Instead, the focus is solely on the uninterrupted flow of the program. Emanating from the top of the BBC building are thin, ethereal streams of pastel-colored light, symbolizing the broadcasting signal. The overall color palette leans towards the pastel shades of blue, red, and white, subtly referencing the UK flag. The sky is a gradient of soft blues and pinks, creating a calming and educational atmosphere. The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish elements, but infused with the charm of a classic watercolor painting. The absence of any commercial elements on the TV screen should be the most prominent visual cue, reinforcing the idea of the BBC's funding model.
