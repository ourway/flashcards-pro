A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting three distinct doors, side-by-side, set against a backdrop evoking the Scottish Highlands. The doors are the focal point, each representing a possible verdict in a legal trial. The door on the left, colored a somber grey-blue, is slightly ajar, with a shadowy figure hesitantly stepping through, symbolizing "Not Guilty." The central door, painted a stark red, is firmly closed and bolted, representing "Guilty," with faint cracks suggesting the weight of the decision. The door on the right, uniquely colored a muted lavender, stands slightly ajar, with a question mark subtly etched into the wood grain near the handle, symbolizing "Not Proven." Above the doors, a stylized thistle, a national emblem of Scotland, is delicately rendered, its purple blooms adding a touch of Scottish identity. The overall scene is bathed in a soft, diffused light, creating a thoughtful and contemplative atmosphere. The backdrop features a simplified representation of rolling hills and a loch, rendered in pastel shades of green and blue. The horizon is kept low to emphasize the doors and their significance. The style should be realistic but with a slight artistic flourish, emphasizing the emotional weight of each verdict.
