A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a large, vintage-looking electoral register book transformed into a roulette wheel. The book's pages are fanned out to form the wheel's surface, each page clearly showing handwritten names and addresses in neat columns. The color palette leans heavily on pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly evoking the UK flag. A silver ball is depicted mid-spin on the roulette wheel, creating a sense of dynamic movement. Surrounding the wheel, soft, diffused light creates a dreamy, ethereal atmosphere. The background is a muted, textured parchment color, providing contrast and focus on the central roulette wheel. The overall composition is centered, with the roulette wheel occupying the majority of the frame, emphasizing the concept of random selection. The image conveys a sense of historical significance and impartiality, aligning with the British judicial system's values.
