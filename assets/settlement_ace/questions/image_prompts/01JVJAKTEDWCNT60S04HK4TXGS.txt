A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting three distinct scenes representing the Olympic Games hosted in the UK. The artwork uses a pastel color palette with subtle hints of the UK flag's colors (red, white, and blue) integrated tastefully. The scene is set across a 16:9 landscape canvas. The first scene, positioned on the left of the canvas, showcases the 1908 London Olympics, with a focus on the stadium and athletes competing in classic events. The second scene, in the center, illustrates the 1948 London Olympics, emphasizing the post-war atmosphere with symbols of resilience and hope, such as doves taking flight. The third scene, on the right, depicts the 2012 London Olympics, highlighting the modern architecture of the Olympic Park, the vibrant opening ceremony, and diverse athletes from around the world. Each scene has unique architecture of the time period. The composition should create a visual flow, subtly connecting the three scenes, and emphasizing the passage of time and evolution of the Olympic Games within the UK. The overall tone is celebratory, educational, and historically rich, avoiding any text or numbers within the image. The scenes should be easily distinguishable, yet harmonious, representing the unity and sporting spirit of the Olympic Games in the UK.
