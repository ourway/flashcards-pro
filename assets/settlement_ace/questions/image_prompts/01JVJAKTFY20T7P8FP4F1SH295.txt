A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting two distinct scenes subtly merged in the center. The color palette leans towards soft pastel hues, reminiscent of a vintage postcard. On the left side, a weeping bride dressed in a traditional white gown stands in a light rain, holding a wilted bouquet of roses. Her wedding ring is subtly slipping off her finger. The background shows a blurred, gothic-style church with muted grey stones. The right side displays two hands shaking firmly over a torn contract. The contract lies on a mahogany desk scattered with quill pens and inkwells. The desk is partially visible. The backdrop here is a stately library filled with leather-bound books. The light source is soft and diffused, creating a melancholic and reflective mood. The central merging point of the two scenes is a stylized, cracked heart, symbolizing the emotional and legal aspects of divorce and contract breaches. The style should evoke a sense of classic British legal history and domestic life, drawing on the visual language of historical illustrations and courtroom sketches. The overall composition should guide the eye towards the cracked heart at the center, emphasizing the link between the two types of cases heard in County Courts.
