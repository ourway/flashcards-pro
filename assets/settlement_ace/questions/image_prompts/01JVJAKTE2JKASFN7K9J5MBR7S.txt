A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour painting in a landscape orientation (16:9) depicting a stylized timeline of the Hundred Years War. The timeline, rendered as a winding, slightly overgrown stone path, dominates the central visual space. The path begins in England, symbolized by a white rose bush blooming at the starting point, and ends in France, represented by a single, wilted blue iris at the endpoint. The path is not straight; it has several curves and bends, and at certain points, the stone is broken or overgrown with weeds, signifying the pauses and disruptions in the war. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag but softer. At intervals along the path, small, symbolic vignettes are painted: a king with a long beard sitting on a throne, a knight in armor standing with a sword, and a group of peasants working in a field. The sky above is a gradient of pale blue to light grey, suggesting the passage of time. The style should be reminiscent of historical illustrations found in illuminated manuscripts, with a focus on detail and accuracy in the depiction of clothing, armour, and architecture. The image should evoke a sense of length and complexity, hinting at the war's true duration exceeding one hundred years, thereby creating a strong visual mnemonic for the correct answer.
