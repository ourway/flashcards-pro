A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting three distinct vignettes arranged horizontally across a 16:9 canvas. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues, subtly incorporating elements of the UK flag's red, white, and blue. The central focus is on clarity and visual memorability.

The first vignette, positioned on the left, showcases a bustling marketplace scene. A street artist is sketching portraits in the square, a baker sells pastries from a stall, and a carpenter displays handcrafted furniture. Each figure is actively engaged in their craft, emphasizing self-employment, and coins and bills are subtly depicted changing hands. The overall impression is one of vibrant commerce and entrepreneurial spirit.

The second vignette, situated in the center, features a charming row of terraced houses with meticulously maintained gardens. Sunlight streams onto the properties, highlighting the architectural details. A subtle "For Rent" sign is placed in front of one of the houses, signifying income from property. The houses are painted in light pastel colours.

The third vignette, on the right, displays a stylized tree, its branches laden with coins and dividend checks instead of fruit. A small, traditional-style piggy bank sits at the base of the tree, overflowing with savings bonds and deposit slips. The tree's trunk is strong and healthy, symbolizing the growth of investments. Light reflects off the coins and checks, creating a sense of wealth and prosperity. The background is a soft, blurred landscape, providing depth and context. The overall composition should guide the eye smoothly from left to right, emphasizing the three sources of income: self-employment, property, and investments.
