A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting William the Conqueror overseeing the initial construction of the Tower of London. The color palette leans heavily into a pastel scheme with blues, reds, and creams, subtly mirroring the colors of the UK flag. William, depicted as a strong, determined leader with historically accurate Norman attire, stands on a small rise overlooking the construction site. He gestures authoritatively towards the partially completed stone tower. The tower itself is shown in its early stages, constructed from rough-hewn, light-colored stone, under a cloudy sky. Around the tower, various Norman craftsmen are hard at work: some are hauling stones with ropes and pulleys, others are chiseling blocks, and some are mixing mortar. A small Norman flag, bearing a simple heraldic design, flutters atop a partially erected scaffold. In the background, a stylized representation of the Thames River winds its way towards the horizon. The composition is centered, with the tower and William as the focal point, emphasizing the connection between the leader and his imposing structure. The overall mood is one of determination and the establishment of power.
