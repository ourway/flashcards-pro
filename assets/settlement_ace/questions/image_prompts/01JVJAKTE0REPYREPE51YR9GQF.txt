A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a sprawling medieval battlefield under a clouded sky. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, interspersed with strategic pops of red, white, and blue, subtly mirroring the UK flag. In the foreground, two opposing armies clash, their banners displaying heraldic symbols of England (three gold lions) and France (fleur-de-lis). The battle scene is frozen in a moment of intense action, with knights in full armor engaged in combat, archers firing arrows, and foot soldiers locked in close quarters. The ground is churned up and muddy, littered with fallen weapons and armor. Rising above the battlefield, a translucent, spectral clock tower looms, its hands indicating the passing of time. Wrapped around the clock tower, but not obscuring the clock face, is a banner that appears to be aging and disintegrating, representing the passage of time and the war's extended duration. The banner is inscribed with faint Roman numerals that vaguely suggest a number greater than one hundred. The overall composition should evoke a sense of historical grandeur and the prolonged, grueling nature of the conflict, with the clock tower serving as a central visual anchor emphasizing the "116 years" duration, despite being named the "Hundred Years War".
