A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip standing on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. The image should be in a 16:9 landscape format. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades with hints of red, white, and blue, subtly referencing the UK flag. The Queen should be wearing a pastel yellow dress and a hat adorned with delicate white flowers, while Prince Philip is in a navy blue suit with various medals pinned to his chest. They are both smiling and waving to an unseen crowd. The balcony should be intricately detailed with ornate carvings and gilded railings. In the background, subtly suggest the iconic London skyline, using soft watercolor washes to create a sense of depth and perspective, featuring the faint silhouettes of landmarks such as the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye. The overall composition should convey a sense of timelessness, stability, and enduring partnership. Focus on capturing the warmth and familiarity of the royal couple, emphasizing their long-standing relationship through their body language and expressions. The sky should be a soft, pastel blue with fluffy white clouds, adding to the serene and idyllic atmosphere.
