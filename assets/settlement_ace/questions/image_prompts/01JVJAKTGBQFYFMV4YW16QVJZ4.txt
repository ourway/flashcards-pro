A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style (16:9 ratio). The scene depicts a grand, slightly weathered, stone archway reminiscent of a historical entrance to London. Instead of a royal crest or coat of arms above the arch, there's a symbolic arrangement: a broken royal scepter lying horizontally across a simple, yet sturdy, open book. The book's pages are blank, symbolizing a new chapter and the absence of a monarchical text or decree. To the left of the archway, Oliver Cromwell is depicted in muted, earthly tones, dressed in dark, practical clothing, holding a scroll representing the Instrument of Government. He stands not as a king, but as a leader with a thoughtful, almost burdened expression. He is slightly turned towards the archway, his gaze directed towards the book and broken scepter. To the right of the archway, a commoner, dressed in simple, beige clothing, is looking towards Cromwell with a hopeful expression. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, grays, and browns, with subtle hints of red in Cromwell's sash, echoing the UK flag without explicitly recreating it. The sky above the arch is a soft, cloudy blue, suggesting a time of change and uncertainty. The composition focuses on the archway as the central element, emphasizing the shift away from monarchy, with Cromwell and the commoner positioned as key figures in this new era. The style is realistic, avoiding caricature, with attention paid to the textures of the stone, clothing, and paper.
