A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a Scottish courtroom scene. The composition is centered on a jury box, showcasing fifteen diverse individuals representing a cross-section of Scottish society. Each juror is rendered with distinct facial features, clothing, and expressions, avoiding cartoonish or abstract representations. The colour palette leans towards pastel shades, interspersed with subtle hints of the UK flag's colours â€“ a muted red in a scarf, a touch of blue in a jacket, and white in a blouse. The background features a suggestion of the courtroom's architecture, with subtle details like wood panelling and soft light filtering through a window. A single quill pen rests on the jury box's ledge, subtly hinting at the legal proceedings. The overall atmosphere should evoke a sense of solemnity and civic duty, emphasizing the importance of the jury's role in the Scottish legal system. The scene is framed within a 16:9 aspect ratio, ensuring the main subject remains centrally positioned. The image should not contain any text or numbers, focusing solely on the visual representation of fifteen jurors.
