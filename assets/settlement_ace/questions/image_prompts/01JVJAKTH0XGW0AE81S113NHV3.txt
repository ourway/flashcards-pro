A hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a classic watercolor painting. The scene centers on a stylized, ornate royal crown, rendered with meticulous detail. The crown, primarily in shades of silver and gold, is adorned with various precious gemstones, with a particularly large, central diamond taking prominence. The diamond sparkles brilliantly, emitting rays of light in pastel shades of pink, blue, and yellow. The background features a soft, blurred depiction of the British countryside, including rolling green hills and a hint of a stately home in the distance. The overall color palette leans towards pastel tones, interspersed with the rich, saturated colors of the gemstones. Positioned slightly behind and to either side of the crown are two banners draped elegantly. One banner features a stylized Tudor rose. The other banner has the Scottish thistle. The composition is symmetrical, with the crown acting as the central focal point, drawing the viewer's eye. The art style should evoke a sense of history, tradition, and regal elegance, suitable for educational purposes. The scene should feel celebratory and dignified, reflecting the significance of a royal jubilee.
