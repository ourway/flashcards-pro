A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting two distinct, yet interconnected, landscapes under a softly clouded sky. On the left side, representing Northern Ireland, a rolling green landscape features a quaint village with a traditional stone church nestled among the homes. The church is subtly separated from the village by a winding, shallow stream. A single, fallen stone lies in the stream, representing a slight distancing. The sky above this landscape is a soft, pastel blue. On the right side, symbolizing Wales, a mountainous terrain dominates, with sheep grazing on the hillsides. A Celtic cross stands prominently on a hilltop, overlooking a small, dispersed community. A barely visible, thin line of mist separates the cross from the community, signifying a nuanced independence. The sky above Wales is a gentle, pastel green. A delicate, barely-there bridge made of intertwined vines connect the two landscapes at the horizon line, symbolizing a shared history and unity, but the bridge is not heavily fortified, again representing independence. The overall color palette should utilize pastel shades of blue, green, and white, reminiscent of the UK flag's colors, creating a serene and educational atmosphere. The art style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, ensuring the image is easily understood and memorable. Focus on details like the texture of the stone, the wool of the sheep, and the intricate carvings on the Celtic cross to enhance visual engagement.
