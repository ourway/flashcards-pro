A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a symbolic representation of the Union Jack, not as a flag itself, but as an abstract composition of its constituent parts. Imagine the canvas divided into four quadrants, subtly delineated by faint, intersecting lines. The upper-left quadrant features a stylized English rose, rendered in soft whites and reds, with delicate green leaves. The upper-right quadrant displays a Scottish thistle, colored in gentle purples and greens, its spiky details carefully depicted. The lower-left quadrant presents a Welsh daffodil, painted in sunny yellows and vibrant greens, its trumpet-shaped bloom facing outwards. Finally, the lower-right quadrant showcases a Northern Irish shamrock, its three leaves rendered in varying shades of emerald green. These floral emblems, representing England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland respectively, are gently overlapping in the very center of the image. The background is a very light pastel blue. The overall colour palette leans towards the red, white, and blue of the Union Jack, but softened into pastel shades to create a calm, educational atmosphere. The style is reminiscent of vintage botanical illustrations, emphasizing detail and accuracy. The composition is balanced and harmonious, symbolizing the unity of the four nations.
