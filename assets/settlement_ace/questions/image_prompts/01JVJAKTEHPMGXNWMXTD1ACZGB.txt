A hand-drawn, realistically styled, 2D image in a watercolor art style, depicting Margaret Thatcher standing confidently in front of the iconic black door of 10 Downing Street. Thatcher is portrayed as a strong, composed figure, wearing a classic blue suit reminiscent of the Conservative party color, and a string of pearls. The colors should subtly evoke the Union Jack, with the blue of her suit, a hint of red in the brickwork of Downing Street, and the white of her pearls. The sky above is a soft, pastel blue with fluffy white clouds. The architecture of Downing Street should be meticulously detailed, emphasizing its historical significance. In the foreground, a small, symbolic iron gate is partially open, suggesting a barrier being crossed. Around the gate, there are small, blooming bluebells, symbolizing humility and constancy. The overall composition should focus on Thatcher as a pioneering figure, breaking through traditional barriers. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a sense of historical importance and respect. The main subject and idea should be mainly in the center of the image (16:9 ratio bounderies).
