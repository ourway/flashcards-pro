A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic style reminiscent of 18th-century academic illustrations, with a pastel colour palette dominated by soft blues, reds, and whites. The central focus is a portrait of Adam Smith, depicted as a thoughtful gentleman in Enlightenment-era attire: a powdered wig, cravat, and coat. He is seated at a wooden writing desk, bathed in soft, natural light emanating from a window to the left. On the desk, arranged neatly, are stacks of gold and silver coins, subtly hinting at the concept of wealth and trade. Scattered around the coins are quill pens, inkwells, and partially written manuscripts filled with equations and charts that symbolize economic principles. Behind Smith, the background subtly fades into a grand library setting, with shelves filled with leather-bound books, globes, and busts of classical philosophers, representing the intellectual atmosphere of the Enlightenment. The overall composition should evoke a sense of scholarly pursuit and the birth of economic thought, creating a memorable visual association between Adam Smith and the field of economics. The image should be 16:9 and landscape orientation.
