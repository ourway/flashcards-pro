A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Houses of Parliament bathed in the soft glow of a pastel sunrise. The architectural details of the building are accurately rendered, showcasing its iconic clock tower and intricate stonework. Dominating the foreground is a stylized, centrally-placed, three-branched tree. Each branch represents a source of life peer nomination. The central and thickest branch, positioned directly in the middle, is adorned with a miniature door resembling the entrance to 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's residence. This branch is slightly taller and more robust than the others. Flanking it on either side are two branches, each representing the leaders of the main political parties. These branches are similar in size and bear miniature rosettes, one in a pastel blue (representing the Conservative party) and the other in a pastel red (representing the Labour party). Each branch is depicted with delicate, light green leaves symbolizing growth and influence. The entire tree is rooted in a bed of lush green grass, subtly suggesting the foundation of British society and its institutions. The colour scheme should lean towards pastel shades of blue, red, and green, subtly echoing the colours of the UK flag while maintaining a gentle, educational aesthetic. The sky should be a blend of soft blues, pinks, and yellows, conveying a sense of dawn and new beginnings, symbolizing the ongoing process of nominations.
