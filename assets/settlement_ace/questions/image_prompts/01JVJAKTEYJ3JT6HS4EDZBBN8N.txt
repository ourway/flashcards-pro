A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the interior of the UK Parliament's House of Commons. The scene is bathed in soft, natural light filtering through the large, arched windows, highlighting the rich wood paneling and the iconic green benches. In the center of the image, one particular green bench seat is visibly empty and draped with a black cloth, subtly symbolizing the passing of an MP. To the side, a quill pen rests on a parchment scroll atop a desk, suggesting a resignation letter. The color palette leans towards muted, pastel shades of blue, red, and beige, reminiscent of the UK flag but with a softer, more contemplative feel. The composition is carefully balanced to draw the eye to the empty seat and the resignation scroll, using leading lines from the surrounding benches and architectural details. The overall atmosphere should be one of respectful solemnity and the quiet anticipation of change. The image should evoke a sense of British history and parliamentary procedure, without including any text or numbers, and should be suitable for educational purposes. The ratio is 16:9
