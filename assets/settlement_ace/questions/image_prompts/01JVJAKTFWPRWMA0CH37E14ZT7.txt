A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is on the interior of a traditional-looking British pub, subtly stylized for clarity. Predominantly using a pastel color palette with hints of red, white, and blue to evoke the UK flag. The composition should emphasize depth and perspective. In the foreground, a uniformed British police officer ('bobby') with a stern but not aggressive expression, wearing the classic custodian helmet, is gesturing with his right hand, palm facing outwards, as if indicating "stop" or "no." His left hand holds a traditional-looking notepad and pencil. Behind him, slightly blurred, are pub patrons sitting at tables, raising glasses of ale. A wispy trail of smoke is subtly emanating from an extinguished cigarette in an ashtray on one of the tables, but the overall atmosphere is clean and well-lit. A "No Smoking" sign is discreetly placed on the wall, designed in a classic, understated style. The image should convey a sense of polite authority and the clear prohibition of smoking in enclosed public spaces. The art style should be reminiscent of classic British illustrations, aiming for a timeless and educational feel.
