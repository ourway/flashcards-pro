A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic, watercolor style, depicting a young King Edward VI seated at an ornate, dark wood desk. He is dressed in regal attire, including a crimson velvet robe trimmed with ermine and a golden crown resting lightly on his head. His expression is thoughtful and determined. Before him lies an open, bound book; its pages filled with elegant calligraphy. Sunlight streams in from a stained-glass window depicting the Tudor rose, casting hues of red, white, and green across the scene. The desk is adorned with objects representing education and faith: a quill pen resting in an inkwell, a stack of parchment, and a small, intricately carved wooden cross. The background features a subtly rendered interior of a royal study, with bookshelves lined with leather-bound volumes. The color palette should primarily consist of muted reds, blues, and golds, reminiscent of the UK flag, with accents of pastel green and cream to create a soft, educational atmosphere. The overall composition should be balanced and symmetrical, drawing the viewer's eye to the central figure of Edward VI and the book, symbolizing his role in commanding the writing of the Book of Common Prayer. The image should evoke a sense of history, scholarship, and the importance of religious texts in British culture.
