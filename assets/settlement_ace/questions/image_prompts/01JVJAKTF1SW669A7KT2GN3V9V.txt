A hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a scene in a grand, ornate room reminiscent of 17th-century England. The color palette leans towards pastel shades with accents of red, white, and blue subtly woven in. The central focus is a large, intricately carved wooden table. Instead of swords and weapons typically associated with revolutions, the table is covered with quills, inkwells, and stacks of parchment. Several figures, dressed in the attire of the time – long coats, breeches, and wigs – are seated around the table, engaged in animated but peaceful discussion. One figure is gesturing emphatically with a quill in hand. Sunlight streams through a tall, arched window in the background, illuminating the scene with a soft, golden glow. The room is filled with symbolic details: a dove perched on a window ledge (peace), a laurel wreath hanging above the table (victory without bloodshed), and a discarded sword lying on the floor in the far corner, untouched and unused. The overall impression is one of order, civility, and a profound shift occurring through dialogue and diplomacy, not violence. The artwork aims to capture the essence of a "glorious" and bloodless revolution.
