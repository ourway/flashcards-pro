A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image, ratio 16:9, depicting the Houses of Parliament at Westminster, focusing on the Victoria Tower and the surrounding architectural details. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the Union Jack's colors. The scene should be bathed in a soft, diffused sunlight, creating a gentle, inviting atmosphere. In the foreground, visualize a flowing river Thames, its surface reflecting the sky. Emerging from the river, translucent and ethereal figures representing historical Lords and Baronesses gradually morph into more modern, diverse representations. These figures should be depicted in a way that suggests evolution and change, with subtle visual cues indicating a shift in demographics and societal roles over time. The overall composition should convey a sense of historical continuity blended with contemporary adaptation. Style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish exaggerations, with a focus on accurate architectural representation and detailed rendering of the figures. There should be no text present in the image. The subtle changes in the figures' attire, expressions, and overall representation should symbolize the evolving role and membership of the House of Lords over the past 50 years, visually representing the truth of the statement.
