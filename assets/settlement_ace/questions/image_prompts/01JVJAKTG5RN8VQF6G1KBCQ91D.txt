A vividly colored, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical tapestry. The scene is set within a grand, yet somber, Tudor-era cathedral, bathed in soft light filtering through stained-glass windows. In the center, Queen Mary I, depicted with a stern expression and wearing a crimson gown and royal crown, is seated on a throne. At her feet, several figures dressed in simple, muted attire, representing Protestants, are kneeling with bowed heads, their faces reflecting sorrow and fear. A symbolic fire burns subtly in the foreground, casting long shadows and hinting at persecution. The color palette should lean towards deep reds, golds, and muted greys, with subtle accents of blue and white reminiscent of the UK flag, to evoke a sense of historical drama and solemnity. The composition should emphasize the Queen's power and the vulnerability of the kneeling figures, creating a clear visual narrative of religious persecution. The background includes architectural details of the cathedral, such as arches and pillars, adding depth and context to the scene. The overall art style should be similar to a Renaissance painting, with careful attention to detail and realism.
