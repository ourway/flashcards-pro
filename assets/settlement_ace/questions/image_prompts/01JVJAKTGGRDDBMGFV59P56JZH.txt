A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration depicting a rolling Irish landscape under a pastel-colored sky, adhering to a 16:9 aspect ratio. The scene is divided into two distinct sections. On the left side, visualize an old, weathered stone cottage with a thatched roof, characteristic of traditional Irish architecture. In front of the cottage, depict a group of figures dressed in the attire of 17th-century Catholic landowners, their faces etched with expressions of sorrow and displacement. Their clothes should be dark, earthy tones. On the right side of the image, separated by a winding dirt path, illustrate a more modern (for the 17th century) farmhouse with sturdier construction, possibly brick or stone, and a well-tended field. Figures dressed as 17th-century Protestant farmers, their clothing in brighter, more practical colors, are actively working the land – plowing fields, tending livestock, and overseeing the harvest. The overall color palette should lean towards the pastel shades of the UK flag – soft blues, reds, and whites – to create a calming yet symbolic representation. The composition is crucial: the path visually connects and separates the two groups, symbolizing the shift in land ownership. The focus should be on the contrast between the two groups and their respective homes and activities, highlighting the replacement of Catholic landowners by Protestant farmers. The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, to accurately represent the historical context.
