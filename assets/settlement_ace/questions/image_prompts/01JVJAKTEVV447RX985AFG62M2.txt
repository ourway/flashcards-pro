A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, rendered in a pastel colour palette with subtle hints of red, white, and blue, depicting a diverse group of twelve individuals seated in a jury box. The jury box is constructed from light-coloured wood and is positioned within a courtroom setting, though the judge and other courtroom elements are intentionally blurred in the background to maintain focus on the jury. The jurors represent a cross-section of British society: young and old, various ethnicities, men and women, each dressed in everyday attire—sweaters, jackets, simple shirts—avoiding any formal or professional clothing. Each face should show a thoughtful and serious expression, suggesting the weight of their civic duty. To emphasize the "random" selection aspect, each juror has a unique feature or accessory: one wears glasses, another has a visible tattoo, another holds a pen, another has a hearing aid, another has a headscarf. The light should be soft and diffused, illuminating each juror's face evenly to highlight their individuality while still conveying their collective unity as a jury. The composition should be centered on the jury box, with the background elements providing context without distraction. The overall impression should be one of ordinary people undertaking an important civic responsibility, emphasizing the random selection from the electoral register.
