A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image in a realistic style, depicting a grand, antique set of scales, perfectly balanced. The scales are crafted from polished wood and brass, evoking a sense of historical significance. On one side of the scale, arrange a diverse group of miniature figures, each representing a different segment of the population in Scotland and Wales. These figures are dressed in varied traditional and modern attire, subtly hinting at the cultural diversity of the regions. They are not identical but represent a range of ethnicities and backgrounds. On the other side of the scale, neatly stacked miniature chairs, each representing a seat in the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, are placed. The number of chairs corresponds proportionally to the visual "weight" or number of figures on the opposite side. The background features a soft, blurred landscape of rolling hills and valleys, characteristic of both Scotland and Wales. The colour palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, white, and soft red, echoing the colours of the UK flag but in a gentle, muted tone. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a balanced and harmonious composition. The overall impression should be one of fairness, balance, and proportional representation, visually connecting the diverse population to their representation in government.
