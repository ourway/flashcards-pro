A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical tapestries, depicting King Henry VIII standing in a grand hall. The hall is adorned with Tudor roses and Welsh dragons intertwined in the architectural details. Henry VIII is portrayed in his iconic attire: a rich, crimson velvet robe trimmed with ermine, a jeweled collar, and a Tudor bonnet. He holds a document, seemingly a formal decree, sealed with the royal coat of arms, which prominently features both the English lion and the Welsh dragon united. Behind him, subtle symbolic representations of England and Wales are visible; on one side, a verdant English countryside scene, and on the other, the rugged mountains of Wales. The colour palette is dominated by regal reds, golds, and deep blues, with accents of earthy greens and browns to reflect the landscapes. The overall composition is symmetrical, emphasizing the union. A soft, diffused light illuminates the scene, giving it a sense of historical gravitas. The image should evoke a feeling of solemnity and the weight of historical events. The illustration should be suitable for educational purposes, avoiding caricature or any disrespectful depiction of historical figures.
