A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting Rudyard Kipling sitting at his writing desk in his study. The room is filled with colonial-era artifacts: a globe, maps of India and the UK, and stacks of books. Kipling, dressed in a tweed suit, is illuminated by the warm glow of a desk lamp. His face is thoughtful as he gazes at a partially written manuscript. The composition should center on Kipling and his desk, creating a sense of focused intellect and historical context. Behind him, subtly visible through a window, is a tranquil, idealized scene of a British colonial administrator helping local Indian villagers with farming, symbolizing the "positive influence" often portrayed in his works. The colour palette should primarily consist of warm, muted earth tones (browns, greens, and creams), evoking the era, with subtle hints of red and blue in the rug and book bindings, referencing the UK flag. The overall mood should be one of quiet contemplation and the perceived benefits of the British Empire.
