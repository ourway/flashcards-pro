A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour painting in a realistic style depicting a serene Scottish landscape at twilight. Rolling, heather-covered hills dominate the background, fading into a soft, pastel-coloured sky of blues, purples, and hints of pink reminiscent of the Scottish flag. A gentle river meanders through the valley, reflecting the fading light. In the foreground, a weathered stone bridge arches gracefully over the river. On the bridge, a lone figure stands silhouetted against the twilight sky: a man with a thoughtful expression, holding a quill and a scroll of parchment. The scroll is subtly adorned with a thistle motif, the national flower of Scotland. He is dressed in traditional Scottish attire, including a kilt in a muted tartan pattern. Around him, fireflies dance in the air, their soft glow illuminating the scene with a touch of magic. The overall composition evokes a sense of peace, nostalgia, and artistic inspiration, connecting the viewer to the romanticism of Scottish poetry and the legacy of Robert Burns, the Bard. The colour palette should consist of soft, pastel shades and colours resembling the Scottish flag (blue and white), creating a harmonious and memorable image.
