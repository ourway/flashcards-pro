A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, set against a backdrop reminiscent of a classic British courtroom. The central focus is a set of antique scales of justice, perfectly balanced, with a miniature crown resting on one side, symbolizing the Crown Court, and a sheriff's badge subtly placed on the other, representing the Sheriff Courts. The scales are bathed in soft, diffused light, casting gentle shadows that highlight the intricate details of the courtroom setting. Subtly, but significantly, the objects on each side of the scale are not feathers or light objects, but rather symbolic representations of serious crimes: a jeweled dagger, suggesting violent offenses, and a miniature model of a bank vault, alluding to financial crimes. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with hints of royal blue, crimson, and gold, echoing the colors of the UK flag in a muted, sophisticated manner. The composition is carefully arranged to draw the viewer's eye to the scales, emphasizing the gravity and balance of justice. The background includes elements like leather-bound law books and a gavel, further reinforcing the courtroom setting and the seriousness of the subject matter. The illustration avoids any cartoonish or abstract elements, opting instead for a realistic depiction that conveys the solemnity and importance of the judicial system.
