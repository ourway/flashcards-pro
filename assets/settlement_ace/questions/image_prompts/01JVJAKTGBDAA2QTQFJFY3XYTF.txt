A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting two distinguished gentlemen seated at a robust oak table in a sunlit study. The scene evokes the ambiance of 18th-century Scotland. On the left, a man with a thoughtful expression, his quill pen poised above a stack of papers representing economic theories, embodies Adam Smith. He's dressed in a tweed suit, reflecting his intellectual pursuits. To the right, a man with a serene face, reminiscent of classical philosophers, is deep in contemplation, symbolizing David Hume. He is clad in a velvet coat, hinting at his philosophical contributions. A globe sits between them, subtly emphasizing the global impact of their ideas. The background features bookshelves filled with antique books bound in leather, and a window overlooks a rolling, green Scottish landscape. The color palette leans towards pastel shades with hints of red, white, and blue, mirroring the UK flag. The overall composition is centered, with the two figures forming the focal point, ensuring a balanced and educational visual representation of the Enlightenment era's prominent intellects.
