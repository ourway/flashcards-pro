A hand-drawn, realistic, 2D watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is on a vast, golden wheat field representing Poland. The field occupies the lower two-thirds of the frame, gently swaying in a light breeze. Above the field, the sky transitions from a bright, hopeful blue on the right side of the frame to a dark, ominous grey on the left. A long, dark shadow in the shape of an iron cross (a German military symbol), stretches from the grey sky, gradually encroaching upon the golden wheat field. The shadow doesn't fully cover the field but casts a clear, encroaching darkness. In the far distance, silhouetted against the horizon, are faint outlines of traditional Polish farmhouses and windmills. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with the golden wheat providing a warm contrast to the cool blues and greys of the sky. The style should evoke a sense of historical drama and impending doom, whilst remaining aesthetically pleasing and educational.
