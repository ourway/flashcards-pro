A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a regal scene set against a backdrop of the British Isles. The artwork is in a 16:9 landscape ratio and uses a pastel color palette, dominated by soft blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the Union Jack. The central focus is a majestic sailing ship, adorned with the royal standard of James VI of Scotland (later James I of England), gracefully navigating the Irish Sea. James VI himself stands prominently on the ship's deck, rendered with careful attention to historical accuracy in his attire. To the east, the shores of England and Wales are visible, represented by rolling green hills dotted with quaint villages and emblematic castles. To the west, the Irish coastline emerges, depicted with rugged cliffs and verdant landscapes. Symbolic elements include a Tudor rose gently floating on the water near England, a Welsh dragon subtly etched into the hillside of Wales, and a shamrock delicately placed near the Irish coast. The sky above is a serene pastel blue, with soft, watercolor clouds adding depth and a sense of historical grandeur. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peaceful transition and the unification of the three regions under James VI's rule, serving as a visual mnemonic for the correct answer: England, Wales, and Ireland.
