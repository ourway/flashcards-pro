A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting William the Conqueror. The scene is set on a windswept, grassy hill overlooking the battlefield of Hastings. William, centered in the frame, is depicted as a strong, determined leader in full Norman battle armor, his helmet adorned with a subtle, stylized lion crest. He holds a long Norman kite shield emblazoned with a simple, yet elegant, heraldic design. The battlefield below is suggested by subtle earth tones and hints of clashing armies, avoiding any graphic or violent details. The sky above is a mix of blues and grays, hinting at the historical weight of the event. In the far background, a stylized representation of the English Channel is visible, with Norman longships approaching the shore. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, grays, and browns, with touches of red and gold in William's attire to subtly evoke the colors of the UK flag. The composition emphasizes William's commanding presence and the historical significance of his conquest, aiming to create a visually memorable representation of his title: William the Conqueror.
