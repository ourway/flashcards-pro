A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting London's West End at twilight. The color palette should lean towards pastel variations of the UK flag colors â€“ soft blues, reds, and creams. The composition centers around a street scene, showcasing several theater facades, each distinct in architectural style, reminiscent of classic British theaters. The marquees should be brightly lit, with generic names of plays that don't correspond to real shows, to avoid any copyright issues, and represent the lively atmosphere. The street is bustling with elegantly dressed pedestrians, depicted as silhouettes to maintain focus on the theaters. A classic red double-decker bus is subtly placed in the background, adding to the London ambiance. Above the street, a stylized constellation of stars forms a subtle, ethereal crown, symbolizing the West End as the "crown jewel" of London's theater scene. The overall mood should be magical and inviting, capturing the excitement and cultural richness of the West End theater district. The image should evoke a sense of wonder and sophistication, emphasizing the area's cultural significance.
