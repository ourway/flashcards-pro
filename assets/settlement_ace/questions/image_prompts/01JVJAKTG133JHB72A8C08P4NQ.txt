A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a large, frosted birthday cake adorned with seventy lit candles. The cake sits on a sturdy, wooden table in a cozy, sunlit room. A single, ornate British scale of justice rests gently on the table next to the cake, subtly suggesting the legal context. The color palette is primarily pastel, with soft blues, pinks, and yellows. The candles are burning brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene. Around the base of the cake, delicate sugar flowers are arranged, each representing a year of life. A single, unlit candle lies horizontally on the cake, symbolizing the end of the juror's service. The background is softly blurred, hinting at a traditional British countryside scene through a window. The overall composition is designed to evoke a sense of finality and the passage of time, visually reinforcing the concept that jury service eligibility ends before the age of 75. The scene should be peaceful and contemplative, with a focus on details that subtly communicate the message without being overtly literal. The style should be reminiscent of classic children's book illustrations.
