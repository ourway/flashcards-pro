A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the River Thames gracefully flowing through the heart of London. The color palette should be predominantly pastel blues, creams, and soft reds, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag. The London Eye stands prominently on the riverbank, its capsules rendered with delicate detail to reflect the ambient light. The river itself should be teeming with activity: small boats, perhaps a traditional Thames barge, and reflections of the city skyline shimmering on the water's surface. The composition should center on the river and the London Eye, with the river winding into the distance, suggesting its extensive reach across the landscape. The sky above should be a soft, hazy blue, with gentle brushstrokes indicating the movement of clouds. The overall mood should be serene and picturesque, evoking a sense of the historical and cultural significance of the River Thames as it courses through the iconic cityscape. The style should be reminiscent of classic British landscape paintings, emphasizing realism and atmospheric perspective.
