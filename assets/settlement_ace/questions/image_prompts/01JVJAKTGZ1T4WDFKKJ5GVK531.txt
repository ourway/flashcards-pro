A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is the Union Flag (Union Jack) of the United Kingdom, depicted waving gently in a soft breeze. The flag's vibrant red, white, and blue are rendered in pastel shades, giving it a serene and historical feel. To the left of the flag, slightly faded and translucent, is the English flag with St. George's Cross. To the right, similarly styled, is the Scottish flag with St. Andrew's Cross. Below the Union Jack and slightly off-center, a majestic Welsh Dragon is depicted, its scales shimmering with a subtle, iridescent quality. However, the dragon is intentionally separated and positioned just outside the direct composition of the Union Flag, symbolizing its absence from the flag's design. The background features a soft, diffused light suggesting a historical context. The overall composition conveys a sense of national identity and historical accuracy, emphasizing that while the Welsh Dragon is a significant symbol of Wales, it is not incorporated into the Union Flag. The art style aims for clarity and memorability, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements.
