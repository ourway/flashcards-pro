A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9, depicting a serene Scottish loch under a pastel blue sky. In the center of the frame, a majestic, yet gentle, white swan gracefully glides across the calm water, leaving subtle ripples in its wake. The swan's body forms a distinct diagonal shape, mirroring the cross of St. Andrew. Behind the swan, subtly emerging from the loch's mist, is a faint, ethereal rendering of the Scottish flag â€“ a white diagonal cross upon a field of light blue. The colors should lean towards a pastel palette, with the blue of the sky and the flag a soft, calming hue. Around the edges of the loch, watercolor washes of heather and thistle, rendered in muted purples and greens, create a sense of the Scottish landscape. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peace and tranquility, with the swan as the central focal point, subtly reminding the viewer of the diagonal cross of St. Andrew. The art style should be realistic and detailed, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and leaning towards a classic watercolor aesthetic. The image should not contain text or numbers.
