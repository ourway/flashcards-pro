A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, rendered in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a dramatic naval battle scene set on a turbulent, dark blue sea. To the left and slightly in the background, represent the Spanish Armada: large, imposing galleons with high castles fore and aft, their sails emblazoned with the Spanish flag (red and gold). These ships should appear heavily armored, reflecting light off their metallic surfaces, hinting at the "armored" nature of the Armada. To the right, and slightly closer to the viewer, depict the smaller, more agile English ships, flying the flag of St. George. The English ships should be strategically positioned, firing cannons that emit puffs of white smoke. The sky above is a stormy mix of dark greys and blues, with a sliver of light breaking through the clouds to illuminate the English ships, symbolizing their eventual victory. The overall color palette should lean towards the cool tones of the UK flag (blues and whites), with accents of red and gold on the Spanish ships. The composition should emphasize the contrast in size and maneuverability between the two fleets, highlighting the strategic advantage of the English navy. The waves should be rendered with meticulous detail, conveying the power and unpredictability of the sea. The overall atmosphere should be one of dramatic tension and historical significance, capturing the pivotal moment of the English victory against the Spanish Armada in 1588.
