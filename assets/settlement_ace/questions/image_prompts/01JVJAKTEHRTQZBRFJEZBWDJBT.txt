A 16:9, landscape-oriented, hand-drawn, watercolour illustration depicting Queen Elizabeth I in a regal, yet contemplative pose. She stands in the centre of the composition, adorned in a magnificent, but simplified, Tudor-era gown with red and gold accents, reminiscent of the Tudor dynasty colours, set against a backdrop of muted pastel blues and creams. Her expression should be serene and intelligent, with a hint of melancholy. In her left hand, she gently holds a single, white Tudor rose, symbolizing purity and England. To her right, a faint, ethereal image of a royal crown hovers, subtly suggesting the throne, but without any figures vying for it. The background should feature a stylised, simplified image of the Tower of London in the distance, rendered in soft, pastel colours. The overall art style should be realistic but with a painterly quality, evoking a sense of history and quiet dignity. The lighting should be soft and diffused, highlighting the Queen's face and the Tudor rose. The image should convey the idea of a powerful, unmarried queen, her reign defined by her singular dedication to her country, without the need for an heir.
