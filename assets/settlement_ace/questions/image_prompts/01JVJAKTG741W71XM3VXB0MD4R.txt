A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a somber medieval English landscape. The composition is centered on a village nestled in a valley, with thatched-roof houses and a stone church featuring a prominent spire. A dark, swirling cloud, predominantly black and deep indigo with hints of sickly green, ominously looms over the village, casting long, dramatic shadows. The cloud's edges are blurred, suggesting its pervasive and deadly nature. Below the cloud, the fields are depicted in muted browns and yellows, with scattered, lifeless trees. Some villagers are shown in the foreground, their faces etched with fear and despair, some kneeling in prayer. The color palette should be largely pastel but with a strong contrast to the dark cloud. The overall mood is one of foreboding and devastation, emphasizing the "Black Death" aspect of the plague. The art style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and emotional depth, reminiscent of classic medieval illustrations. The sky in the background transitions to a lighter grey, creating a stark contrast and highlighting the encroaching darkness.
