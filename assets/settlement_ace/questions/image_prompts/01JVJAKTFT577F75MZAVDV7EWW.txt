A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style (16:9 ratio). The central focus is a slightly desaturated, pastel-toned courtroom scene. Dominating the foreground is an empty jury box, depicted with wooden panels and padded seating in muted blues and grays. A single spotlight shines directly onto one of the seats, highlighting a faint, symbolic shadow of a person wearing striped prison clothing. The shadow is subtly transparent, almost like a ghost, suggesting a past presence rather than a current one. Behind the jury box, the judge's bench is partially visible, draped in a dark blue cloth reminiscent of the UK flag's shade of blue, adding a touch of somber formality. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, grays, and creams, creating a sense of solemnity and impartiality. The background consists of blurry figures representing lawyers and court officials, rendered in soft, indistinct strokes to avoid drawing focus from the central element of the empty jury box and the shadow. The lighting is soft and diffused, except for the highlighted jury seat. The style should resemble a classic courtroom sketch, focusing on realism and detail, but with a gentle, watercolor aesthetic.
