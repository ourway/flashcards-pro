A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a split scene representing the distinct roles in a UK courtroom setting. The color palette leans towards pastel blues and reds, subtly evoking the UK flag. On the left side, a group of twelve figures, representing the jury, are intently focused. Each jury member has a magnifying glass, symbolizing their role in examining evidence and determining facts. They are seated around a table with papers scattered, suggesting their deliberation process. The light source highlights their focused expressions. On the right side, a stern-looking judge sits on a high bench, holding a gavel in one hand and a book of law in the other. The judge is bathed in a different light, emphasizing their authority and separate function. Between the two scenes, a symbolic, stylized scale is balanced, representing justice. The scale is tilted very slightly towards the jury's side, subtly suggesting their primary role in determining guilt or innocence, but visually distinct from the judge's side, which represents sentencing. The background is a muted grey, representing the neutrality of the courtroom, allowing the figures and symbolic elements to stand out clearly. The overall composition emphasizes the separation of roles, visually reinforcing that sentencing is not the responsibility of the jury.
