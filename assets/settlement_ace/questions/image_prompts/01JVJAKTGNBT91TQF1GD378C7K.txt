A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a Welsh landscape awakening on the 1st of March. The scene is set in a lush green valley in Wales, with rolling hills dotted with grazing sheep. In the foreground, a young girl in traditional Welsh dress, complete with a tall black hat and red shawl, is pinning a daffodil onto the lapel of an older gentleman. The daffodil should be realistically rendered, showcasing its delicate petals and vibrant yellow hue. The sun is rising, casting a warm, golden glow over the valley, symbolizing the start of a new day and the beginning of spring. In the background, villagers are seen engaging in celebratory activities - children are dancing, musicians are playing traditional Welsh instruments such as harps and fiddles, and a choir is singing. The overall colour palette should be dominated by greens, yellows, and reds, echoing the colours of the Welsh flag and the national flower. The sky should be a soft pastel blue, blending seamlessly with the distant hills. The atmosphere should evoke a sense of joy, community, and cultural pride, capturing the essence of St David's Day.
