A hand-drawn, watercolor-style image depicting a cozy and inviting pub scene centered around a pool table. The pub interior features warm lighting, with soft, diffused light emanating from vintage-style lamps hanging above the pool table. The walls are a muted, pastel blue, adorned with framed pictures of historical British figures and landscapes. The pool table is the focal point, covered in a rich, dark green felt. Two players, a man and a woman, are positioned on opposite sides of the table, engaged in a friendly game. The man is leaning over the table, cue in hand, carefully aiming at a striped ball. The woman is standing upright, observing the game with a relaxed smile. Details such as the chalk on the table, the triangle used to rack the balls, and a pint of beer sitting on a nearby ledge should be clearly visible. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, with accents of red and blue to subtly evoke the colors of the UK flag. The overall composition should create a sense of warmth, camaraderie, and the quintessential British pub atmosphere, emphasizing the social and recreational aspect of playing pool in a traditional setting.
