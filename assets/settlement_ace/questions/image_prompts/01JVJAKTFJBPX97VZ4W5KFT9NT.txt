A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic style, resembling a watercolor painting. The scene depicts a stylized Iron Age settlement in Britain, nestled in a valley with rolling green hills in the background under a pastel blue sky. The focus is on a group of Iron Age people engaged in various activities. In the center, an artisan sits cross-legged near a small, open-air furnace, carefully hammering a piece of glowing metal into a rough, disc-like shape - an early coin. He is surrounded by tools of the trade: a bellows, tongs, and a stone anvil. The people are dressed in simple, earthy-toned woolen garments. To the left, a farmer tends to a small field of wheat, using a primitive plow. To the right, a woman weaves fabric on a loom. Subtle details such as wattle-and-daub huts with thatched roofs, livestock grazing peacefully, and children playing with wooden toys add depth and realism to the scene. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, green, and brown, with touches of red in the embers of the furnace and in the details of the clothing. The composition is balanced, with the coin-making artisan as the central focal point, surrounded by elements representing daily life in Iron Age Britain, effectively illustrating the connection between the people of the Iron Age and the minting of the first coins.
