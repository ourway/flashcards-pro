A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style (16:9 landscape) depicting a balanced seesaw in a serene, pastel-colored park setting. The seesaw's fulcrum is a stylized representation of the Houses of Parliament, rendered in soft greys and whites with a hint of pastel blue in the sky behind it. On one side of the seesaw sits a vintage-style television set with an antenna, its screen blank. On the other side, there's an antique radio with visible knobs and a speaker grill. Both the radio and the television are rendered in pastel shades of red, white, and blue, reminiscent of the UK flag. Flanking the seesaw are stylized bushes trimmed into the shapes of various political symbols (e.g., a stylized dove, a rising sun), all subtly different but equal in size and visual weight. The ground beneath the seesaw is lush green grass, and the overall scene is bathed in soft, diffused sunlight, creating a sense of fairness and balance. The entire image should convey a sense of equilibrium and impartiality, emphasizing that both radio and television provide equal platforms.
