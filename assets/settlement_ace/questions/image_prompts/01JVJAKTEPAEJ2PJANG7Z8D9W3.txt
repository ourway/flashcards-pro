A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant procession of pilgrims traversing a rolling English countryside. The composition is centered on the winding path they follow, leading towards the distant, majestic silhouette of Canterbury Cathedral, bathed in the soft, golden light of a late afternoon sun. The pilgrims themselves are a diverse group, their clothing reflecting the styles of the late 14th century: woolen tunics, simple gowns, and varied headwear in muted earth tones punctuated by the occasional splash of blue or red. Geoffrey Chaucer is subtly included, sketching in a notebook as he walks alongside the pilgrims. In the sky above the pilgrims, subtle, translucent Roman numerals "MCD" (representing 1400) are subtly woven into the cloud formations, almost as if part of the natural sky. The landscape is lush and green, dotted with wildflowers in pastel shades, and a meandering river reflects the sky. The overall color palette leans towards the UK flag's colors, but with a gentler, more muted pastel effect, using soft blues, faded reds, and creams to create a sense of historical distance and tranquility. The artwork should evoke a sense of journey, history, and the passage of time, with a focus on realistic depiction of characters and landscape.
