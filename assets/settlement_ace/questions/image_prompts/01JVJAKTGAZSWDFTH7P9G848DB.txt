A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting the island of Great Britain, viewed from a slightly elevated perspective, as if floating gently above the ocean. The landmass is rendered in soft, pastel greens and browns, subtly differentiating the terrains of England, Wales, and Scotland, without harsh dividing lines. England occupies the lower, larger portion of the island, gradually transitioning into the mountainous regions of Wales to the west and the rugged highlands of Scotland to the north. The surrounding ocean is painted in calming shades of blue, with gentle ripples suggesting a serene atmosphere. The overall composition should emphasize the unified nature of the island, highlighting how these three countries form a single, cohesive landmass. The artwork should evoke a sense of geographical accuracy and peaceful coexistence, avoiding any political or nationalistic symbols. The color palette leans towards the pastel variants of the colors of the UK flag (red, white and blue), creating a harmonious and educational visual. The style is realistic but not photographic, maintaining a gentle, artistic quality suitable for educational purposes. The image should be centered within the 16:9 frame, drawing the viewer's eye directly to the outline of Great Britain.
