A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a majestic, stylized guardian angel hovering protectively over a collection of simplified national flags representing the member countries of the Council of Europe. The angel, rendered with soft, flowing lines and a compassionate expression, wears robes in shades of pastel blue and white, reminiscent of the UK flag. Its wings are large and feathered, with subtle gradients of light grey and pale gold. Below, the flags are arranged in a semi-circle, each clearly identifiable by its distinct colors and patterns, but simplified to avoid overcrowding. The background is a soft, diffused pastel sky with gentle gradations of pink, purple, and blue, evoking a sense of peace and security. The angel's hands are gently extended downwards, as if bestowing a blessing or offering protection. The overall composition should be balanced and harmonious, with the angel as the central focal point, emphasizing its role as a protector. The colors should be predominantly pastel, creating a calming and reassuring atmosphere. The image should convey a sense of responsibility, care, and guardianship, effectively illustrating the Council of Europe's duty to protect and promote human rights within its member countries.
