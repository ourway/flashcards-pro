A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a serene Italian landscape under a pastel-colored sky. The foreground showcases a quaint, sun-drenched Tuscan villa with terracotta roof tiles, surrounded by vibrant, flowering lavender bushes. In the middle ground, rolling hills dotted with olive groves lead the eye towards the iconic Duomo of Florence, its dome rendered in delicate detail. A stork gracefully flies above the Duomo, carrying a small, intricately wrapped bundle of pastel pink and blue fabric, symbolizing birth and new beginnings. The overall color palette leans towards soft blues, gentle pinks, and muted greens, reminiscent of the UK flag but in a softened, pastel tone. The composition is carefully balanced, drawing the viewer's attention to the villa and the distant Florence skyline, subtly hinting at the birthplace of Florence Nightingale. The illustration should evoke a sense of tranquility and historical significance, connecting the visual elements of Italian architecture, landscape, and the symbolic stork to the memory of Florence Nightingale's birth in Italy.
