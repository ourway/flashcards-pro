A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the gradual separation of Britain from mainland Europe approximately 10,000 years ago. The scene is split into two distinct sections, visually representing the change over time. The left side of the image shows a continuous landmass connecting what is now Great Britain to the European continent, covered in glacial ice and sparse vegetation, indicative of the last ice age. Woolly mammoths and early humans can be seen traversing this land bridge. The right side of the image shows the same geographical area thousands of years later. The English Channel has formed, separating Britain from Europe. Rising sea levels are evident, with the melting glacial ice contributing to the water. Lush, green vegetation now covers both sides of the channel. Early human settlements are visible on both the British and European coastlines, now using boats for transportation. The sky transitions from a cold, grey tone on the left to a warmer, pastel blue with fluffy white clouds on the right, symbolizing the change in climate. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel blues, greens, and whites, with hints of earthy browns and greys to represent the landscape and the passage of time. The composition should focus on the central area where the landmass is visibly splitting, emphasizing the creation of the English Channel.
