A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9, depicting a British King seated on a majestic throne within a grand hall reminiscent of Westminster Abbey. Bathed in soft, diffused light filtering through stained-glass windows, the King wears a regal purple robe adorned with gold embroidery and the Imperial State Crown. A single, radiant beam of golden light descends from the heavens, illuminating the crown and the King's head, subtly suggesting divine favor. Above the King, a stylized dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, is depicted with outstretched wings, further reinforcing the idea of divine appointment. The color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, gold, and purple, echoing the UK flag's hues while maintaining a gentle, educational tone. The overall composition should convey a sense of solemnity and divine authority, with the King as the central focus, subtly linked to the heavens through the symbolic light and dove. The throne is intricately detailed, showcasing the craftsmanship of British artistry, and the background hall features subtle architectural elements that are inspired by historical UK Royal residencies.
