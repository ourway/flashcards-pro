A vibrant, historically-inspired 2D watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a stylized but realistic depiction of Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII dancing. Catherine, adorned in a rich, deep red and gold Spanish gown with intricate detailing, holds a fan and has a regal bearing. Henry VIII, dressed in his iconic Tudor attire of dark green and gold with puffed sleeves and a jeweled collar, attempts to follow her lead. Their dance is set within a grand, ornate Tudor hall, suggested by partial views of stone arches, tapestries displaying the Spanish flag, and leaded glass windows allowing soft, diffused light to filter in. In the background, a small group of musicians plays traditional Spanish instruments like guitars and castanets, setting the scene for a Spanish Cari√±osa dance. The colour palette should lean toward warm, earthy tones mixed with the crimson and gold of Spanish royalty. Soft, diffused lighting from the windows should create a sense of depth and highlight the textures of the fabrics and architectural details. The style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy while retaining an artistic and painterly feel, resembling an illustration from a history book. No text should be visible. The overall composition should aim to capture the elegance and cultural exchange between the Spanish princess and the English king.
