A hand-drawn, 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting Wallace and Gromit inside a cozy, quintessentially British workshop. The scene is bathed in warm, pastel colors, primarily blues, reds, and creams, reminiscent of the UK flag. Wallace, with his signature cheesy grin, is tinkering with an elaborate, Rube Goldberg-esque contraption made of gears, cogs, springs, and levers. Gromit, ever the observant and intelligent companion, sits attentively beside him, his large, expressive eyes conveying a sense of curiosity and mild concern. The workshop is cluttered with tools, blueprints, and half-finished inventions, all rendered with meticulous detail. A single spotlight shines down on Wallace and Gromit, emphasizing their animated nature and bringing them to life. Shelves in the background are filled with books with titles like "Cheese Making for Beginners" and "Advanced Dog Training." The overall composition suggests a playful, inventive, and heartwarming atmosphere, capturing the essence of Nick Park's animated films. The image should be in 16:9 landscape format, with Wallace and Gromit centered in the frame.
