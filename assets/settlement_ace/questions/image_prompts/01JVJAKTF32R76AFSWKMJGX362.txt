A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, depicting the entrance of a traditional British pub. The color palette should be pastel, with hints of red, white, and blue reminiscent of the UK flag. The pub's exterior is brick, with a dark wooden door and a sign hanging above, displaying a stylized, heraldic lion. Two figures are central to the composition: on the left, a young person, appearing to be around 16 years old, with a slightly hopeful expression, is reaching out with their hand, which holds some money. On the right, a stern-looking but fair bouncer with a neatly trimmed beard and a waistcoat stands firmly, holding up a hand in a "stop" gesture. The bouncer is positioned slightly in front of a partially visible sign that reads "ID Required" in elegant, cursive font. The lighting is soft and diffused, giving the scene a warm and inviting, yet firm, atmosphere. The overall impression is one of polite but unyielding enforcement of the law. The background is slightly blurred to keep the focus on the interaction between the young person and the bouncer. Small details, such as the texture of the brick and wood, should be realistically rendered. The overall mood should be educational and informative, not intimidating.
