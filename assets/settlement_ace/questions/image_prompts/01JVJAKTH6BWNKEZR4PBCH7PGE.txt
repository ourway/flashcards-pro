A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor illustration in a pastel color palette (primarily light blues, soft reds, and muted creams) depicting a central figure resembling Winston Churchill. He is not a direct portrait but an allegorical representation. He stands on a stylized White Cliffs of Dover, rendered in creamy white watercolor with subtle blue shadows. The cliffs serve as a symbolic foundation. Above Churchill, three distinct banners unfurl in the wind. The first banner displays a golden lion rampant, symbolizing courage. The second banner depicts a silhouette of soldiers during the Dunkirk evacuation, representing sacrifice. The third banner shows a steadfast lighthouse beam cutting through a stormy sea, symbolizing unwavering resolve. The sky behind the cliffs transitions from a turbulent, watercolor-washed gray to a hopeful, pastel blue sunrise. The overall composition emphasizes the interconnectedness of courage, sacrifice, and resolve, visually linking them as attributes associated with Churchill. The art style should be reminiscent of classic British wartime posters, with a focus on strong, clear imagery and symbolic representation. Subtle details, such as the texture of the watercolor paper and the delicate rendering of the banners, should enhance the overall artistic quality. The scene should evoke a sense of historical weight and the enduring power of Churchill's leadership.
