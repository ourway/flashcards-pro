A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is the Houses of Parliament in London, depicted with architectural accuracy and bathed in the soft, golden light of a late afternoon. The color palette leans heavily on pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack. In front of the Parliament building, positioned centrally, are two muscular arms, drawn in a classical style reminiscent of Renaissance sculptures, lifting a barbell. The barbell's weights are stylized representations of historical documents, subtly textured to resemble parchment. The left weight has a small crown emblem, while the right weight has the scales of justice. The arms are straining slightly, indicating effort, but are clearly succeeding in lifting the weight. Light shines on the arm muscles, highlighting their definition and power. The sky behind Parliament is a gradient of pastel blues and pinks, creating a calm, authoritative atmosphere. The overall impression should be one of strength, stability, and the careful balance of power, reinforcing the idea of Parliament's increased authority. The style should be realistic and detailed, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements, to give it a serious and educational tone.
