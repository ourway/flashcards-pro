A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting a balanced scale set against a backdrop of rolling green hills typical of the British countryside. The color palette leans heavily on pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the Union Jack. On the left side of the scale, a stylized, simplified representation of the Houses of Parliament, rendered in shades of blue and white, symbolizes the central government. Emanating from the Parliament building are delicate, flowing lines of pastel blue, visually suggesting the flow of funds. On the right side of the scale, a cluster of quaint, pastel-colored houses, representative of local communities, is depicted. From these houses rise soft, red lines, converging to form abstract symbols of taxes (coins, pound signs, etc.), rendered in a light, airy style. The scale itself is made of a polished, light-colored wood, suggesting fairness and balance. The fulcrum of the scale rests on a solid, earthy base, representing the stable foundation of local governance. The overall composition emphasizes the balance between central government funding and local taxes, visually reinforcing their equal importance in funding local authorities. The art style should be realistic but with a gentle, illustrative quality, avoiding harsh lines or overly detailed textures. The intention is to create a serene and memorable image that encapsulates the concept of balanced funding for local authorities.
