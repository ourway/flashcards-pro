A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the iconic landscape of St Andrews, Scotland, renowned as the 'home of golf'. The composition is centered on the famous Swilcan Bridge, a small stone bridge arching gracefully over a burn on the 18th hole of the Old Course. Two figures, a man and a woman dressed in traditional golfing attire from the early 20th century (plus fours, tweed jackets for the man; long skirt and blouse with a knitted vest for the woman) are pausing mid-game on the bridge, looking out over the vast green expanse of the golf course, the man resting his golf club on his shoulder and the woman holding her golf club in her hand. The background features the rolling green hills of the golf course meeting the rugged coastline of the North Sea under a pastel blue sky with soft, scattered white clouds. The sea should be a blend of blues and greens, reflecting the sky, with gentle waves lapping against the shore. In the distance, the historic St Andrews Cathedral ruins stand silhouetted against the sky, adding a sense of history and timelessness to the scene. The colors should primarily consist of pastel blues, greens, and browns, with accents of red and white in the golfers' clothing, subtly evoking the colors of the UK flag. The overall mood is serene and nostalgic, capturing the essence of St Andrews as a place where the traditions of golf are deeply cherished and the sport's history comes alive. The image should be 16:9 ratio.
