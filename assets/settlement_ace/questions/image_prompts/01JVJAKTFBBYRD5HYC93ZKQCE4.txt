A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting two distinct scenes blended seamlessly within a 16:9 landscape format. The left half of the image showcases the Royal Ascot, with horses racing at full gallop on a lush green track. Spectators in elegant attire, including top hats and vibrant dresses, line the stands. A stylised version of the British Royal Standard flag flutters gently atop the grandstand, rendered in pastel shades of blue, red, and white. The right half of the image shifts to the Scottish Grand National, featuring horses jumping over a challenging fence. The backdrop features a quintessential Scottish landscape with rolling green hills and a loch in the distance. A subtle, stylized thistle, a national symbol of Scotland, is incorporated into the foreground near the fence. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues, subtly incorporating the colors of the UK flag without being overtly patriotic. The composition should be balanced, drawing the eye to the central area where the two scenes converge, symbolizing the connection between these prestigious racing events.
