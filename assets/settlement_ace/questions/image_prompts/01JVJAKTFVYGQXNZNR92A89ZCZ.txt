A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting Clement Attlee standing resolutely before the iconic backdrop of the Houses of Parliament in London. Attlee is portrayed with a calm and thoughtful expression, holding a simple, unadorned wooden helm (ship's steering wheel) firmly in his hands, symbolizing his assumption of leadership. The scene is bathed in the soft, pastel hues of a post-war dawn, with the sky transitioning from a deep blue to a gentle pink, hinting at the hope and rebuilding efforts following World War II. The Houses of Parliament are rendered with careful attention to architectural detail, their stone surfaces showing subtle signs of age and resilience. Around Attlee's feet, scattered yet orderly, are blueprints representing post-war reconstruction plans. The overall composition is balanced and symmetrical, emphasizing Attlee's central role and the gravity of the moment. The colour palette should predominantly feature pastel blues, pinks, and creams, subtly echoing the colours of the Union Jack while maintaining a serene and optimistic atmosphere. The style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and quiet determination, capturing the essence of Attlee's leadership during a pivotal time in British history. The image should be 16:9 ratio.
