A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a scene at the edge of a winding country road in the UK. The illustration should feature a vintage-style road sign with a prominent curve symbol, placed firmly into a grassy verge dotted with wildflowers in pastel shades. Emerging from behind the sign is a young person, clearly around 17 years old, with a determined expression. They are astride a classic British motorcycle, a Triumph Bonneville, gleaming in the sunlight. The motorcycle should be painted in classic British racing green, and the young person is wearing a helmet and appropriate riding gear, primarily in shades of blue and red, evoking the colours of the UK flag. A sense of forward motion is conveyed through subtle blurring of the background and the suggestion of wind in the young person's hair (visible beneath the helmet). In the background, rolling hills of the English countryside stretch into the distance under a clear blue sky with soft, fluffy white clouds. The overall composition should convey a sense of youthful freedom, independence, and the open road, with the road sign subtly hinting at the legal aspect of driving. The lighting is bright and optimistic, casting soft shadows that add depth and realism. The entire scene should be rendered with meticulous attention to detail, from the texture of the road surface to the individual blades of grass, using a soft pastel colour palette with accents of red, white, and blue.
