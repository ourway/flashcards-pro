A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting the aftermath of a battle. The scene is set on a rolling green hillside in England, bathed in the soft, diffused light of a late afternoon. In the foreground, a single, vibrant red rose, representing the House of Lancaster, emerges triumphantly from the cracked and weathered surface of a discarded shield. The shield itself is emblazoned with faded heraldic symbols, hinting at past conflicts. Scattered around the rose and shield are broken swords, dented helmets, and torn banners, all rendered with painstaking attention to texture and detail. The colour palette is dominated by earthy tones of greens and browns, contrasted by the striking crimson of the rose. The background features a misty landscape with distant castles and rolling hills, evoking the historical setting of the Wars of the Roses. The composition is centered on the rose and shield, drawing the viewer's eye to the symbol of Lancaster's victory. The overall mood is one of solemnity and resolution, capturing the end of a long and bloody conflict. The soft watercolour technique adds a layer of ethereal beauty to the scene. The discarded shield resembles the UK flag colours.
