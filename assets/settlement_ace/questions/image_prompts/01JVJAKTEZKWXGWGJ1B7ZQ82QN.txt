A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a panoramic view of an Iron Age settlement in Britain. The scene is bathed in the soft, diffused light of a late summer afternoon, with a pastel colour palette dominated by earthy tones, greens, and muted blues reminiscent of the UK landscape. The composition is centered around three distinct areas. To the left, a group of farmers are harvesting crops of wheat and barley in a field, using primitive iron tools. Their clothing is simple, made from woven fabrics in natural dyes. In the centre, a cluster of craft workers are engaged in various activities: a blacksmith hammering iron on an anvil, a potter shaping clay on a wheel, and a weaver working at a loom. The workshop is a basic, thatched structure. To the right, a group of warriors stand guard, clad in leather armour and wielding iron swords and shields. They are positioned on a small hill overlooking the settlement, conveying a sense of protection. The background features rolling hills, forests, and a distant river, all rendered in soft, watercolour washes. The overall impression is one of a thriving, self-sufficient community, highlighting the interconnectedness of farming, craftsmanship, and defense in Iron Age society. The image should evoke a sense of history and authenticity, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements.
