A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour illustration depicting a stylized scene of the UK electoral process, focusing on the concept of proportional representation. The scene is set against a backdrop of rolling green hills reminiscent of the English countryside, subtly incorporating the red, white, and blue colours of the Union Jack in the wildflowers scattered across the landscape. In the center, visualize a large pie chart, meticulously divided into various colored segments, each representing a different political party. The size of each segment is directly proportional to the number of people standing near it, holding symbolic items related to their party's platform (e.g., a book for education, a stethoscope for healthcare, a cogwheel for industry). The people are diverse, reflecting the multicultural nature of the UK. Radiating outwards from the pie chart are pathways leading to the Houses of Parliament in the distance. The pathways vary in width, corresponding to the segment size of the pie chart they originate from, visually representing how the proportion of votes translates into representation in Parliament. The overall style should be realistic yet inviting, with soft, pastel colours dominating the palette, creating a sense of fairness, balance, and democratic participation. The image should evoke a sense of order and proportionality, emphasizing the core principle of the proportional representation system.
