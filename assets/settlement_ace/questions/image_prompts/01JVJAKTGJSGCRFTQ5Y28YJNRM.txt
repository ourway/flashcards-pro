A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The scene depicts a serene, pastel-colored landscape under a pale blue sky. In the center, a stylized, simplified British flag (red, white, and blue ribbons intertwined) unfurls gently. One end of the flag transforms into a caduceus symbol (medical staff), subtly representing the National Health Service (NHS). The other end of the flag flows into a network of interconnected houses and buildings, symbolizing a comprehensive social security system for all. The houses are diverse in style, representing the different people in the UK. Soft, warm light bathes the scene, creating a sense of hope and security. The background features rolling green hills dotted with sheep, characteristic of the British countryside. The overall composition should evoke a sense of national unity and well-being, emphasizing the post-war welfare reforms. The watercolors should blend seamlessly, creating a gentle and harmonious aesthetic. The colors should have a pastel tone, where the red is a light rose, the blue is a sky blue and the white is an ivory white.
