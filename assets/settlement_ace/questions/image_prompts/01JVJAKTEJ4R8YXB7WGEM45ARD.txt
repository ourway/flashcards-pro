A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour painting in a realistic style (not cartoonish or abstract), depicting a serene, rolling landscape representing the island of Great Britain. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades, subtly incorporating the red, white, and blue of the Union Jack. The composition should be focused on three distinct, yet connected, geographical regions. To represent England, a quintessential English countryside scene is depicted in the lower central portion of the image: rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep, thatched-roof cottages, and a meandering river. To the left, representing Wales, a majestic, mist-covered mountain range rises, complete with cascading waterfalls and ancient stone ruins nestled within the valleys. To the right, representing Scotland, a rugged, heather-covered moorland stretches towards the horizon, with a glimpse of a tranquil loch reflecting the sky. All three regions seamlessly blend into each other, sharing the same island base. A symbolic, ancient oak tree stands at the heart of the island, its roots intertwining through all three regions, representing the shared history and unity of England, Scotland, and Wales. The sky above should be a soft, pastel blue, with wispy clouds hinting at the diverse weather patterns across Great Britain. The entire image should evoke a sense of peace, history, and natural beauty, emphasizing the interconnectedness of the three countries.
