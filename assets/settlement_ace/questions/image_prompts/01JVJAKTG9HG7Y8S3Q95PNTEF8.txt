A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic historical paintings. The scene depicts Robert the Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. The composition should be centered on Robert the Bruce, portrayed as a strong, determined leader in shining armour (but with subtle signs of wear and tear from battle), holding a Scottish Claymore sword aloft, not in a moment of attack but in a stance of firm resolve and leadership. Beneath him, the Scottish army, represented by a sea of warriors in kilts and chainmail, advances with unwavering determination. In the background, the English army is visible, appearing less organized and faltering. The landscape should feature the rolling hills and rivers of Bannockburn, Scotland. The sky is overcast, suggesting a dramatic and pivotal moment. The color palette primarily consists of muted blues and greys for the sky and armor, contrasting with the earthy greens and browns of the landscape and the deep reds and yellows of the Scottish banners. Symbolic elements include a thistle subtly incorporated into Robert the Bruce's helmet and a depiction of the Scottish Saltire flag flying proudly above the troops. The overall tone should be heroic and inspiring, capturing the essence of Scottish resilience and the significance of Robert the Bruce's leadership in securing victory.
