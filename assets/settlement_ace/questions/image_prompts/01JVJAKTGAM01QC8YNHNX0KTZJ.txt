A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a majestic Canadian landscape under a pastel blue sky. Dominating the center is a stylized, yet realistic, maple leaf in varying shades of pastel red and white, its veins intricately detailed. Superimposed subtly within the maple leaf's silhouette is a faint outline of the Canadian Parliament Buildings in Ottawa, rendered in pale grey and white washes to give a ghostly, ethereal quality. In the lower center foreground, a small, ornate crown, colored in royal blue and gold, rests gently on a bed of stylized wheat stalks, symbolizing Canada's connection to the British monarchy and the Commonwealth. The background features rolling hills of lush green and pastel yellow fields fading into the distance, evoking a sense of vastness and prosperity. The overall color palette leans towards pastel variations of red, white, and blue, reminiscent of the Union Jack, subtly reinforcing the UK connection. The art style should be realistic with soft edges, avoiding harsh lines or overly vibrant colors, creating a serene and educational visual aid.
