A hand-drawn, realistic, 2D watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape ratio depicting a vibrant Diwali night scene. The central focus is on a row of traditional clay diya lamps, each flickering with a warm, golden light, placed on a windowsill overlooking a stylized British cityscape. The cityscape silhouette includes recognizable landmarks such as the Big Ben clock tower and the Shard, subtly integrated to represent the UK setting. Above the cityscape, the night sky is filled with bursts of colourful fireworks in pastel shades of pink, blue, and yellow, illuminating soft, smoky trails. The windowsill is adorned with marigold garlands and intricate rangoli patterns in reds and oranges. The overall colour palette leans towards a pastel scheme, with the warm yellows and oranges of the diya lights contrasting against the cooler blues and purples of the night sky. The style should evoke a sense of celebration, peace, and cultural integration. The image must be strictly 2D and not 3D and should not include any text or numbers. The image should help users remember the answer and visualize the relationship to the question.
