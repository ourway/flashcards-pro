A watercolour painting in a realistic style, ratio 16:9, depicting a scene from Iron Age Britain. The scene is set in a verdant valley, bisected by a clear, shallow river. Dominating the center is a blacksmith's forge, constructed of rough-hewn stone. The blacksmith, a muscular figure clad in simple woolen garments of muted browns and greens, is hammering a glowing red-hot iron sword on an anvil. Sparks fly upwards, illuminating his focused face. To the left of the forge, a small group of villagers are gathered, their faces reflecting a mixture of awe and anticipation as they watch the blacksmith at work. Some hold simple farming tools, highlighting the contrast between the old ways and the new technology. In the background, rolling hills are dotted with Iron Age roundhouses, their thatched roofs blending into the landscape. Sheep graze peacefully on the hillsides. The sky above is a soft, pastel blue, with hints of pink and orange near the horizon, suggesting either dawn or dusk. The overall colour palette leans towards earthy tones, with pops of red and orange from the forge fire and the heated iron. The composition is designed to draw the viewer's eye to the blacksmith and his forge, emphasizing the transformative power of ironworking. The image should evoke a sense of the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Iron Age people.
