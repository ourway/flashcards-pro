A watercolour painting in a realistic style, ratio 16:9, depicting a close-up of a vibrant red poppy field under a soft, overcast sky, reminiscent of the British Isles. The poppies should be densely clustered in the center, their delicate petals rendered with subtle variations in shade and texture. The background should subtly fade into a muted green and brown, representing the fields of Flanders. A gentle breeze is implied by the slight swaying of the poppy heads. The colour palette should be dominated by the vivid red of the poppies, contrasted by the greens and browns of the field, and the soft greys and blues of the sky. The overall feel should be one of solemn beauty and remembrance. The composition should draw the viewer's eye to the heart of the poppy field, creating a sense of depth and immersion. The style must be a realistic watercolour, with visible brushstrokes and a slight blurring of edges to evoke a dreamlike quality. The poppies are the central subject and should be richly detailed, with the light reflecting off their petals. The image should evoke a sense of peace and reflection, hinting at the sacrifices made in times of war and the enduring symbol of remembrance. The colours are mainly red, green and brown with a hint of blue.
