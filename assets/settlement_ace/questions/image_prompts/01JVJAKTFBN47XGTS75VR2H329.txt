A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a vibrant depiction of two distinct coastal landscapes merging into one. On the left side, illustrating Norway, towering, snow-capped fjords rise dramatically from a deep blue, choppy sea. A single, long Viking ship with a red and white striped sail (resembling the UK flag colours) is depicted sailing out from the mouth of one of the fjords. The ship features a detailed dragon head prow. On the right side, representing Denmark, a flat, green, pastoral landscape extends towards a calm, pale blue sea. Another Viking ship, similar to the first but with a more simplistic design and pastel blue sail, is sailing away from the Danish coast. The sky above is a gradient of pastel blues and pinks, with subtle hints of sunrise. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, interspersed with the strong red and blue tones of the UK flag. The composition emphasizes the contrast between the Norwegian fjords and the Danish flatlands, visually linking them as the origin points of the Viking voyages. The ships should appear historically accurate, with visible details of their construction, such as wooden planks and rope rigging. Small details, such as seabirds flying overhead and waves gently lapping against the shores, add to the realism and atmosphere. No text is present in the image.
