A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a diverse group of people standing in line to vote. The composition is centered, filling a 16:9 landscape ratio. The group comprises individuals of various ethnicities and ages, representing UK citizens, Commonwealth citizens, and Irish Republic citizens residing in the UK. Each person holds a stylized ballot paper, the papers are coloured in pastel blue, pink and white. At the front of the line, a ballot box is adorned with a subtle, artistic representation of the UK flag (a pastel union jack subtly painted on the side). The scene takes place in front of a classic British building, such as a town hall or a polling station, with architectural details rendered in a realistic watercolor style. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of red, white, and blue, reminiscent of the UK flag but in a softer, more inviting tone. Sunlight gently illuminates the scene, casting soft shadows that emphasize the importance and solemnity of the act of voting. The sky overhead is a clear, pastel blue, with a few fluffy white clouds. The overall feel should be inclusive, peaceful, and representative of the democratic process in the UK.
