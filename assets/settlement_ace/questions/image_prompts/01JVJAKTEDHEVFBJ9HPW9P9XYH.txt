A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a sweeping, idealized English landscape under a soft, pastel-colored sky. The scene is dominated by gently rolling green hills dotted with clumps of mature trees, carefully placed to create picturesque views. A serpentine lake, reflecting the sky, winds through the landscape, adding depth and tranquility. In the mid-ground, a classical-style country house sits elegantly, seemingly nestled within the natural curves of the land. Focus should be on the naturalness of the landscape, achieved through careful planning and artful manipulation of the terrain. Subtle undulations in the land, strategically placed trees, and the curving lake all contribute to the illusion of untouched beauty. A lone figure, dressed in 18th-century attire, stands on a small rise, surveying the landscape with a satisfied expression; this is a subtle representation of Lancelot 'Capability' Brown. The overall color palette should be dominated by greens, blues, and soft browns, with touches of white in the clouds and architecture, evoking a sense of serene beauty and the harmonious integration of nature and design. The composition should emphasize the vastness and order of the landscape, creating a sense of idealized English countryside.
