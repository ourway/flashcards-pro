A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical tapestries, depicting a pivotal moment from the Battle of Hastings. The central focus is on the clash between Norman and Saxon forces, with King Harold depicted falling, struck by an arrow. The overall color palette leans heavily into pastel blues, reds, and creams, evoking the tones of aged, well-preserved embroidery. The composition should emulate the style of the Bayeux Tapestry, with a frieze-like arrangement of figures and horses across the 16:9 canvas. Small details, such as the stitching pattern along the top and bottom edges, should further enhance the impression of an embroidered artwork. The background features a stylized rendering of the English countryside, subtly incorporating elements of both English and Norman heraldry â€“ a stylized English rose alongside a Norman lion. The image should be filled with action and movement, capturing the chaos of battle, but rendered with a sense of historical accuracy and artistic flair. The sky is a pale, washed-out blue, suggesting the passage of time and the age of the tapestry. The overall impression should be one of a valuable historical artifact, a visual reminder of the Battle of Hastings and the Bayeux Tapestry itself.
