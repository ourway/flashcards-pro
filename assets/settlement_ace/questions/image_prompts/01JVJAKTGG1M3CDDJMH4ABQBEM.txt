A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a classic storybook illustration, should be created. The scene is split into two distinct but interconnected halves, using a pastel colour palette with subtle hints of red, white, and blue to evoke the UK flag. The left side of the image depicts a serene, snow-dusted stable scene at night. Soft, warm light emanates from within, illuminating a newborn baby Jesus lying in a manger, surrounded by Mary, Joseph, and gentle farm animals. A bright star shines overhead, casting a celestial glow. This side represents Christmas. The right side of the image depicts a sunrise over a rolling green hillside. On the crest of the hill stands a simple wooden cross, draped with a white cloth. At the foot of the cross, spring flowers such as lilies and daffodils are blooming vibrantly. This side represents Easter. A winding path connects the stable scene on the left to the cross on the hillside on the right, symbolizing the journey of Jesus's life. The overall composition is balanced, with the two scenes mirroring each other in terms of visual weight and complexity, creating a harmonious and easily memorable image. The style is gentle and reverent, appropriate for the subject matter and educational context.
