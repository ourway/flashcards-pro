A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, rendered in a 16:9 landscape format. The scene depicts a historical representation of the British Parliament, focusing on the symbolic power dynamic between the House of Lords and the House of Commons. In the foreground, a group of Lords are depicted, clad in ornate, historically accurate armor, embellished with subtle gold and silver details. Their armor should appear imposing and grand, reflecting their past authority. They stand on a slightly elevated platform, looking down upon a larger group of commoners situated in the background, representing the House of Commons. The commoners are dressed in simpler, earth-toned clothing, conveying their comparatively lesser status. The backdrop features a stylized representation of the Houses of Parliament, with the architectural details softened to avoid overwhelming the central figures. The color palette should primarily consist of muted blues, reds, and creams, reminiscent of the UK flag and lending a historical gravitas to the scene. The lighting suggests a bright, overcast day in London, with soft shadows adding depth and dimension. The overall composition emphasizes the vertical height of the Lords and their commanding presence, visually reinforcing the historical truth that the House of Lords was once more powerful than the House of Commons. The artistic style should evoke classic historical illustrations, with a focus on detail and accuracy in depicting the clothing and setting.
