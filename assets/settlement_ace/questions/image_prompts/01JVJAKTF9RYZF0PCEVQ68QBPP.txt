A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a regal Mary, Queen of Scots, kneeling in prayer within a grand, gothic cathedral. The color palette leans heavily on the deep blues and reds of the Scottish flag, with accents of gold and white to emphasize her royal status. Mary is adorned in a rich, crimson velvet gown embroidered with thistles and roses, and a delicate lace veil covers her auburn hair. Light streams through stained-glass windows depicting scenes from the Bible, illuminating her face with a soft, reverent glow. Her hands are clasped tightly, and a rosary with a prominent crucifix is entwined within her fingers. The background features intricate architectural details of the cathedral, including pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and ornate carvings. Subtle symbolic elements include a papal tiara subtly reflected in a polished silver chalice nearby and a distant view through an open archway revealing the Vatican dome on the horizon. The overall composition conveys a sense of deep devotion and her strong allegiance to Catholicism, contrasting sharply with the Protestant Reformation sweeping across Britain at the time. The 16:9 ratio focuses the viewer's attention on Mary's central figure within the cathedral's expansive space.
