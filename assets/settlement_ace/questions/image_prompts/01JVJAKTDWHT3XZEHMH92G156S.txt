A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour painting in a realistic style, depicting a grand, celestial coronation scene. The art style should evoke a sense of historical importance and divine providence. In the center, a kneeling King is receiving a crown. The crown is not being placed by another person, but by a ray of golden light emanating from the heavens above, symbolizing God's appointment. Above the King, subtle, ethereal figures representing angels or divine entities are visible, their forms suggested by soft, pastel-colored light and flowing robes. The scene is set within a grand, ancient cathedral, implied by soaring arches and stained-glass windows rendered in muted blues, reds, and golds, echoing the colors of the UK flag. The light from the heavens illuminates the king, highlighting his face with reverence and solemnity. The colour palette should be pastel and light, creating a sense of serenity and holiness. The background features a subtly suggested British landscape seen through the cathedral windows, hinting at the kingdom the King is destined to rule. The composition should focus on the central act of the coronation, emphasizing the light and the divine connection. There should be no text or numbers in the image, only visual elements. The image ratio is 16:9, landscape orientation.
