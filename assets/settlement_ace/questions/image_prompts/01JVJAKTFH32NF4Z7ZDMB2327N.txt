A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, 16:9 landscape. The central focus is a grand, stylized British Parliament building depicted in soft pastel hues, primarily blues, pinks and creams. Emanating from the right side of the building, bathed in warm sunlight, is a faint, almost ethereal silhouette of the same building. This shadow-building is slightly offset and colored in deeper shades of blue and grey. Inside the sunlit building, tiny, almost imperceptible figures are arranged as if in session. The shadow-building also contains similar figures, but they are posed in a mirroring fashion to those in the sunlit building, subtly implying that they are mimicking or 'shadowing' the activities inside the main Parliament. The overall composition suggests a direct visual analogy between the primary government and its opposition, the "Shadow Cabinet", with the shadow perfectly mimicking the source. The sky above is a gentle, watercolor wash of pastel pink and blue, enhancing the dreamlike, educational quality of the image.
