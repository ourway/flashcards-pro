A delicately water-colored, 16:9 landscape illustration depicting a "Children's Hearings System" in Scotland. The central focus is a circular table in a bright, airy room. Around the table, pastel-colored chairs are occupied by a diverse group of individuals: a child with a concerned but hopeful expression, a social worker with a kind face, a supportive family member (perhaps a grandmother), and two members of the Children's Panel, who are dressed in muted, professional attire. Soft light filters through a large window behind the table, casting gentle shadows. The room is decorated with subtle Scottish motifs â€“ a stylized thistle pattern on the wallpaper and a muted tartan rug on the floor. On the table, instead of harsh legal documents, there are colourful building blocks and a picture book, symbolizing the focus on the child's well-being and development. The overall color palette consists of soft blues, gentle pinks, and creamy yellows, reminiscent of a calming sunrise. The composition should evoke a sense of warmth, empathy, and restorative justice, highlighting the supportive and child-centered approach of the Scottish system. The art style should be realistic, but with a gentle, hand-painted feel, emphasizing the human element and care involved in the process.
