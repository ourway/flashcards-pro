A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a grand medieval hall bathed in soft light. The scene is centered on a distinguished scribe, dressed in deep blue and crimson robes reminiscent of royal colours, meticulously writing on parchment. The scribe is seated at a sturdy oak table, illuminated by candlelight, quill in hand. The hall itself features stone walls adorned with tapestries depicting scenes of English heraldry, subtly incorporating the red and white of the St. George's Cross. In the background, silhouetted figures representing members of the royal court and Parliament are engaged in hushed discussions. Scattered around the hall are open books and scrolls, symbolizing the growing importance of written English. A single, prominent rose, a Tudor rose, lies delicately on the table beside the scribe, subtly hinting at English identity. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel shades, with accents of deep blue, crimson, and gold to evoke a sense of historical significance and regal authority. The composition should emphasize the scribe as the central figure, representing the shift towards English in official documentation. The light and shadow play to create depth and highlight the importance of the moment.
