A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a serene global assembly. The central focus is a large, stylized world map rendered in pastel blues and greens, symbolizing peace and harmony. Radiating outwards from the map are interconnected, dove-shaped figures, each representing a nation, holding olive branches. The doves are painted in subtle shades of white and grey, creating a sense of unity and shared purpose. The background features a soft, gradient wash of pastel blues and pinks, evoking a sense of tranquility and optimism. Tiny, symbolic shields representing protection and security are subtly incorporated into the dove's wing patterns. The entire composition is designed to convey the idea of international cooperation and the prevention of war. The art style should resemble classic watercolour paintings, with soft edges and delicate details, avoiding any harsh lines or overly bright colours. The overall mood is hopeful and idealistic, reflecting the United Nations' goal of promoting peace and security.
