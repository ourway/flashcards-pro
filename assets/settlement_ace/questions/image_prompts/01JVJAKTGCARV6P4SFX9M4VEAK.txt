A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic book illustrations. The scene is set in a dimly lit, Victorian-era study, bookshelves overflowing with leather-bound volumes lining the back wall. Dominating the center is a distinguished gentleman, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, seated at a large wooden desk, quill pen in hand, poised above a manuscript. He has a thoughtful expression, his brow furrowed slightly in concentration. The color palette leans towards muted, pastel tones, with hints of red, white, and blue subtly integrated into the room's decor â€“ a red and blue patterned rug, a white porcelain inkwell. A magnifying glass rests on the desk beside the manuscript, hinting at the detective work to come. To the right of Doyle, a shadowy figure, unmistakably Sherlock Holmes in his iconic deerstalker hat and Inverness cape, stands partially obscured by the bookshelf, observing Doyle with an air of quiet contemplation. The overall composition should be balanced, drawing the eye towards the central figure of Doyle while subtly incorporating elements that evoke the world of Sherlock Holmes. The light source is a warm, inviting glow from a desk lamp, casting long shadows and creating a sense of mystery and intrigue.
