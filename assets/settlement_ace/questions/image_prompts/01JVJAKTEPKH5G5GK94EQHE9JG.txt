A whimsical, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The scene centers on a giant, overflowing chocolate bar, its wrapper partially peeled back to reveal golden, shimmering chocolate. Emerging from the chocolate bar is a vibrant, fantastical factory reminiscent of Willy Wonka's, complete with swirling candy cane chimneys and gingerbread-style architecture. A small, inquisitive boy, dressed in slightly tattered but clean clothing, gazes up at the factory with wide, hopeful eyes. He carries a battered, but beloved, bucket in one hand. Above the factory, floating amidst fluffy, pastel-colored clouds, is a giant quill pen writing in the air. The ink from the pen forms the shape of fantastical creatures and swirling chocolate rivers. The color palette is dominated by warm browns, golds, and pastel blues and pinks, evoking a sense of wonder and nostalgia. The style should be realistic, but with a touch of fairytale charm. The overall composition focuses on the chocolate bar and factory as the central element, with the boy and quill pen adding context and narrative.
