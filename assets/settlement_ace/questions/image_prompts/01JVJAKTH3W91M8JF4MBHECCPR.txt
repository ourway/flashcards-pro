A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style (not cartoonish), depicting the Speaker of the House of Commons in full ceremonial regalia. The Speaker, an individual of distinguished appearance, stands centrally positioned within the frame. He is wearing a traditional black robe heavily adorned with gold embroidery, particularly around the collar and sleeves. A jabot (lace neckpiece) is visible at the neck, and he wears a full-bottomed wig, powdered white. He holds a symbolic mace, also richly decorated with gold, resting upright on its base. The background is a grand, stylized representation of the Palace of Westminster's interior, focusing on the ornate details of the architecture, such as the gothic arches and stained-glass windows, rendered in soft, pastel colors (primarily blues, creams, and golds). The light should be soft and diffused, illuminating the Speaker and highlighting the textures of the robe and the details of the mace. The overall composition should convey a sense of solemnity, authority, and tradition, visually emphasizing the Speaker's role as the representative figurehead of Parliament at significant ceremonial events. The color palette should subtly incorporate the colors of the UK flag.
