A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic maritime paintings. The scene depicts the bridge of a majestic, old-fashioned sailing ship, bathed in soft, pastel-toned light. At the helm stands a figure representing a government minister, dressed in a smart navy blue suit with subtle pinstripes, their posture conveying authority and direction. The minister is gazing forward, hand firmly on the ship's wheel, looking towards the horizon. Around them, several figures representing civil servants are diligently working, attending to various tasks on the bridge; one is charting a course, another is adjusting sails using ropes, and a third is monitoring instruments. The ship is sailing on calm, pastel-blue waters under a clear, pastel-pink sky. The overall color palette should lean towards the colors of the UK flag â€“ primarily blues, reds, and whites, but in softened, pastel shades. The ship itself should be predominantly white with navy blue and red accents. The composition should emphasize the hierarchy, with the minister in a prominent position and the civil servants actively supporting their direction. The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, to convey a sense of responsibility and professionalism. The horizon in the background should be slightly blurred, creating a sense of depth and forward movement.
