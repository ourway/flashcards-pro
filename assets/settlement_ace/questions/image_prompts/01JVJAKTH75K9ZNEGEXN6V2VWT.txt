A heartwarming, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a serene Scottish landscape under a pastel blue sky. Rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep stretch towards distant, mist-shrouded mountains. In the foreground, a group of diverse children, aged approximately 8-14, are seated in a semi-circle around a mature, kind-faced woman. The woman is dressed in a tweed jacket, suggesting a sense of authority and warmth. The children are engaged in a calm and respectful discussion, their body language open and receptive. A gentle, golden light bathes the scene, creating an atmosphere of safety and understanding. Subtle details, such as a thistle (the national flower of Scotland) subtly incorporated into the foreground foliage, and a traditional Scottish stone cottage nestled in the hills, add cultural context. The overall composition emphasizes a sense of community, care, and the importance of listening to young people. The color palette leans towards soft blues, greens, and creams, evoking a sense of tranquility and nurturing. The image should convey the idea of a supportive and understanding system focused on the well-being of children.
