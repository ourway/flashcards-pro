A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The color palette leans towards soft pastels, accented with subtle reds and blues reminiscent of the UK flag. The central focus is a split composition. On the left, a contemplative figure in Renaissance attire, resembling Shakespeare's Hamlet, stands on a stylized stage. He gazes intensely at a human skull resting on a velvet cushion, bathed in a single spotlight from above. His pose is pensive, with one hand raised in a gesture of questioning. The backdrop is a dark, textured curtain, creating a dramatic contrast. On the right side, a vibrant and idyllic scene unfolds. Lush, green foliage bursts forth, showcasing delicate May blossoms in full bloom. Sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the ground. A gentle breeze appears to be rustling the petals. Butterflies with intricately patterned wings flutter around the blossoms. A winding, cobblestone path leads into the distance, suggesting a sense of tranquility and renewal. The overall composition should evoke a sense of timelessness and the duality of human experience â€“ contemplation and beauty. The style should be realistic yet artistic, capturing the essence of Shakespearean drama and pastoral imagery.
