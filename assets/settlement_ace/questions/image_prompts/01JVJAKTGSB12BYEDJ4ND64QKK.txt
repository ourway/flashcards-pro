A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, set against a soft, pastel blue background (reminiscent of the UK flag). The central focus is a stylized, vintage-looking ballot box, painted in shades of red and white, with a prominent, ornate keyhole. A hand, rendered in a warm skin tone, is depicted inserting a stylized "ticket" into the ballot box’s keyhole. The "ticket" is designed to resemble an old-fashioned train ticket, complete with delicate perforations and a faded, handwritten inscription that reads “Electoral Register.” The hand is slightly blurred to give a sense of movement. The background is subtly decorated with faint, almost ethereal images of iconic UK landmarks like the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben. The overall composition should evoke a sense of historical importance and civic duty. Soft lighting should emanate from within the ballot box, casting a gentle glow on the scene, making the keyhole and the ticket the brightest parts of the image. The pastel colour palette will give a sense of calm and importance. The ticket should be in beige and brown colours, resembling old paper. No text should be visible in the image itself, only the visual representation of the concept.
