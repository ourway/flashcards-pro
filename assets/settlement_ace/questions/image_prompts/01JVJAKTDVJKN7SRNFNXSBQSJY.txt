A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a scene representing the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679. The artwork should be in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a brightly lit, ornate, antique birdcage with its door swung wide open. A vibrant robin, a bird commonly associated with Britain, is depicted joyfully escaping the cage and soaring upwards towards a radiant, cloud-strewn sky. The bars of the cage are subtly engraved with faint, stylized depictions of chains, now broken. Below the cage, resting on a weathered stone pedestal, is a rolled-up parchment tied with a red ribbon, symbolizing the Habeas Corpus Act itself. The color palette leans heavily on pastel shades of blue, red, and white, mirroring the colors of the UK flag while maintaining a soft, educational tone. The background features a rolling green English countryside under the expansive sky. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of liberation, justice, and the protection of individual freedoms. The style should emulate classic historical illustrations, focusing on accurate details and a light, airy feel, avoiding any harsh lines or overly modern techniques. The robin should be the focal point, symbolizing freedom gained.
