A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a split scene representing Scotland and Northern Ireland, both celebrating their patron saints' days with official holidays. The color palette should evoke a sense of national pride with pastel blues, reds, and whites reminiscent of the UK flag. On the left side, representing Scotland, picture a festive scene with bagpipes playing, people wearing kilts, and the Scottish flag (St. Andrew's Cross) subtly incorporated into the background as bunting. Thistles, the national flower, are prominently displayed. On the right side, representing Northern Ireland, showcase a lively celebration with traditional Irish music, people wearing shamrocks, and the St. Patrick's Saltire subtly integrated. Rolling green hills and a distant view of a historic castle are visible in the background. The overall composition should convey a sense of joy, cultural heritage, and shared national holiday spirit across both regions. The illustration should emphasize the "Truth" of the statement through a harmonious and unified depiction of the celebrations. The scene should avoid any modern elements or text.
