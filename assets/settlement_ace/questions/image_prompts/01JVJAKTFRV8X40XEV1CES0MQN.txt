A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a pastel color palette, depicting a stylized map of Western Europe in 1957. Six distinct countries are highlighted with soft, graduated hues of pastel blue, pink, and cream: France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Each country is represented by a symbolic landmark rendered in a delicate, detailed style, such as the Eiffel Tower for France, Brandenburg Gate for Germany, Colosseum for Italy, Atomium for Belgium, Windmill for the Netherlands, and Adolphe Bridge for Luxembourg. The rest of Europe is in muted grey tones, creating a strong contrast. Connecting these six countries are interwoven strands of wheat and gears, symbolizing agriculture and industry, respectively, rendered in light golden and silver tones. These strands merge into a central, stylized emblem resembling a blooming flower with six petals, positioned in the heart of Europe. The flower is not a literal representation of a flag, but uses the colors of the UK flag, with the petals being red, white, and blue. The background should be a subtly textured, light cream color, reminiscent of aged parchment, giving the image a historical and unified feel. The overall composition should emphasize unity, cooperation, and the geographical proximity of the six nations. The artwork should evoke a sense of optimism and the dawn of a new era of economic collaboration.
