A watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the British monarch, King Charles III, seated on the throne in the House of Lords. The King is wearing the Imperial State Crown and royal robes of crimson and gold. The throne is intricately detailed, featuring the royal coat of arms. The House of Lords is filled with peers dressed in traditional red robes, seated on red benches, facing the throne. Light streams in through the tall, arched windows, illuminating the scene. A sense of historical grandeur and solemnity should permeate the image. Pastel colors, mainly blues, reds and whites should be used to evoke the UK flag and create a regal yet inviting atmosphere. The composition should be centered around the monarch on the throne, emphasizing the King's role in inaugurating the new parliamentary session. The overall feeling should be one of respect for tradition and the importance of the monarchy in the UK's parliamentary system.
