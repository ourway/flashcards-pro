A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a serene Scottish landscape. The foreground features a lush, green golf course, meticulously rendered with individual blades of grass. Dominating the center of the image is Saint Andrew, depicted as a kindly, older gentleman with a flowing white beard, dressed in traditional Scottish attire: a kilt in a muted tartan pattern (primarily blues, greens, and reds), a cream-colored wool sweater, and sturdy brown brogues. He is in the middle of a golf swing, his gaze focused intently on the golf ball resting on a tee. The golf club is a classic wooden driver. Behind Saint Andrew, a picturesque Scottish Highlands scene unfolds. Rolling hills covered in heather in full bloom (purples and pinks) rise in the distance. A loch shimmers in the mid-ground, reflecting the soft, pastel-colored sky above (primarily blues, pinks, and whites, reminiscent of a sunrise). A few Highland cows graze peacefully on the hillside. In the upper-left corner, a subtle Saltire (the Scottish flag) is subtly incorporated into the cloud formations. The overall color palette should be soft and muted, with a focus on pastel shades and colors resembling the UK flag, creating a peaceful and memorable image. The image should be framed in a 16:9 ratio, with the main subject and idea centered.
