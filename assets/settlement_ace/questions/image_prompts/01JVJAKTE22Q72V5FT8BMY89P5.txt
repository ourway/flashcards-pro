A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the iconic Big Ben clock tower in London. The color palette should predominantly feature pastel blues, soft reds, and creams, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag. The tower should appear bathed in a gentle, warm light, suggesting a late afternoon sun. Around the base of Big Ben, illustrate a scene evoking 150 years of British history: a Victorian-era gentleman reading a newspaper, a suffragette marching for women's rights, and a modern-day tourist taking a photograph with a smartphone. These figures should be subtly integrated, not overwhelming the central image of Big Ben. The clock face should be clear and prominent, with the hands artistically blurred to suggest the passage of time. The surrounding architecture should be rendered with precision, showcasing the gothic details of the Houses of Parliament. The sky should be a soft, watercolor wash of blues and pinks, with a few wispy clouds. The overall composition should be balanced, with Big Ben centrally positioned and the historical vignettes arranged around its base, creating a visual narrative of the clock tower's 150-year history, without the use of any text.
