A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image in a realistic style, depicting a group of ten diverse individuals standing shoulder-to-shoulder in a verdant British garden. The garden is subtly arranged to mimic the shape of the Union Jack flag, with red roses, white daisies, and bluebells forming the iconic pattern. Nine of the individuals are fair-skinned, dressed in contemporary British clothing, and are holding small, potted native UK plants. The tenth individual, positioned slightly forward, is of mixed ethnicity, wearing a vibrant, patterned scarf that hints at their international heritage. They are holding a single, slightly larger potted plant that represents their parent's or grandparent's birthplace. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, with gentle blues, pinks, and greens dominating the scene, punctuated by the bold red of the roses. The background features a blurred, impressionistic rendering of a quintessential British countryside, complete with rolling hills and a distant, hazy sky. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, emphasizing the integration and diversity within the UK population while visually highlighting the "one in ten" concept.
