A hand-drawn, realistic 2D illustration in a watercolor style, depicting a grand, ornate royal scepter resting gently on top of a ballot box overflowing with voting papers. The scepter is predominantly gold, with subtle inlays of ruby and sapphire to subtly evoke the colors of the UK flag. The ballot box is a classic wooden design, with a visible slot for depositing votes. Emerging from the ballot box, like plants growing towards the sunlight, are stylized stalks of wheat, representing the prosperity and growth that a democratically elected government aims to cultivate. The background features a soft, pastel blue sky with fluffy white clouds, suggesting peace and stability. A gentle light source illuminates the scepter, emphasizing its ceremonial importance, while the ballot box and wheat stalks are equally well-lit, symbolizing the balance of power between the monarchy and the elected government. The composition should be centered, with the scepter and ballot box as the primary focal points. The overall feel is one of respectful tradition harmonizing with democratic values.
