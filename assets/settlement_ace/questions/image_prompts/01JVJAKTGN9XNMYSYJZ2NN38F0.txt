A whimsical, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a quintessential British springtime scene, ratio 16:9. The focal point is a lush, green meadow bathed in the gentle light of a pastel-colored dawn. Several fluffy, white Easter bunnies with pastel-colored ribbons around their necks are joyfully hopping amidst a vibrant display of spring flowers. Predominantly featured are daffodils and crocuses in full bloom, their yellow and purple hues echoing the pastel color palette. In the background, rolling hills reminiscent of the English countryside are visible, dotted with blossoming cherry trees. The sky transitions from a pale pink at the horizon to a soft, robin's-egg blue overhead. Subtle details, such as dew drops clinging to the flower petals and the bunnies' twitching noses, add to the realism and charm. The overall composition should evoke a sense of renewal, joy, and the arrival of spring, strongly associating Easter with the months of March and April. The colors should be predominantly pastel blues, pinks, yellows, and greens, creating a gentle and memorable visual. The artistic style should resemble classic children's book illustrations, making it engaging and easy to remember.
