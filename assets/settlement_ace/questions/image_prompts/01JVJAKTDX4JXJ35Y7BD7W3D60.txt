A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a scene related to the Suffragettes and their fight for women's suffrage. The artwork should be in a 16:9 landscape format with pastel colours. The central focus is a group of determined women, dressed in early 20th-century attire, marching resolutely down a London street. They carry banners, designed to be symbolic, with no actual text displayed. The banners feature imagery related to women's rights, such as scales of justice balanced equally, doves representing peace and equality, and stylized sunrises symbolizing a new dawn. One banner is torn, suggesting the hardships faced. The women's faces should reflect a range of emotions: determination, hope, and resilience. Some wear sashes in the suffragette colours of purple, white, and green, subtly incorporated into their clothing. The background should feature iconic London architecture, such as a suggestion of the Houses of Parliament or a traditional London street with Victorian buildings. The overall mood is one of determined optimism amidst adversity. The sky should be a soft, pastel blue with hints of white clouds, suggesting a hopeful future. The composition should emphasize the unity and strength of the women, with their figures closely grouped together. The colours, predominantly pastel variations of purple, white, and green, should evoke a sense of history and purpose. The style should be reminiscent of classic watercolor illustrations, with soft washes and delicate details, avoiding any harsh lines or overly modern aesthetics.
