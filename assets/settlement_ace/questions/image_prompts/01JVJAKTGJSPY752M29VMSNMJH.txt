A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style. The scene depicts a serene, sun-dappled orchard in the English countryside, bathed in a soft, pastel color palette dominated by blues, reds, and whites reminiscent of the UK flag. In the center, a venerable apple tree, its branches laden with ripe, red apples, stands prominently. A single, perfectly formed apple is depicted mid-fall, detached from the branch and descending towards the ground. Beneath the tree, seated on a grassy knoll, is a figure representing Isaac Newton. He is portrayed as a thoughtful, middle-aged man with powdered hair, dressed in period attire of a deep blue waistcoat and white cravat. His gaze is fixed intently on the falling apple, his expression a mixture of curiosity and profound contemplation. Around him, scattered on the grass, are various scientific instruments and papers filled with mathematical equations and diagrams. The background features rolling green hills, dotted with quaint cottages and grazing sheep, fading into a soft, hazy horizon. The overall composition emphasizes the central action of the apple falling, visually linking Newton's thoughtful observation to the concept of gravity. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of tranquility and intellectual discovery, highlighting the pivotal moment of insight.
