A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, 16:9 aspect ratio. The scene depicts a quaint, old-fashioned British sweet shop with a striped awning in pastel red and white. The shop window displays colorful jars of sweets. Inside, a young child, appearing to be around 10 years old, stands at the counter, reaching up with a handful of coins. The shopkeeper, an elderly woman with a kind face and wearing a floral dress, is gently shaking her head and holding up a hand in a "stop" gesture. Behind the child, partially visible on a shelf, are packs of cigarettes, deliberately blurred and desaturated to appear less appealing. A faint, ghostly image of a wilting flower is superimposed near the cigarettes, symbolizing the negative health effects. The color palette should be mostly pastel, with subtle uses of red, white, and blue, reminiscent of the UK flag, to subtly reinforce the British context. The overall atmosphere is warm and inviting, but the shopkeeper's gesture and the visual cues around the cigarettes subtly convey the message that the sale is prohibited, emphasizing the "False" answer to the question. The focus should be on the interaction between the child and the shopkeeper, with the blurred cigarettes serving as a secondary element. The art style should evoke a sense of nostalgia and traditional British life.
