A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a pastel color palette (primarily light blues, soft reds, and creams) depicting a grand, slightly worn, Victorian-era courtroom scene with an allegorical representation of the British government on trial. The government is symbolized by a majestic, slightly tarnished, golden lion, sitting regally on a simple wooden chair within the defendant's box. The lion appears weary, with subtly drooping posture, suggesting vulnerability. In the foreground, two figures representing the opposition party stand at the prosecutor's table. They are depicted as astute, intelligent foxes wearing spectacles and distinguished legal robes. One fox holds a magnifying glass, meticulously examining a cracked and faded scroll representing government policies. The other fox points accusingly toward a visible but small tear in the lion's mane, which subtly symbolizes a "weakness". Scattered around the courtroom floor are a few broken scales of justice, rendered in a light, aged bronze, further hinting at "failures." The courtroom is filled with onlookers, their faces blurred and indistinct, emphasizing the public scrutiny. Sunlight streams through a high, arched window, illuminating the scene with a soft, muted glow, highlighting the contrast between the lion's fading grandeur and the foxes' sharp focus on its flaws. The overall composition should guide the viewer's eye towards the lion and the foxes, emphasizing the dynamic of scrutiny and accountability.
