A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) in London, bathed in the soft, diffused light of a cloudy British day. The color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, pink, and cream, evoking a sense of historical serenity. Focus on the architectural details of the tower, emphasizing its grandeur and intricate stonework. To the left of the tower, subtly incorporate a faint, spectral Roman numeral "II" (two) crafted from swirling mist or vapor, almost hidden within the clouds, symbolizing Queen Elizabeth II. To the right of the tower, create a similar, but distinct, visual representation of the Roman numeral "I" (one), but this time depict it as crumbling stone or fading parchment, hinting at a distant, less prominent historical connection. Position both Roman numerals so that they are visible but not overwhelming, creating a visual comparison that subtly reinforces the difference between Queen Elizabeth I and Queen Elizabeth II. The overall composition should be balanced, with the Elizabeth Tower as the central, dominant subject, and the Roman numerals serving as supporting mnemonic devices.
