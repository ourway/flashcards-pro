A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting an Iron Age hill fort in ancient Britain (16:9 ratio). The scene is set atop a rolling, grassy hill, its peak crowned by a circular earthwork enclosure, representing the fort. The earthwork is constructed from layered soil and stone, weathered by time and elements. Within the enclosure, several wattle-and-daub roundhouses are visible, their conical thatched roofs blending with the natural surroundings. Figures dressed in simple, earthy-toned Iron Age clothing are shown engaged in daily activities: tending livestock (sheep and goats), crafting tools, and standing guard along the ramparts. The landscape extends outwards from the hill fort, showcasing a patchwork of fields, forests, and distant, misty mountains, all rendered in soft pastel colors (primarily blues, greens, and browns). The sky is overcast, casting a gentle, diffused light across the scene, emphasizing the historical setting and the defensive nature of the hill fort. The overall composition should convey a sense of history, resilience, and the strategic importance of these elevated settlements. The colors should evoke a sense of the British landscape while maintaining a muted, educational tone.
