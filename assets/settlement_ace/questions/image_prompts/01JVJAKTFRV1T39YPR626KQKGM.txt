A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style (16:9 ratio). The image depicts two grand buildings, subtly representing the Houses of Parliament. On the left, a stately, ornate building symbolizing the House of Lords is depicted with an ethereal, slightly faded quality. Its doors are closed, and its windows are dark, giving off a sense of being inactive. The color palette leans towards muted greys and blues, with hints of faded gold. On the right, a more vibrant and active building represents the House of Commons. The structure appears solid and grounded, bathed in a warm, inviting light. The doors are open, and figures are visible inside, suggesting activity and engagement. The color palette here is more saturated, with reds, greens, and blues, echoing the colors of the UK flag, but in a pastel tone. A symbolic beam of light emanates from the House of Commons, subtly illuminating a simple, sturdy wooden gavel resting on a pedestal in the immediate foreground, centered between the two buildings. The pedestal is draped with a cloth bearing a subtle, stylized representation of the scales of justice, slightly tilting towards the side of the House of Commons. The background fades into a soft, watercolor wash of the UK flag colours, red, white, and blue. The overall impression should be one of contrasting power dynamics, highlighting the active and influential nature of the House of Commons compared to the more ceremonial House of Lords.
