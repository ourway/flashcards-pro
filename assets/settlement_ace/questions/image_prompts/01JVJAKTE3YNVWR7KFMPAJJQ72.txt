A hand-drawn, watercolour style image depicting a group of diverse young adults (16-17 years old) participating in a community service project. The scene is set in a vibrant, slightly overgrown community garden within an urban environment, with terraced houses visible in the background. The main focus is a central group of three young people: one is carefully planting seedlings in a raised garden bed, another is painting a colorful mural on a previously drab wall, and the third is assisting an elderly woman with weeding. The mural depicts a stylized tree with roots reaching deep into the earth, and branches extending towards a bright, pastel-coloured sky filled with fluffy clouds. The planting scene uses pastel greens and browns to depict the soil and new plants. The clothing of the young people is casual and modern, and the elderly woman wears a cardigan and holds a trowel. Overlapping this scene, but slightly faded and transparent, is a faint silhouette of military equipment (tanks, fighter jets) to emphasize the contrast between military action and community service. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel blues, greens, and earthy browns, with pops of brighter colours in the mural and clothing, creating a peaceful and optimistic atmosphere. The sky is a soft, graduated blue with white clouds. The composition should be balanced and harmonious, with the community garden as the central focus, and the faint military silhouettes providing a subtle counterpoint, all within a 16:9 landscape ratio.
