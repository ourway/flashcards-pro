A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour-style image, ratio 16:9, depicting a verdant, rolling landscape under a pastel blue sky. The composition focuses on three distinct, yet interconnected, landmasses representing England, Scotland, and Wales. Each landmass is rendered with subtle visual cues hinting at their respective identities: gentle, green hills for England; rugged, mountainous terrain with heather for Scotland; and a blend of coastal cliffs and valleys for Wales. These three landmasses are arranged closely together, almost touching, symbolizing their union as Great Britain. To the far west, separated by a narrow, stylized body of water, a fourth landmass, representing Northern Ireland, is noticeably detached from the main group. This fourth landmass is rendered in a slightly muted tone, suggesting its distinct status. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues and the colours of the UK flag, with soft blues, greens, and reds predominating. The art style should be realistic but with a gentle, educational feel, avoiding harsh lines or overly detailed textures. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a sense of tranquility and unity among the three connected landmasses, while the separate landmass remains visibly distinct but not excluded.
