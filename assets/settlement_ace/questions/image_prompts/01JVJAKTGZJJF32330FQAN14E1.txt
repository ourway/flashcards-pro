A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic architectural renderings. The artwork should focus on the iconic facade of 10 Downing Street, London. The central focus is the black door with the prominent white number "10" clearly displayed. The door should feature polished brass hardware, including a doorknob and letterbox. The building's brickwork should be realistically rendered with subtle variations in color and texture, using a pastel colour palette of beige, light grey and pastel yellow. Flanking the door are symmetrical Georgian-style windows with delicate white frames and subtly reflective glass. Potted plants with vibrant green foliage should adorn either side of the entrance, adding a touch of life and color. Above the door, a subtle but elegant British flag should be draped. The sky should be overcast with soft, diffused light, typical of London weather. The overall composition should convey a sense of history, stability, and understated elegance. Avoid any cartoonish or abstract elements, maintaining a realistic and respectful portrayal of this important British landmark. The 16:9 ratio should emphasize the horizontal expanse of the building's facade, ensuring the main subject is centered and easily recognizable.
