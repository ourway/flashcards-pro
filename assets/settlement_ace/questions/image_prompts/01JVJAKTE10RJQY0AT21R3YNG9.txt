A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style landscape depicting Stonehenge at dawn in Wiltshire. The color palette should be pastel, incorporating soft blues, pinks, and creams, subtly alluding to the UK flag. The composition should centre on Stonehenge, with the monolithic stones bathed in the warm, golden light of the rising sun. The surrounding Wiltshire landscape is rendered with careful detail, showcasing rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep. A winding, narrow country lane leads towards Stonehenge, suggesting accessibility and integration within the local environment. The sky transitions from a dark indigo at the horizon to a lighter, pastel blue overhead. In the foreground, depict a small cluster of wildflowers, including poppies and cornflowers, adding a touch of vibrancy and natural beauty. The overall art style should be realistic, yet with a gentle, painterly quality that evokes a sense of tranquility and historical significance. The stones themselves should show their age and weathering, with subtle variations in color and texture. The horizon line should be low, emphasizing the vastness of the Wiltshire landscape and the monumentality of Stonehenge.
