A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of a vintage travel poster, showcasing symbolic representations of Germany, Lithuania, Romania, and the UK. The composition should be centered and balanced within the 16:9 landscape format. In the foreground, depict four iconic landmarks, each subtly colored in muted pastel tones, transitioning smoothly into one another. First, the Brandenburg Gate (Germany), then the Hill of Crosses (Lithuania), followed by the painted monasteries of Bucovina (Romania), and finally, the Tower Bridge (UK). These landmarks are not isolated but flow together seamlessly, suggesting unity and interconnectedness. A soft, diffused light bathes the scene, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. Above the landmarks, a flock of doves, each bearing a small, stylized olive branch, soars across a sky painted with gentle hues of blue, white, and pale red, echoing the colors of the UK flag. The overall mood should be one of peace, collaboration, and historical significance, avoiding any harsh lines or overly bright colours to maintain a sophisticated, educational aesthetic. The artwork should evoke a sense of nostalgia and timelessness.
