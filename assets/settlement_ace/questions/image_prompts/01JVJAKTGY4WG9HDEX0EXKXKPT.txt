A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the Houses of Parliament with a distinct separation between the House of Lords and the main government building. The House of Lords building should be positioned slightly further away from the main government building to emphasize its independence. The architecture of the House of Lords should be grand and imposing, yet subtly distinct in style from the main government building to highlight its unique role. A symbolic, ornate bridge, rendered in pastel blue, arches gracefully between the two buildings but does not directly connect, suggesting a formal connection but also a maintained distance. A group of traditionally dressed Lords, wearing red robes, is depicted on the House of Lords side. On the government building side, ministers are depicted in more modern attire. The sky above is a soft, pastel blue, reminiscent of a clear morning in London. The overall color palette leans towards the pastel variations of the UK flag's colors: soft blues, reds, and whites. The composition is centered to maintain focus on the relationship between the two buildings, with the bridge acting as a central visual element. The foreground could feature a meticulously rendered, traditional British garden, adding depth and cultural context.
