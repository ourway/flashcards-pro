A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a partially obscured television set. The scene is bathed in a soft, diffused light, creating a gentle and empathetic atmosphere. The television screen shows a vibrant, colorful scene of a British garden in full bloom, with roses, lavender, and daffodils prominent. This vibrant scene is only partially visible, as a large, stylized hand, rendered in soft pastel blue, gently covers the top half of the screen. The hand is not blocking the scene entirely but rather symbolizes a partial obstruction of view. The color palette should be primarily pastel blues, pinks, and yellows, with the greens of the garden being muted and calming. The lower portion of the screen remains fully visible, displaying the lower half of the garden scene, symbolizing the remaining benefit. The style should evoke a sense of compassion and accessibility, avoiding any harsh lines or overly bright colors. The composition should be centered, with the television set as the focal point and the hand as a secondary, symbolic element. The background should be a simple, blurred representation of a cozy living room, suggesting a domestic setting. The overall impression should be one of gentle support and understanding, visually representing the concept of a partial discount or benefit.
