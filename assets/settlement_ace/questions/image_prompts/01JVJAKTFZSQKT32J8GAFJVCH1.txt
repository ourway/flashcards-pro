A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, focusing on the English Civil War. The composition should be centered, adhering to a 16:9 landscape ratio. The primary subject is a regal Cavalier, depicted as a noble knight, mounted on a majestic, white steed. He wears polished silver armor, reflecting the sunlight, and a flowing, crimson cape emblazoned with a stylized royal crest in gold thread. His helmet is adorned with a plume of white feathers, gently swaying in the wind. The horse is caparisoned with royal blue fabric, also featuring the golden crest. The Cavalier holds a long, gleaming lance, pointed slightly upwards, symbolizing loyalty and readiness. Behind the Cavalier, a subtle backdrop of rolling, green English countryside fades into the distance, with a hint of a medieval castle on a distant hill. The sky is a soft, pastel blue, with gentle, watercolor-style clouds. The color palette should lean towards the colors of the UK flag (red, white, and blue) with pastel variations to create a noble and historical atmosphere. The overall impression should evoke a sense of chivalry, loyalty, and the historical context of the English Civil War, creating a visual mnemonic associating the Cavaliers with their support for King Charles I.
