A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, with a 16:9 landscape ratio. The central focus is on a stylized, symbolic representation of the American colonies declaring independence. Imagine a parchment document, unfurled in the center, its edges slightly frayed with age. Upon it, instead of text, are thirteen interconnected stars, each subtly different in size and brightness, symbolizing the original thirteen colonies. The stars are arranged in a gentle arc, suggesting unity and a rising nation. Behind the parchment, a burst of fireworks explodes in a vibrant display of red, white, and blue â€“ colors reminiscent of both the American and British flags, hinting at the historical connection and subsequent separation. The fireworks are not photorealistic but rather artistic interpretations, with trails of light that subtly form the shape of iconic American symbols like eagles and liberty bells. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, creating a sense of historical distance and solemnity, while the fireworks provide a dynamic contrast. The background is a soft, hazy blue, suggesting the vastness of the Atlantic Ocean and the distance between the colonies and Great Britain. The composition is balanced, drawing the eye to the interconnected stars on the parchment, emphasizing the theme of independence and the birth of a new nation. There should be no text or numbers in the image.
