A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, depicting a grand, classical library bathed in soft, pastel light. The library's architecture features prominent Roman-style arches and columns, subtly incorporating the colors of the UK flag (red, white, and blue) in the marble inlays. Dominating the central composition is a large, ornate table laden with books, quill pens, inkwells, and scientific instruments like a telescope and a globe. Emerging from the table is a radiant, stylized lightbulb, its glow subtly illuminating the faces of diverse historical figures seated around the table in deep contemplation. The figures are dressed in 18th-century attire, representing philosophers, scientists, and political thinkers. One figure is sketching a geometric diagram, another is writing furiously in a journal, and a third is peering through the telescope. The lightbulb doesn't cast harsh light; instead, it emanates a gentle, warm glow, symbolizing the birth of new ideas. Books on the shelves behind the figures are subtly labeled with symbolic titles alluding to politics, philosophy, and science. The overall composition should convey a sense of intellectual curiosity, discovery, and the transformative power of new ideas during the Enlightenment. The pastel color palette lends a serene and timeless quality to the scene. The image ratio is 16:9, emphasizing the horizontal expanse of the library and the collective intellectual endeavor.
