A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the White Tower of the Tower of London as a prominent example of medieval architecture. The scene is set on a slightly overcast day, casting soft shadows across the tower's aged, cream-colored stone walls. The Tower should dominate the center of the 16:9 landscape composition. The architectural details of the White Tower should be rendered with accuracy, showcasing its Norman design, including the four corner turrets, rounded arches, and small, deeply set windows. A few ravens should be shown flying around the tower. At the base of the tower, a small group of figures dressed in medieval clothing – knights in shining armor, a king with a crown, and commoners – should be subtly incorporated to hint at the historical significance of the tower. The surrounding grounds should feature elements of the Tower of London complex, such as sections of the outer walls and hints of the River Thames in the background. The color palette should primarily consist of muted pastel tones, with creams, grays, and blues dominating the scene, but with small details in the red and blue of the UK flag. The overall atmosphere should evoke a sense of history, strength, and timelessness, creating a memorable visual association with the White Tower as a key example of architecture from the Middle Ages.
