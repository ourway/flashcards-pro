A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting the triumphant return of Charles II to England in May 1660. The scene is set at the port of Dover, with a grand ship adorned with the Royal Standard of England prominently displayed. Charles II, dressed in regal attire with a flowing red cape, stands on the deck, waving to the cheering crowds. The crowd is composed of people from all walks of life, dressed in clothing styles of the 17th century. The background features the white cliffs of Dover, rendered with careful attention to geological detail, and a clear, blue sky with soft, pastel-colored clouds. Dutch ships are subtly visible on the horizon, symbolizing Charles II's departure from the Netherlands. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the Union Jack, with accents of gold on the royal regalia. The art style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, to convey the historical significance of the event. The composition should center on Charles II and the Royal Standard, ensuring they are the focal points, while the surrounding details add depth and context to the scene. The image should evoke a sense of joy, celebration, and the restoration of the monarchy.
