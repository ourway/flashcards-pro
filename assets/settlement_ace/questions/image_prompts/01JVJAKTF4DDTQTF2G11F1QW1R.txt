A hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic, watercolour style depicting a cozy living room scene in a British home. The color palette should primarily feature pastel shades of blue, red, and white, reminiscent of the UK flag. The focal point is a comfortable armchair bathed in soft, natural light streaming from a window. An elderly woman with kind eyes and gentle smile, her silver hair neatly styled, is seated in the armchair. She is engrossed in watching a classic television set. The TV screen glows warmly, showing a nature documentary featuring rolling green hills and grazing sheep, a typical British countryside scene. On a nearby table, there's a half-finished cup of tea in a delicate china cup and a plate with a single digestive biscuit. A knitted blanket in a patchwork of blue, red, and white is draped over the arm of the chair. Behind the armchair, a framed photograph on the wall shows the woman as a young girl, perhaps around 5 years old, holding hands with her parents, suggesting a long and fulfilling life. The overall atmosphere should be serene and peaceful, evoking a sense of comfort, wisdom, and the simple joys of life in older age. The absence of any visible payment reminders or bills subtly implies the exemption from the TV license fee, linking the image directly to the question's answer.
