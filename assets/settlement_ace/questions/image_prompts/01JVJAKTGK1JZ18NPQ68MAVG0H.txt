A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a balanced scale, rendered in pastel blue. On one side of the scale, depict a collection of diverse British citizens (representing the public), watercolor-painted in various skin tones and attire, subtly suggesting different backgrounds and beliefs. On the other side of the scale, render the scales as equal, balanced, and neutral. The background should consist of an abstract representation of the Houses of Parliament in soft, muted red and white hues, symbolizing the UK government. The entire image should be bathed in a soft, diffused light to emphasize the neutrality and impartiality. The art style should evoke a sense of trust, stability, and fairness, reminiscent of classic British illustrations. The composition should be symmetrical and harmonious, reinforcing the concept of balance and neutrality. The absence of text or labels is crucial; the image should convey its message purely through visual symbolism.
