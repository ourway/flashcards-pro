A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical painting. The canvas, in a 16:9 landscape ratio, features Queen Elizabeth I as the central figure, depicted in her iconic regal attire - a Tudor gown adorned with subtle floral embroidery, a delicate lace ruff, and a jeweled crown. She stands in a grand hall, inspired by Hampton Court Palace, with sunlight streaming through tall, arched windows. In her hands, she gently holds a single white rose, symbolizing peace and purity of faith. Behind her, receding into the background, are two distinct groups of figures. To her left, a group of Catholic clergy in traditional robes, their faces partially obscured in shadow, symbolizing the past. To her right, a group of common people, their faces illuminated by the sunlight, representing the Church of England and the future, their expressions hopeful and serene. The color palette primarily consists of pastel blues, soft reds, and creamy whites, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The overall composition aims to convey a sense of balance and the establishment of a middle ground, a 'protest' against religious extremism, with Queen Elizabeth I as the steady, guiding force. The absence of text ensures the image serves as a visual mnemonic, prompting recall of the Queen's Protestant faith through symbolic representation.
