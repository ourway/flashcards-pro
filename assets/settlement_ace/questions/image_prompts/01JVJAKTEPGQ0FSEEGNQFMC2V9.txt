A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting a lively summer scene in London, capturing the essence of "The Proms." The artwork, presented in a 16:9 landscape ratio, focuses on a central composition of a grand, open-air concert. A symphony orchestra, meticulously detailed with various instruments like violins, cellos, flutes, and trumpets, fills the foreground. The musicians, dressed in formal attire, are engrossed in their performance. The conductor, positioned prominently, leads with passionate gestures. Above the orchestra, musical notes in pastel shades of blue, red, and white (resembling the UK flag's colors) float and swirl, visually representing the orchestral music filling the air. Behind the orchestra, a stylized depiction of iconic London landmarks such as the Royal Albert Hall (where the Proms are held) and the London Eye is subtly integrated into the background. The entire scene is bathed in the warm, golden light of a summer evening, with stylized trees and flowers adding to the festive atmosphere. The art style should be realistic with soft edges, and the composition should evoke a sense of celebration, cultural richness, and the joy of music during the summer months. The colors should primarily be pastel, with accents of red, white, and blue to subtly represent the UK.
