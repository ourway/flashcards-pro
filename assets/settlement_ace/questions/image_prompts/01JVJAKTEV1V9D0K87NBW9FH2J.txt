A hand-drawn, 2D, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting Boudicca, the warrior queen of the Iceni tribe, leading a revolt against the Romans in ancient Britain. The color palette should primarily feature earthy tones with accents of red and blue, subtly reflecting the UK flag. Boudicca is the central figure, portrayed as a strong, determined woman with long, flowing red hair. She is wearing simple Celtic clothing with bronze jewelry, and a torc around her neck. She stands in a chariot pulled by two powerful horses, their manes flowing wildly. Her posture is upright and commanding, holding a spear in one hand and reins in the other. Her face displays a fierce expression of defiance and determination. Surrounding Boudicca and her chariot are Celtic warriors, also on horseback and on foot, raising their weapons in a battle cry. The background shows a vast, rolling landscape of ancient Britain, with a burning Roman settlement in the distance, plumes of dark smoke rising. The sky is overcast, casting a dramatic light on the scene. The overall composition should convey a sense of movement, energy, and the courage of Boudicca leading her people in a bold uprising against the Roman Empire. The image should aim to capture the historical essence of Boudicca's revolt, emphasizing her strength, leadership, and the magnitude of her rebellion against Roman rule.
