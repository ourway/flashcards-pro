A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a scene suggesting the aftermath of a historical mystery, rendered in a pastel color palette with subtle hints of red and blue to evoke the UK flag. The central focus is a regal, yet distressed, figure of Mary Stuart. She is standing in a grand, stone-walled chamber of a Scottish castle, softly illuminated by the light streaming through a tall, arched window. Her face conveys a mixture of sorrow and apprehension. Around her, faint ghostly figures of court members whisper and point, subtly implying suspicion. In the background, a partially obscured, shadowed figure lies on an ornate rug, hinting at the murder that has occurred. In the foreground, a raven with a scroll (symbolizing a message) is taking flight towards a distant, sunlit castle on the horizon, representing Elizabeth I's court. The overall composition should convey a sense of intrigue, vulnerability, and a plea for assistance. The artistic style should be reminiscent of classic historical portraiture, emphasizing detail and emotional expression, with a backdrop that subtly suggests both the grandeur and the treachery of the era.
