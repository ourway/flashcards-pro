A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D landscape image in a 16:9 ratio. The scene depicts a quaint, idealized British street, reminiscent of a northern town in the UK. The buildings are terraced houses with red brick facades and slate roofs, some adorned with window boxes overflowing with colorful flowers in pastel shades of pink, purple, and yellow. A traditional pub, "The Rovers Return," is centrally located, its sign swinging gently in the breeze, painted in hues of red, white, and blue to subtly evoke the UK flag. Cobblestone paving lines the street, adding to the historical charm. In the foreground, a classic British telephone box stands, also in the iconic red. Washed pastel colors dominate the palette, giving the scene a warm, nostalgic feel. The overall composition aims to create a sense of community and familiarity, like a postcard from a beloved, fictional place. The visual style should be realistic, detailed, and inviting, evocative of classic British illustrations, with soft lighting and gentle shadows to enhance the depth and realism. The sky should be slightly overcast, typical of the UK, with soft, diffused light filtering through. The entire scene should capture the essence of a long-running, beloved British soap opera setting.
