A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic, watercolour style, reminiscent of classic British book illustrations. The colour palette should be primarily pastel blues, reds, and whites, echoing the colours of the UK flag. The 16:9 landscape composition centers on a stately, yet approachable, Prince Philip, depicted in his later years, wearing a distinguished naval uniform adorned with subtle royal insignia. He stands not in a palace, but against the backdrop of Edinburgh Castle, perched dramatically upon its volcanic rock. The castle should be rendered with careful attention to architectural detail, showcasing its historic stone walls and iconic silhouette against a soft, watercolour sky. In the foreground, a suggestion of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo can be hinted at through subtly placed, miniature marching bagpipers, almost lost in the landscape, adding depth and a sense of Scottish cultural identity. The overall mood should be one of quiet dignity and historical significance, emphasizing Prince Philip's connection to both the monarchy and the city of Edinburgh, making it a memorable visual cue for "The Duke of Edinburgh." The image should evoke a sense of respect and tradition, avoiding any overly dramatic or sensational elements.
