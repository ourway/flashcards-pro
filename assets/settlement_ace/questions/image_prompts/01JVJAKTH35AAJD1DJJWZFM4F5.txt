A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a majestic, yet approachable, British Lion wearing a stylized, ornate crown. The crown is slightly tilted, as if playfully askew, subtly conveying the idea of limited power. Behind the lion, partially obscured but clearly visible, is a large, bound book representing the Constitution. The book's cover is a deep, royal blue with gold embossed detailing reminiscent of historical legal documents. A soft, warm light emanates from the book, illuminating the lion. In the foreground, scattered symbolic items are shown: a quill pen resting on parchment, a set of scales representing justice, and a laurel wreath. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel blues, reds, and whites, evoking the colors of the Union Jack, but in a softer, more academic tone. The lion is rendered with realistic fur texture and a gentle expression, avoiding any aggressive or overly imposing depiction. The overall composition should feel balanced and harmonious, conveying the idea of tradition, law, and the delicate balance of power within a constitutional monarchy. The background should be a soft, blended wash of pastel colors, suggesting the rolling hills of the British countryside, but remaining unobtrusive to the central subjects.
