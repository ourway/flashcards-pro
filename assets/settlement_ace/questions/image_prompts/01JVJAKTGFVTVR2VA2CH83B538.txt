A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is King Henry VIII, depicted in his iconic Tudor attire â€“ a richly embroidered crimson doublet with gold accents, a large jeweled necklace, and a regal fur-trimmed cloak. He stands resolutely in the center of a split scene. To his left (viewer's left), is a grand, ornate, yet somber depiction of the Vatican, with subtle grey and blue tones dominating the architecture. A single, closed wooden door is visible, symbolically representing the Pope's denial. To Henry's right (viewer's right), a vibrant, emerging scene depicts the early foundations of a distinctly English church. This side uses a warmer pastel palette of creams, golds, and very light blues. The church is not fully formed, suggesting its nascent state. A beam of light shines down on the English church side, illuminating Henry's determined face. His expression is a complex mix of resolve and a hint of defiance. The background should feature a subtle, rolling English countryside landscape on the right side, contrasting with the stark Italian architecture on the left. The overall composition should convey a clear division and a sense of historical turning point, with Henry VIII as the pivotal figure. The colour palette should subtly echo the colours of the UK flag (red, white, and blue) within the clothing and architectural details, maintaining a soft, educational tone.
