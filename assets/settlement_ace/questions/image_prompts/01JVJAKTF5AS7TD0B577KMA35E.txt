A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting two connected scenes within a 16:9 landscape format. The left side of the image showcases a bright, airy doctor's office or hospital setting. A friendly doctor with a stethoscope around their neck is interacting with a child patient, symbolizing health. Subtle details include medical charts on the wall, a window letting in natural light, and pastel blue and white color scheme to emphasize cleanliness and care. The right side of the image transitions seamlessly into a classroom setting. Children are seated at desks, engaged in learning, with a teacher at the front of the class. The classroom is filled with educational materials such as books, maps, and artwork. The overall color scheme is a mix of pastel yellow and green to represent growth and knowledge. A connecting element, such as a stylized representation of a DNA strand or a brain, bridges the two scenes in the center of the image, visually linking "Health" and "Education" as interconnected aspects of societal well-being. The artistic style should emphasize realism and approachability, avoiding cartoonish elements. The color palette should subtly incorporate colors reminiscent of the UK flag (red, white, and blue) to reinforce the context. The composition should be balanced, ensuring neither scene overpowers the other, and the central connecting element should draw the eye.
