A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Welsh Assembly. The scene unfolds within a grand, stylized version of the Senedd building, bathed in soft, pastel hues reminiscent of a dawn sky over the Welsh countryside. Dominating the composition are stylized, interconnected Celtic knots, arranged to visually suggest the number '60'. These knots are rendered in shades of deep red, echoing the color of the Welsh dragon, and are interwoven with delicate, pastel-blue ribbons, symbolizing unity and collaboration. Sixty miniature, stylized figures, representing the elected members, are subtly integrated within the knotwork, each figure appearing unique and engaged in thoughtful discussion. Each member is dressed in neutral clothing, to represent equality.The background features a gentle wash of greens and browns, evoking the rolling hills and valleys of Wales, with a faint outline of Snowdonia in the distance. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, with a clear focal point on the interconnected Celtic knots, ensuring the image serves as a memorable visual mnemonic for the number '60' and its association with the Welsh Assembly. The style is realistic yet softened by the watercolor medium, creating an approachable and educational visual. The image avoids any text, focusing solely on visual cues to convey the information.
