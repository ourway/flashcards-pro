A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a pastel color palette (primarily pastel blues, reds, and whites) depicting a celebratory scene outside the Houses of Parliament in London. The scene is set in 1928. In the center, a diverse group of women and men, all dressed in 1920s attire, are joyfully raising their hands in unison. Some are holding symbolic banners, now without text, only with symbolic images of scales representing equality. A suffragette sash, colored in pastel hues, is draped across one of the women. The Houses of Parliament stand majestically in the background, its clock tower subtly indicating the passage of time and the historical significance of the moment. Soft, diffused sunlight bathes the scene, creating a sense of optimism and progress. The artistic style should evoke vintage posters from the 1920s, with clean lines and muted tones, avoiding any harshness or modern digital effects. The overall composition should emphasize unity and the hard-won victory of equal voting rights, visually symbolizing the 'True' answer to the question.
