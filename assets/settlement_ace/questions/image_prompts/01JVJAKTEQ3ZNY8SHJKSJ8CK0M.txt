A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a pastel color palette (primarily blues, reds, and creams), depicting a grand oak tree, its roots deeply embedded in the ground, symbolizing the foundational principles of law. Around the base of the tree, several figures are gathered: a king in regal attire, looking thoughtful and slightly humbled; a group of barons with quills and parchment, representing the authors of the Magna Carta; and common people, their faces showing a mix of relief and hope. Draped over the branches of the oak is a large, ornate scroll, representing the Magna Carta itself. The scroll is partially unfurled, revealing faint, illegible script. A symbolic crown, slightly askew, rests at the base of the tree, near the king's feet, signifying the limitation of royal power. Sunlight filters through the leaves, illuminating the scene with a soft, hopeful glow. The composition is centered, with the tree as the dominant element, emphasizing the central theme of law and justice applying to all, even the monarch. The overall style should evoke a sense of historical importance and enduring principles.
