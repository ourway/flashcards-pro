A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image depicting a cross-section of a Union Jack themed pie, resting on a delicate, vintage china plate with a floral pattern reminiscent of classic British tea sets. The pie chart's dominant colors are shades of red, white, and blue, mirroring the UK flag. A small, distinct segment, precisely 4% of the total pie, is colored in a rich, deep green, symbolizing growth and the flourishing Muslim community within the UK. This green slice is subtly textured with a faint, swirling pattern evocative of Islamic geometric art. The remaining 96% is divided into varying shades of red, white, and blue, creating a visually harmonious representation of the overall UK population. The china plate sits on a rustic wooden table, adding a touch of British countryside charm. Soft, diffused light illuminates the scene, casting gentle shadows that emphasize the pie's texture and the plate's delicate details. The art style should resemble a detailed watercolor painting, with soft brushstrokes and subtle color gradients, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The overall composition should be balanced and visually appealing, ensuring the 4% green segment is noticeable yet proportionate, reinforcing the correct answer without the use of any text.
