A poignant, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a medieval English village scene rendered in a pastel colour palette, predominantly blues, reds, and whites reminiscent of the UK flag. The scene is divided into three distinct sections. One section, occupying approximately one-third of the image on the left, is vibrant and full of life: villagers are engaged in daily activities – a blacksmith hammering at his forge, children playing with hoops, farmers tending to their crops. The sky above this section is bright and clear. The central and right sections, together occupying two-thirds of the image, are shrouded in a misty, desaturated grey. Buildings are dilapidated, fields are overgrown, and figures are fewer and more subdued. Some are depicted mourning, while others are ill, lying on the ground. The sky above these sections is overcast and bleak. Dominating the desaturated area is a stylized, symbolic representation of the Black Death – not a literal depiction of disease, but a subtle, swirling grey mist emanating from rats near the village, subtly hinting at the cause of the devastation. The overall composition emphasizes the stark contrast between life and loss, vividly illustrating the devastating impact of the Black Death on England's population, where one section represents the survivors, and the other two sections symbolize the loss of two-thirds of the population.
