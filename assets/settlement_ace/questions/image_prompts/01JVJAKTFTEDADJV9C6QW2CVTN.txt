A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a serene Irish countryside scene under a clear, pastel blue sky. The central focus is a vibrant green field, representing Ireland, gently sloping towards a calm, reflective river that meanders through the landscape. Along the riverbank, depict nine mature oak trees standing tall and proud, their leaves painted in varying shades of green and gold, symbolising the nine years after the end of WWII, before Ireland became a republic. In the distance, subtly incorporate the suggestion of rolling hills, their colors fading into a soft, pastel purple haze. A single, stylized, vintage-looking boat, painted in gentle pastel red and white, floats peacefully on the river, representing the journey towards independence. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades reminiscent of the UK flag, with the inclusion of soft blues, reds, and greens dominating the composition. The light source is soft and diffused, creating a sense of peace and tranquility, enhancing the historical significance of the scene. The art style should evoke a sense of nostalgia and respect for the Irish landscape and its history.
