A hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic, watercolor style, depicting a vibrant St. Patrick's Day celebration. The scene is set against a soft, pastel-blue sky reminiscent of a clear March morning in the UK. The central focus is a jovial gathering of people, mostly children, in a quaint village square with historic stone buildings in the background. The main colors should be pastel green, white, and a touch of orange. The children are dressed in traditional Irish attire, adorned with shamrocks and carrying small Irish flags. One child is playing a traditional Irish instrument, like a tin whistle or bodhr√°n. In the foreground, a close-up of a patch of lush green shamrocks, each leaf meticulously detailed. Intertwined with the shamrocks are subtle, pastel-colored Celtic knots. The overall mood is festive and joyful, capturing the essence of St. Patrick's Day. The composition should be balanced and pleasing to the eye, with the village square and the sky filling the 16:9 ratio. The image should evoke a sense of cultural heritage and celebration, subtly reminding the viewer of the Irish connection to St. Patrick and his feast day on March 17th.
