A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9, depicting a vibrant beach scene under a clear, pastel-blue sky. In the center of the image, two distinct groups of children are collaborating to build a large sandcastle. One group, dressed in red t-shirts, is carefully constructing the walls and towers. The other group, wearing blue t-shirts, is focused on adding intricate details like moats and flags. The sandcastle itself is grand and elaborate, showing clear signs of teamwork and combined effort. Buckets, shovels, and other sandcastle-building tools are scattered around the base of the castle, further emphasizing the collaborative nature of the project. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with soft blues, reds, yellows, and greens dominating the scene, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag. The sea in the background is a calm, light blue, and the sand is a warm, inviting beige. The composition focuses on the sandcastle and the two groups of children working together, symbolizing the coalition formed in the 2010 General Election. The style should be reminiscent of classic children's book illustrations, with attention to detail and a focus on creating a sense of harmony and cooperation.
