A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor scene depicting a comical tug-of-war between two distinct landscapes, set against a soft, pastel sky. On the left side of the 16:9 canvas, rolling green hills represent Wales, dotted with peacefully grazing sheep and traditional stone cottages with smoking chimneys. A proud Welsh Dragon flag flutters gently atop the highest hill. On the right side, a similar landscape represents Northern Ireland, symbolized by the Giant's Causeway basalt columns rising dramatically from the coast, topped with a plate piled high with Ulster Fry. The Ulster Fry includes fried eggs, bacon, sausages, black pudding, and soda bread, all rendered in appetizing detail. A leek, the national symbol of Wales, strains against a piece of soda bread, creating the tug-of-war scene. Pastel colours, dominated by greens and browns for the landscapes, and reds, whites, and blues subtly incorporated into the sky and flags, create a calming yet informative visual. The overall composition emphasizes the contrast between the two regions and their respective culinary identities, highlighting that Ulster Fry belongs to Northern Ireland, not Wales. The style is realistic, but with a slight whimsical touch to make it engaging and memorable.
