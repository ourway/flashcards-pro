A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a verdant Welsh valley under a clear, pastel-blue sky. In the center, a medieval stone fortress, its walls adorned with intricate Celtic knotwork designs, stands proudly. From the fortress's ramparts, a banner displaying a stylized Welsh Dragon (Y Ddraig Goch) flutters gently in the breeze. The dragon is rendered in shades of deep red and gold. The valley floor is dotted with quaint Welsh cottages, their roofs a warm, earthy brown, and smoke gently rising from their chimneys. Children are depicted playing in the foreground, some holding slates with ancient Welsh script inscribed upon them. The surrounding landscape features rolling hills, sheep grazing peacefully, and a winding river reflecting the sky. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, green, and gold, subtly echoing the colors of the Welsh flag. The composition emphasizes the fortress as a symbol of linguistic and cultural preservation, isolating it from any English influence. The entire scene is bathed in soft, natural light, giving it a serene and timeless quality.
