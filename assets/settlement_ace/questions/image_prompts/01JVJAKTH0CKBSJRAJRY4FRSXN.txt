A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic, 2D watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a cozy living room in a quintessential British home. The focal point is a vintage television set, its screen illuminated with a scene of the Houses of Parliament in session. The architectural details of the Palace of Westminster are clearly visible on the screen, with figures representing members of Parliament engaged in a lively debate. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, reminiscent of the UK flag. The living room is furnished with a comfortable armchair draped with a knitted throw, a small side table holding a cup of tea, and a traditional British bulldog asleep on a rug in the foreground. Soft, warm light emanates from a nearby lamp, casting gentle shadows and creating an inviting atmosphere. The composition should emphasize the accessibility and immediacy of parliamentary proceedings, suggesting that they are brought directly into people's homes through television broadcasts. The overall style should evoke a sense of tradition, domesticity, and the importance of civic engagement.
