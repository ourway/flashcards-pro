A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style (not cartoonish), depicting a whimsical yet informative scene. The focal point is a colossal, friendly-looking bell, personified with gentle eyes and a subtle smile, suspended within a stylized, pastel-colored representation of the Elizabeth Tower (commonly known as the Clock Tower) of the Houses of Parliament. The tower should be rendered with architectural accuracy but softened with pastel hues of blue and beige, evoking a sense of history and serenity. Emanating from the bell are gentle, radiating sound waves visualized as light, pastel-colored ribbons that reach outwards, encompassing iconic London landmarks in miniature form: a red double-decker bus, a silhouette of the London Eye, and a miniature Tower Bridge. These landmarks are bathed in the soft glow of the bell's chimes. The sky above the tower is a gradient of soft blues and pinks, suggesting a peaceful dawn or dusk. The overall composition should be centered and balanced, emphasizing the bell's benevolent presence and its role as a timekeeper for the city. The colour palette leans heavily on pastel shades of red, white, and blue, subtly referencing the UK flag without being overtly patriotic. The artwork should evoke a sense of calm, reliability, and the enduring nature of British institutions.
