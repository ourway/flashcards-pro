A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image depicting a runner, Sir Roger Bannister, mid-stride on a classic British running track. The track should be rendered in muted, earthy tones, surrounded by a verdant green field with a backdrop of the iconic spires of Oxford University, subtly hinting at his academic background. Bannister himself is portrayed in a vintage running kit – white vest and dark shorts – his face etched with determination and focus. A symbolic stopwatch, slightly blurred to convey motion, is positioned in the foreground, its hands just past the '4-minute' mark, rendered in a soft, pastel blue. Above him, a stylized laurel wreath, a symbol of victory, floats gently, interwoven with subtle red and white ribbons, echoing the colours of the Union Jack. The overall composition should evoke a sense of historical achievement and British sporting pride, with a soft, diffused lighting that adds a touch of nostalgia and timelessness to the scene. The art style is realistic, aiming for a lifelike representation of Bannister in action, avoiding cartoonish elements.
