A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting two symbolic elements representing the factors contributing to faster population growth in the UK. The composition is set against a soft, pastel blue sky, reminiscent of a clear British summer day.

In the center, a stylized, verdant tree with deep roots representing the UK is flourishing. From the left, a flock of birds, each carrying a tiny, diverse figure representing migrants, is flying towards the tree, gently landing on its branches, symbolizing migration into the UK. The birds are coloured in the pastel shades of red, white and blue.

To the right of the tree, a winding, ascending staircase made of stone, coloured in a light grey, symbolizes longer life expectancy. At the top of the staircase, an elderly couple, drawn with warmth and vitality, are gazing out at the landscape, representing the extended lifespan of the UK population. The overall color palette utilizes soft pastel shades with hints of red, white, and blue, subtly reflecting the colors of the UK flag, to promote a sense of familiarity and connection to the UK. The style is realistic to help the user easily identify what is being depicted. The image should be in 16:9 format.
