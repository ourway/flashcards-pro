A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, showcasing two iconic English food items. The composition is divided vertically. On the left, a generous slice of roast beef, richly browned with crisp edges, sits on a porcelain white plate. Next to the roast beef are perfectly roasted potatoes, glistening with fat, and vibrant green, steamed broccoli. The gravy is in a small gravy boat, ready to be poured. On the right side, a portion of golden, crispy fish and chips is presented in a traditional newspaper cone. The fish is flaky and white, with steam rising gently. The chips are thick-cut and perfectly fried, with a sprinkle of salt. A small pot of tartar sauce sits beside the chips. The background is a soft, muted pastel blue, reminiscent of a clear English sky. The overall color palette leans towards the red, white, and blue of the Union Jack, subtly integrated through the food and background. The art style aims for realism with a touch of warmth, evoking feelings of comfort and nostalgia associated with classic British cuisine. The plate of roast beef and the cone of fish and chips are centered within a 16:9 format.
