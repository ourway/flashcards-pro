A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London, under a slightly overcast sky. The Cenotaph, rendered in Portland stone, stands prominently in the center of the 16:9 landscape composition. Around the base of the Cenotaph, a collection of vibrant red poppy wreaths are laid, their colors providing a stark contrast against the pale stone and the muted greens and browns of the surrounding foliage. In the background, suggest the presence of Whitehall with soft, blurred architectural details hinting at government buildings. A solemn atmosphere should be evoked through the lighting and color palette, primarily using pastel blues, grays, and creams, with accents of red from the poppies, subtly referencing the UK flag. The overall impression should be one of quiet remembrance and respect. The image should evoke a sense of national mourning and the Cenotaph's role as a war memorial, visually connecting the monument with the concept of honoring those who served.
