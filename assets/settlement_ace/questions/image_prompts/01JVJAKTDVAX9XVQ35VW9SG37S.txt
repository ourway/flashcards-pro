A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the United Kingdom mainland. The artwork should primarily utilize a pastel color palette, with subtle hints of red, white, and blue reminiscent of the UK flag integrated into the landscape. The scene is divided into three horizontal sections. The top section features the northernmost point, John O'Groats in Scotland. Illustrate a quaint, pastel-colored village nestled along a rugged coastline, with the sea stretching out towards the horizon. The sky above should be a soft, watercolour blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The middle section should depict the vast and varied landscape of the UK, from the Scottish Highlands to the rolling hills of central England. Use varying shades of green and brown to represent the different terrains. A winding, pastel-colored road stretches from the top of the image towards the bottom, symbolizing the long journey. The bottom section showcases Land's End in southwestern England. Illustrate dramatic cliffs overlooking the turbulent sea. A lighthouse stands prominently on the edge of the cliffs, casting a beam of soft, pastel-yellow light. The overall composition should guide the viewer's eye from John O'Groats to Land's End, emphasizing the considerable distance. The art style should be realistic yet gentle, avoiding harsh lines and favouring soft, blended colours to create a sense of serenity and vastness.
