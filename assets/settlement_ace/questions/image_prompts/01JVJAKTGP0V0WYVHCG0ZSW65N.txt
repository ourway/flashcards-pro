A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, reminiscent of classic British storybook illustrations. The scene depicts the UK Prime Minister, a figure with a kind, approachable face, standing in the center of a lush, green field that subtly resembles the shape of Great Britain. The field is populated by twenty meticulously drawn sheep, each wearing a miniature, uniquely designed ministerial sash in pastel colors (primarily blues, reds, and creams). The sheep are not identical; some are slightly larger, some have different wool textures, and their sashes bear different symbols relevant to various government departments (e.g., a tiny gear for industry, a stylized book for education, a miniature stethoscope for health). The Prime Minister gently gestures towards the group of sheep with a welcoming smile. Behind the field, rolling hills fade into a soft, pastel-colored sky with fluffy clouds. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, with the Prime Minister and the sheep forming a central focal point. The watercolor style should lend a soft, nostalgic feel to the image, making it memorable and easily associated with the concept of the Prime Minister appointing ministers. The color palette is predominantly pastel, with subtle accents of red and blue to evoke the colors of the UK flag without being overly patriotic. The image should avoid any harsh lines or overly bright colors, maintaining a gentle and inviting aesthetic.
