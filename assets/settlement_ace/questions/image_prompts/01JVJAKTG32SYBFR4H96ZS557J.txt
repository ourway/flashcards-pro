A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic, 2D watercolor illustration in a pastel color palette (primarily blues, reds and whites). The scene depicts the interior of a grand, yet approachable, hall reminiscent of the Houses of Parliament, but with a less intimidating atmosphere. Dominating the center is a figure representing a judge, wearing a powdered wig and judicial robes, but with a gentle, encouraging expression. The judge is pointing with a quill pen towards a large, open document resting on a table in front of them. The document is clearly marked with a stylized crest that represents the government, but the contents of the document are not legible and are represented by blurred handwriting. On the other side of the table are two figures representing government ministers, looking thoughtful and slightly embarrassed. One minister is holding a pen and has a hand resting on a stack of papers representing "policies," while the other is looking towards a distant building representing the Parliament. A beam of soft, natural light streams in from a high window, illuminating the scene and casting a warm glow on the document being reviewed. The overall composition should convey a sense of constructive dialogue and the importance of legal accountability within a democratic framework. The style should evoke a sense of classic British artistry, similar to historical illustrations found in children's books. The image should be free of any text.
