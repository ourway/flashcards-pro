A vividly detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, showcasing the symbolic union of England and Wales during the reign of Henry VIII. The composition centers around a majestic, verdant Welsh valley bathed in the soft glow of a sunrise. Dominating the foreground is a stylized yet realistic depiction of the Welsh Dragon, Y Ddraig Goch, its scales rendered in shades of crimson and gold, breathing a plume of white smoke that subtly morphs into the Tudor Rose, the floral emblem of England. The dragon is perched atop a rugged, rocky outcrop, symbolizing Wales' enduring strength and independence. Below, a gentle river flows, representing the shared waterways and resources, its banks lined with daffodils, the national flower of Wales. In the distance, rolling hills gradually transition into the English countryside, depicted with iconic thatched-roof cottages and fields of golden wheat. The sky above is a blend of pastel blues and pinks, evoking a sense of peace and unity, with faint, stylized crowns subtly embedded in the clouds, representing the monarchical rule. The color palette leans towards the red, white, and blue of the Union Jack, subtly woven into the landscape and the dragon's scales, along with the pastel shades, creating a harmonious and visually appealing representation of the historical unification.
