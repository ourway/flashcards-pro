A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a solitary golfer on a rugged, windswept Scottish Highland landscape. The scene is set in the 15th century. The golfer, dressed in traditional period attire consisting of earthy-toned woolen clothing, is in mid-swing, his form suggesting both power and precision. He holds a primitive wooden golf club. The landscape should dominate the composition, featuring rolling hills covered in heather and gorse, with a few scattered sheep grazing peacefully in the distance. A craggy, ancient stone castle ruin sits perched atop the highest hill in the background, partially obscured by mist. The sky is a blend of pastel blues and grays, hinting at an approaching storm. The overall color palette leans towards muted, earthy tones punctuated by the vibrant purple of the heather and the light green of the grass. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a sense of timelessness and history. A small, roughly sewn leather golf ball is visible in the air, just leaving the clubface. The overall impression should be one of serene isolation and the enduring legacy of the sport in its birthplace. The composition should draw the eye to the golfer as the main subject, with the surrounding landscape providing context and historical grounding. The image should not contain any text.
