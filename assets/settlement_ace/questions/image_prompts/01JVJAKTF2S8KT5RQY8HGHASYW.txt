A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image, ratio 16:9, depicting Geoffrey Chaucer as the central figure, riding a gentle, light-brown horse along a dusty road reminiscent of the English countryside. Chaucer, dressed in historically accurate medieval attire – a deep blue tunic, brown leather boots, and a tan-colored hood pulled slightly back to reveal his face – holds a quill pen in his right hand and a parchment scroll partially unfurled in his left. His expression is one of thoughtful observation, his gaze directed towards a diverse group of pilgrims travelling alongside him. The pilgrims, rendered in a pastel color palette, represent a cross-section of medieval society: a knight in shining (but slightly tarnished) armor, a rosy-cheeked miller, a nun with a serene expression, and a merchant counting coins. They are all walking and looking towards Chaucer, as if telling him their stories. The background features rolling green hills dotted with quaint thatched-roof cottages and a distant view of Canterbury Cathedral silhouetted against a soft, blue sky. The overall lighting suggests a bright, spring morning. The composition should be carefully balanced, with Chaucer and the pilgrims occupying the central space. The style should be realistic but with a gentle, storybook quality. The color palette should be dominated by the pastel hues of the English countryside with touches of red in the pilgrims' clothing.
