A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a whimsical scene celebrating St. David and St. Patrick's days in March. The composition is divided into two distinct halves, subtly blending in the center. On the left side, representing St. David's Day, a field of vibrant green leeks sprouts from the rolling Welsh hills under a soft, pastel blue sky. A traditional Welsh cottage with a smoking chimney sits nestled among the leeks. The colors are predominantly green and white, echoing the Welsh flag, with touches of pastel yellow in the sunlight. On the right side, for St. Patrick's Day, a lush Irish meadow is filled with shamrocks, their leaves a bright, cheerful green. A winding stone path leads to a quaint Irish village in the distance, with a round tower silhouette. A gentle rainbow arcs across the sky above the meadow, ending in a pot overflowing with golden coins, symbolizing Irish folklore. The colors are predominantly green and gold, with a hint of pastel orange in the setting sun. In the center, where the two halves merge, a delicate watercolor wash of pastel purple creates a harmonious transition. The overall mood is festive and celebratory, capturing the essence of both Welsh and Irish culture. The image should have a 16:9 ratio and landscape orientation.
