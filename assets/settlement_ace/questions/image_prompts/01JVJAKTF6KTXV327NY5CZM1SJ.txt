A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Moderator of the Church of Scotland. The central focus is on a distinguished, yet warm-faced individual, dressed in traditional ecclesiastical robes of deep navy blue, subtly accented with thin white piping, seated at the head of a long, polished wooden table. The table is surrounded by diverse figures representing the General Assembly, all listening attentively. The Moderator's hands are clasped lightly in front of them, conveying a sense of calm authority and thoughtful consideration. Positioned centrally behind the Moderator is a stained-glass window featuring a prominent Scottish thistle emblem, bathed in soft, diffused light. The color palette should predominantly feature the blues and whites reminiscent of the Scottish flag, with subtle touches of gold in the details of the robes and the window frame. The background includes subtle architectural elements suggesting the grand hall of the General Assembly, with high ceilings and ornate detailing, rendered in soft pastel shades to avoid distracting from the central figure. The overall composition should convey a sense of respect, tradition, and the temporary nature of the Moderator's one-year appointment, subtly symbolized by a single, freshly cut thistle lying on the table near the Moderator's hand. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a serene and contemplative atmosphere.
