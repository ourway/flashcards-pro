A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant scene centered around a classic links-style golf course. The golf course should appear to be on a coastline and be surrounded by sand dunes. The ratio should be 16:9. The sky should be overcast, with soft, diffused light casting subtle shadows across the landscape. In the foreground, a vintage leather-bound passport, embossed with the words "The Open Championship" in elegant gold lettering, lies open. Emerging from the passport is a miniature, stylized golf course, complete with meticulously rendered greens, fairways, and sand traps. A tiny golf ball is suspended mid-air, seemingly traveling from the miniature course within the passport to a full-sized golf hole on the main course, symbolizing the tournament's global reach. The color palette should be predominantly pastel, with muted greens and blues dominating the landscape. The passport itself is a rich brown leather, contrasted by the bright white of the pages and the gleaming gold lettering. Subtle details, such as blades of grass swaying in the breeze and the texture of the sand, should add depth and realism to the scene. The overall composition should evoke a sense of tradition, prestige, and international competition, emphasizing that The Open Championship transcends geographical boundaries.
