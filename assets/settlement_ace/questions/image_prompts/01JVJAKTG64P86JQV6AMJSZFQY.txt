A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic British botanical illustrations, depicting a vibrant scene embodying the concept of a free press. The central focus is a majestic, stylized bird, inspired by a blue tit but with subtle modifications to resemble a pen nib (feathers subtly shaped like nibs, ink-blue colour accents), soaring freely across a clear, pastel-blue sky. The bird carries a rolled-up newspaper tied with a red ribbon in its claws, the newspaper subtly illustrated with iconic UK landmarks as miniature printed images (Big Ben, Edinburgh Castle), symbolizing the breadth and scope of news coverage. Below, the landscape features rolling green hills dotted with quaint, pastel-colored cottages with terracotta roofs. There should be no visible figures or people in the image, just the landscape and the bird. Crucially, there are no cages, ropes, or any visual restraints present; only open skies and free-flowing movement, emphasizing the absence of government control. The overall color palette should lean towards soft, pastel shades of blue, green, red, and cream, evoking a sense of tranquility, freedom, and the historical weight of the UK's commitment to a free press. The composition should be balanced, with the bird centered in the frame against the vast sky, creating a feeling of unbound expression and liberty. Light should be soft and diffused, creating a gentle, informative, and memorable image.
