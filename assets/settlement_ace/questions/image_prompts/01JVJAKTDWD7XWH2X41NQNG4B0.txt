A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour illustration in a style reminiscent of vintage travel posters, showcasing the distinct landscapes of the four constituent countries of the UK. The composition is divided into four quadrants, each representing one country. The top-left quadrant features a rolling green English countryside with thatched-roof cottages and grazing sheep under a partly cloudy sky, using pastel green and yellow hues. The top-right quadrant depicts the rugged Scottish Highlands with a loch reflecting the dramatic mountain scenery, rendered in shades of deep blue, purple, and heather green. The bottom-left quadrant illustrates the Welsh coastline with a medieval castle perched on a cliff overlooking the sea, using a palette of soft blues, greys, and sandy beige. The bottom-right quadrant shows the green fields of Northern Ireland with the Giant's Causeway in the background, using pastel green and grey hues. The overall colour scheme should incorporate the colours of the UK flag (red, white, and blue) subtly within each quadrant, avoiding a literal representation. The artwork should emphasize natural light and shadow, creating a sense of depth and realism. A faint, circular frame of intertwined roses, thistles, daffodils, and shamrocks surrounds the central image, symbolizing the national flowers of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, respectively.
