A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a serene countryside scene under a pastel dawn sky. In the center of the image, a vibrantly decorated Easter egg rests gently nestled among freshly sprouted spring grass. The egg features delicate floral patterns in pastel shades of pink, yellow, and blue, and tiny, hand-painted Union Jack flags are subtly incorporated into the design. To the left of the Easter egg, a small, snow-dusted Christmas tree stands, adorned with miniature, glowing candles and a single, prominent star at its peak. The tree is subtly decorated with red and white ribbons that mirror colours of the UK flag. A faint, warm light emanates from the candles, casting a soft glow on the surrounding landscape. The background features rolling green hills fading into a misty horizon, punctuated by a quaint village church steeple in the distance. The overall color palette consists of soft pastel hues, with touches of vibrant colour on the Easter egg and Christmas tree, creating a harmonious and memorable visual representation of Easter and Christmas within a quintessential UK setting. The style should be realistic and detailed, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and the focus is on creating a peaceful, inviting, and subtly educational image.
