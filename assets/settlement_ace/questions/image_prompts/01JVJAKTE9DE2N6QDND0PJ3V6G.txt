A serene, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting a baptism ceremony in a quaint British countryside setting (16:9 aspect ratio). The central focus is on a person being gently lowered into a clear, flowing river by a pastor. The pastor is dressed in simple, but elegant robes, and his face exudes kindness and serenity. The river is surrounded by lush green meadows dotted with wildflowers in pastel shades of pink, blue, and yellow. Gentle sunlight filters through the leaves of the surrounding trees, creating dappled patterns on the water. A small, stone church with a traditional British design is visible in the background, nestled among the trees. A group of people, representing a diverse community, are gathered on the riverbank, observing the ceremony with expressions of peaceful reverence. Some hold hymn books. The overall color palette leans towards soft blues, greens, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag, with subtle accents of pastel colors in the wildflowers and clothing. The style should be realistic but with a gentle, painterly quality, avoiding harsh lines or overly sharp details. The entire scene should convey a sense of peace, community, and spiritual renewal, emphasizing the act of baptism as a central element of faith.
