A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting St. Augustine, garbed in traditional religious robes of muted cream and gold, standing on the white cliffs of Dover. His face is rendered with thoughtful detail, conveying determination and serenity. He is holding an antique compass with an ornate, Celtic-knot-inspired design on its casing. The compass needle is prominently pointing due south. Behind St. Augustine, several missionaries, also in similar robes but with variations in color (pale blues and soft reds, subtly echoing the Union Jack), are lined up, ready for their journey. The background features a calm, pastel-blue sea meeting a clear sky. The southern horizon is slightly warmer in tone, with hints of golden sunlight suggesting warmer territories. The overall composition should emphasize the southward direction, with the compass needle acting as a clear visual anchor. The light should be soft and diffused, creating a peaceful and reverent atmosphere. The artwork should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and religious purpose, using a pastel colour palette with small hints of the UK flag colours.
