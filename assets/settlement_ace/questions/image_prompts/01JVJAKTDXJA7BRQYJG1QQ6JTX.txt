A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a winding road stretching across the British Isles. The scene should evoke a sense of a long journey. The northernmost point of Scotland is marked by a quaint, pastel-colored village nestled amidst rugged, heather-covered hills, with a small lighthouse emitting a soft, warm glow. As the road meanders southward, it passes through rolling green fields dotted with grazing sheep, quintessential English countryside scenes, and quaint villages with stone houses and thatched roofs. The road eventually terminates at the southern coast of England, depicted with white chalk cliffs overlooking a calm, turquoise sea. Along the journey, subtly placed mile markers are visible, but blurred and indistinct, suggesting a vast distance. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, green, and beige, reminiscent of the UK's natural landscape. The sky is a soft, watercolour wash of pale blue, with delicate, wispy clouds suggesting a breezy day. The composition should emphasize the length and breadth of the journey, with the road acting as a central visual element, drawing the eye from north to south. The entire image should convey a sense of scale and distance, subtly hinting at the 870-mile separation.
