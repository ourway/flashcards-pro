A watercolor painting in a realistic style depicting a closed wooden door, bathed in soft, diffused light from a nearby window. The door is a muted pastel blue, reminiscent of classic British interiors. On the door, a delicately painted white rose, the flower of England, is prominently displayed. The rose is not fully bloomed, symbolizing something withheld or incomplete. The door handle is a simple, antique brass design. The wall around the door is a pale, warm grey. Emanating from beneath the door is a faint, ethereal glow, hinting at the light within. The overall composition should evoke a sense of privacy and the importance of boundaries. The light source should be positioned to cast gentle shadows, adding depth and realism to the scene. The colour palette should be soft and gentle, primarily consisting of pastel blues, whites, greys, and the warm tones of the brass handle, creating a calming and contemplative mood. The emphasis is on the closed door, the rose, and the light, symbolizing consent and privacy within a marriage.
