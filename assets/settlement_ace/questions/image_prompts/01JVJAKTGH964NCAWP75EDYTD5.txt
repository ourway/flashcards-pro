A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, rendered in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a stylized football stadium, depicted with sweeping arches and a lush green pitch. The stadium's architecture subtly incorporates elements of British design, such as miniature Big Ben-esque towers at each corner. Two stylized banners are draped on either side of the stadium. The banner on the left depicts a circle of united European flags surrounding a football, subtly alluding to UEFA's pan-European role. The banner on the right displays a majestic lion (a classic symbol of England) proudly guarding a football trophy, representing the Premier League. The colours should resemble the UK flag, with the stadium primarily in white, the banners predominantly in red and blue, and hints of green on the pitch. The sky above the stadium should be a soft, pastel blue, with gentle watercolor washes creating a sense of depth and atmosphere. The overall composition should evoke a feeling of excitement, unity, and the passionate spirit of football, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements. The illustration should highlight the connection between UEFA and the Premier League through symbolic representation, without including any text or numbers.
