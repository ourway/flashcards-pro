A serene, hand-drawn watercolour image depicting a tranquil English countryside scene under a pastel-hued sky. The composition is centered around a winding path leading to a small, stone church nestled amidst rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep. The path is subtly marked with 40 small stones, each progressively lighter in colour as they approach the church. Near the beginning of the path, a single, wilting violet flower (a symbol of repentance and humility) lies on the ground. Beside the path, a small, empty wooden bowl sits, suggesting a period of fasting or simple living. The church itself is bathed in a soft, warm light, emanating from within, hinting at hope and renewal. A single, leafless tree stands beside the church, its branches reaching towards the sky, subtly alluding to sacrifice and reflection. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, green, and lavender, creating a calming and contemplative atmosphere. The art style is realistic, with detailed rendering of the natural elements and architectural features, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements, so that it looks like a page from a vintage storybook. The entire image evokes a sense of peaceful contemplation and the passage of time, visually representing the 40 days of Lent leading up to Easter.
