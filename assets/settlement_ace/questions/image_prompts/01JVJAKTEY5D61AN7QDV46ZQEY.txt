A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style depicting Bodnant Garden in Wales. The image should be in a 16:9 landscape format, with the garden's main features centrally located. The composition showcases the iconic terraces cascading down towards the River Conwy, rendered with vibrant pastel hues of pink, blue, and green, subtly echoing the UK flag's colors. The upper terrace features meticulously manicured lawns and flowerbeds bursting with colorful blooms, including rhododendrons and azaleas, rendered with delicate brushstrokes to capture their intricate details. The lower terraces transition into a wilder, more naturalistic landscape, with towering trees and winding paths. The River Conwy flows gently in the background, reflecting the soft sunlight. A stone bridge arches gracefully over the river, adding a touch of architectural elegance. The overall atmosphere is one of tranquility and natural beauty. The sky is a soft, pastel blue with scattered fluffy clouds. The color palette should emphasize pastel colors to evoke a sense of calm and beauty. Focus on the vibrant flower displays and the overall terraced structure of the garden to make it instantly recognizable. The aim is to create a memorable image that embodies the essence of Bodnant Garden, aiding in recall for the test question.
