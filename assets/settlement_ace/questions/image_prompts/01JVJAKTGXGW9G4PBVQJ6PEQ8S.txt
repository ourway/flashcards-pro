A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a split scene. The left half of the 16:9 landscape showcases Edinburgh Castle perched atop its iconic volcanic rock, bathed in the soft, golden light of a late afternoon. The castle's stone walls are rendered with careful detail, highlighting the texture and history etched into them. Scottish flags flutter gently from the ramparts. The right half of the image transitions seamlessly to a view of the London Eye at twilight. The massive Ferris wheel is illuminated with a gentle, pastel blue glow, contrasting against the darkening sky. Silhouettes of London's cityscape, including the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben, are visible in the background. Wisps of clouds, rendered in light blues and pinks, drift across the sky, unifying the two halves of the composition. The color palette leans towards the UK flag's colors (red, white, and blue) but in a muted, pastel tone, creating a serene and memorable image. The illustration style is reminiscent of classic travel posters, aiming for a timeless and educational aesthetic.
