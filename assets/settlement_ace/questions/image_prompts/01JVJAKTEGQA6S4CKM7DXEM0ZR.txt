A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, rendered in a pastel color palette dominated by blues and reds. The scene depicts King Charles I dramatically entering the House of Commons. He is dressed in ornate royal regalia, including a deep blue velvet coat trimmed with gold lace, a large lace collar, and a feathered hat. His face shows a mixture of determination and arrogance. He is holding a royal scepter in his right hand, pointing it forward. Around him, startled Members of Parliament are depicted in various states of shock and defiance. Some are standing up from their benches, while others are whispering amongst themselves. The House of Commons is richly detailed, with dark wood paneling, ornate carvings, and rows of benches. Light streams in through large windows, illuminating the scene. The overall composition emphasizes the King's intrusion and the disruption of parliamentary proceedings. The atmosphere should feel tense and historically significant, capturing the moment before the English Civil War. The color palette is primarily pastel blues, reds, and creams, creating a visually appealing and memorable image. The art style is reminiscent of historical illustrations found in textbooks, aiming for clarity and realism.
