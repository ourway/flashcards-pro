A heartwarming, hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting a Nativity scene, bathed in soft, pastel colors. The central focus is the newborn baby Jesus lying in a manger, radiating a gentle, golden light. Mary and Joseph are kneeling beside him, their faces filled with love and adoration. Above them, a bright star shines in the dark blue night sky, its rays illuminating the scene below. Three wise men are approaching from the right, bearing gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, their camels adorned with colorful blankets. Shepherds are gathering from the left, their faces filled with wonder and awe. In the background, a small village nestled among rolling hills is visible, its windows glowing with warm light. The overall composition is designed to evoke a sense of peace, joy, and reverence, capturing the spirit of Christmas and its association with the birth of Jesus Christ. The color palette should consist primarily of soft blues, gentle pinks, muted yellows, and creams, creating a serene and inviting atmosphere. The style should be realistic, but with a touch of whimsy, avoiding harsh lines or overly detailed textures. The image should feel timeless and universally appealing, reminiscent of classic Christmas cards and children's book illustrations.
