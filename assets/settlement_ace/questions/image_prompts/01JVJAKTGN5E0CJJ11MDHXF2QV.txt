A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant phoenix rising majestically from a field of grey ashes. The phoenix, predominantly in hues of pastel blue and white, reminiscent of the UK flag, has feathers intricately detailed with subtle patterns representing different cultures and nations. Its wings are broad and outstretched, symbolizing unity and hope. Below the phoenix, the ashen landscape subtly transforms into fertile ground, with delicate green shoots emerging, indicating renewal and the promise of peace. The background features a soft, pastel sunrise, casting a warm glow on the scene, further emphasizing the idea of a new beginning. The composition is centered, with the phoenix as the focal point, surrounded by a circular arrangement of stylized, dove-like birds in flight, their forms barely visible against the brightening sky. The overall mood should evoke a sense of optimism and collaboration, highlighting the establishment of the United Nations after the devastation of World War II, not World War I. The image should not contain any text or numbers.
