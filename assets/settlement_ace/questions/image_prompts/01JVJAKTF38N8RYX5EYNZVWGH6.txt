A serene, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a fluffy, white lamb, Dolly, resting peacefully in a lush, green meadow reminiscent of the Scottish Highlands. The lamb is not an ordinary one; subtle, swirling patterns in its wool hint at its unique, cloned nature. Behind the lamb, in a soft-focus background, stand two figures: Sir Ian Wilmot and Keith Campbell. Wilmot, on the left, is depicted with a kind, intelligent face, gazing at the lamb with a gentle smile. Campbell, slightly behind him, is observing with a focused, analytical expression. Both figures are wearing lab coats, subtly hinting at their scientific profession. A DNA double helix, rendered in soft, pastel blues and pinks, gently arches above the scene, framing the lamb and the scientists. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, evoking a sense of calm and scientific precision, with touches of red in the meadow flowers to subtly reflect the colours of the UK flag. The style is realistic, avoiding cartoonish elements, to convey the seriousness and importance of the scientific achievement. The composition aims to capture the essence of the groundbreaking work while maintaining a gentle, approachable aesthetic.
