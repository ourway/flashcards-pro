A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, resembling a historical watercolor painting. The scene is set within a grand, ornate hall of a British palace, bathed in soft, diffused natural light. The central figure is George Frederick Handel, depicted with a powdered wig, period attire of deep blue velvet coat with gold embroidery, and a focused expression. He stands at a harpsichord, his fingers poised above the keys. King George I, dressed in regal red robes trimmed with ermine, sits attentively on a throne slightly elevated to the right of Handel. Musical notes, stylized and elegant, float upwards from the harpsichord, forming a gentle, swirling pattern that suggests harmony and melody. In the background, other members of the royal court are subtly visible, listening to the music. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel shades of blue, red, and gold, evoking the colors of the UK flag and adding to the historical atmosphere. The overall composition should be balanced, with Handel and King George I as the primary focal points, and the surrounding details contributing to the sense of grandeur and artistic creation.
