A hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting a classic English cricket scene. The image focuses on a cricket pitch rendered in lush green tones, subtly blending into a misty, rain-soaked atmosphere. A set of cricket stumps stands prominently in the center, slightly blurred by the falling rain. A vibrant red cricket ball is suspended mid-air, seemingly frozen in time just before it would hit the stumps. Above the pitch, dark grey rain clouds dominate the sky, with streaks of rain visibly descending. A classic red brick pavilion with a traditional clock tower is in the background, partially obscured by the rain and mist, adding an element of British architectural heritage. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with a dominance of greens, greys, and a pop of red from the cricket ball to draw the eye. The art style should be realistic and detailed, emphasizing the texture of the grass, the weight of the rain, and the historical feel of the pavilion. The composition should create a sense of anticipation and the temporary stillness caused by the rain, highlighting the phrase 'rain stopped play' in the context of cricket.
