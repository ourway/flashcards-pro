A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, depicting the Battle of Hastings. The scene unfolds on a rolling green hill under a turbulent, pastel-blue sky streaked with hints of red, reminiscent of the UK flag's color palette. In the center, William the Conqueror, clad in Norman armor with a kite shield bearing a stylized golden lion, sits atop a white steed, his gaze resolute. He points towards the English forces, a mass of soldiers with round shields and axes, positioned defensively on the crest of the hill. Arrows arc through the air, creating a sense of dynamic movement. The foreground features fallen soldiers, their armor and weapons scattered, subtly implying the aftermath of intense combat. The composition emphasizes the clash between the Norman cavalry and the English infantry, highlighting the tactical differences between the two armies. The background fades into a soft, misty landscape, suggesting the vastness of the battlefield and the historical significance of the event. The overall tone is dramatic yet educational, aiming to capture the intensity of the battle while remaining accessible and visually engaging. The art style should evoke the Bayeux Tapestry, with attention to detail in the armor, weaponry, and facial expressions of the figures.
