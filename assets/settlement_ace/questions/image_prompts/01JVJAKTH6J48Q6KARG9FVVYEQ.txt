A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor painting depicting the Falkland Islands. The scene is a panoramic landscape with a 16:9 aspect ratio, the main subject centered in the image. The foreground features the rugged, windswept coastline of the islands, complete with rocky outcrops and sparse, hardy vegetation in muted greens and browns. A flock of majestic albatrosses soars gracefully overhead, their wings catching the diffused sunlight. In the middle ground, a small settlement with brightly colored houses (predominantly red, white, and blue, reminiscent of the Union Jack) huddles protectively against the elements. A prominent flagpole displays the Union Jack, clearly visible and waving gently in the breeze. In the background, rolling hills fade into a misty horizon, suggesting the islands' remote location. The overall color palette is pastel, creating a soft and serene atmosphere. The sky should be predominantly light blue with scattered, fluffy white clouds. The sea is a deep turquoise, hinting at the cold waters surrounding the islands. The art style should evoke a sense of realism and geographical accuracy, capturing the unique beauty and isolation of the Falkland Islands. The composition should emphasize the vastness of the landscape and the smallness of the human settlement, highlighting the islands' distant and protected status. The overall mood is peaceful and evocative, suggesting a place of quiet resilience and natural beauty.
