A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a cutaway view of a majestic, Victorian-era steam engine powering a bustling textile mill. The engine's brass and iron components gleam with reflected light, showcasing intricate details of pistons, valves, and gears in operation. Wisps of steam escape from various joints and pipes, rendered in soft, translucent blues and whites. The color palette should be primarily pastel. The background shows a busy textile mill interior with workers operating looms, creating fabrics with vibrant colors. The overall atmosphere should evoke a sense of progress, innovation, and the energy of the Industrial Revolution. Light streams in from arched windows, casting dramatic shadows and highlighting the machinery's complexity. A subtle gradient in the background fades from a pale blue at the top to a warm beige near the bottom, providing depth and focus. The composition should emphasize the steam engine as the central element, with the textile mill serving as a dynamic backdrop to illustrate its impact. The steam engine and the textile mill should be in the center of the 16:9 ratio image.
