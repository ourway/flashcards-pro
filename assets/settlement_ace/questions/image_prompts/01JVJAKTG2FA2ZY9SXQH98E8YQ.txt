A meticulously detailed, watercolor-style illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The color palette leans heavily on pastel shades of blue, red, and white, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag. The central focus is on two figures, Gertrude Jekyll and Edwin Lutyens, depicted from the waist up. Gertrude, on the left, has short, neatly styled hair and wears a practical gardening dress, her hands adorned with gardening gloves gently holding a vibrant assortment of flower seedlings: lavender, roses, and delphiniums. Edwin, on the right, is dressed in a tailored tweed suit, holding architectural plans in one hand and a finely crafted trowel in the other. Their hands are positioned close together in the center of the image, as if they are collaborating and about to work together. The background features a stylized representation of a classic English garden. On Gertrude's side, the garden is lush and overflowing with colorful flowers in a cottage garden style, while Edwin's side showcases structured elements like symmetrical hedges, stone pathways, and an elegant gazebo in the distance. The sky overhead is a soft, watercolor wash of pastel blue, with fluffy white clouds adding depth to the scene. The overall composition should evoke a sense of harmony, collaboration, and the timeless beauty of English garden design.
