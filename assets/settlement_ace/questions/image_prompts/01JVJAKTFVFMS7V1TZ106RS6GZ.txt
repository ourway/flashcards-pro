A serene, hand-drawn watercolor landscape depicting Loch Lomond in Scotland. The loch itself dominates the center of the 16:9 composition, its surface reflecting the soft, pastel hues of the sky above â€“ primarily light blues, pinks, and gentle purples. The water is still, with subtle ripples suggesting a gentle breeze. Surrounding the loch are rolling hills and mountains, painted in shades of green and brown, gradually fading into a misty, blueish-grey distance. On the left side of the loch, a lone Scottish Highland cow grazes peacefully, its reddish-brown coat contrasting against the green grass. To the right, a traditional stone cottage with a thatched roof sits nestled amongst the trees, smoke gently curling from its chimney. In the foreground, near the bottom of the image, a patch of vibrant purple heather flowers adds a touch of color. A faint outline of a bagpipe rests subtly in the sky above the loch, almost translucent, serving as a visual reminder of Scotland. The overall style should be realistic and painterly, with soft edges and a focus on capturing the natural beauty of the Scottish Highlands. The color palette should be predominantly pastel, with accents of red and purple, creating a calming and memorable image.
