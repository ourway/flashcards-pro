A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a circular table viewed from above. Around the table are fifteen distinct chairs, each occupied by a symbolic figure representing a nation. The figures are not caricatures but subtly represent different cultures through clothing, posture, and minimal symbolic items placed on the table in front of them. The table itself is polished wood, reflecting the light, and has a subtle inlaid design resembling a compass rose, symbolizing global direction and peacekeeping. The color palette leans towards pastel blues and creams, interspersed with subtle reds and whites reminiscent of the UK flag, creating a calming and diplomatic atmosphere. In the very center of the table sits a stylized, ornate dove, its wings slightly spread as if about to take flight, representing peace and harmony. The background is a soft, diffused light, giving the impression of a grand, historically significant room within the UN headquarters. The lighting is focused on the table and the figures, highlighting their attentiveness and the importance of their meeting. The overall composition is balanced and symmetrical, emphasizing unity and collaboration.
