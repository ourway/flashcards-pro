A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a symbolic representation of Bulgaria and the Austro-Hungarian Empire as allies during World War I. The scene is set against a muted, pastel blue sky (reminiscent of the UK flag's blue). The primary subject is a majestic lion (representing Bulgaria) standing shoulder-to-shoulder with a double-headed eagle (representing the Austro-Hungarian Empire). The lion is adorned with a delicate garland of roses, Bulgaria's national flower, draped around its neck. The double-headed eagle clutches a shield with a stylized imperial crest. Beneath their feet, the landscape transitions from a field of roses to a mountainous terrain, symbolizing the geographical diversity of the two empires. Subtle, faded imagery of soldiers marching in the background evokes the era of World War I, but avoids any graphic or violent content. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, mirroring the colors of the UK flag and creating a sense of historical solemnity. The composition is centered, with the lion and eagle as the focal point, emphasizing their alliance. The style should evoke a sense of historical documentation, akin to a beautifully rendered illustration from a vintage history book.
