A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a pastel color palette (primarily blues, reds, and creams), depicting a jury deliberation room in a British courthouse. The room is softly lit by diffused daylight filtering through a tall, arched window. Twelve diverse figures, representing a cross-section of the UK population, are seated around a large, polished mahogany table. The central focus is a symbolic, antique balance scale resting on the table's surface. One pan of the scale holds a stylized feather representing innocence, while the other contains a heavy, intricately designed iron weight symbolizing guilt. The scale is subtly tilted towards the feather, but the jury members are shown in deep contemplation, their expressions serious and thoughtful. Papers representing evidence are scattered across the table. The background features subtle details like a framed portrait of the reigning monarch and a bookshelf filled with legal texts, reinforcing the setting. The overall composition should convey a sense of solemnity, responsibility, and the careful consideration required in the pursuit of justice. The style should evoke classic courtroom sketches, aiming for clarity and emotional impact rather than photorealism.
