A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, ratio 16:9, depicting a vibrant New Year's Eve celebration in London. The focal point is the iconic Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) with a dazzling display of fireworks exploding around it. The fireworks are in the color palette of the UK flag – predominantly red, white, and blue – creating starburst patterns and trails of light against the dark blue night sky. Below, the River Thames reflects the colorful explosions, adding depth and mirroring the festive scene. Silhouetted figures of people are gathered along the riverbank, their faces tilted upwards in awe and celebration, some holding sparklers. The overall composition is symmetrical, with Big Ben at the center, drawing the viewer's eye. The watercolor style should give a soft, ethereal quality to the light and colors, enhancing the celebratory atmosphere. The scene should evoke a sense of joy, unity, and the welcoming of a new year in a distinctly British setting. The image should be rich in detail, capturing the energy and excitement of the New Year's celebration without including any text. The colors should predominantly be pastel-like, with the strong accents of red, white, and blue from the fireworks.
