A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting two distinct figures standing on a gently rolling, green hillside under a pastel blue sky with fluffy white clouds. The composition is centered. On the left stands St. David, identifiable by his traditional Welsh attire: a simple, dark robe, a Celtic cross hanging around his neck, and a leek pinned to his robe, representing Wales. He holds a staff and has a serene, wise expression. To the right stands St. Patrick, clad in green robes, holding a shamrock in one hand and a bishop's crosier in the other, symbolizing Ireland. A faint golden halo surrounds the heads of both saints. Between them, on the grassy hill, small daffodils (representing Wales) and shamrocks (representing Ireland) bloom in abundance, creating a field of pastel yellow and green. The overall color palette should be reminiscent of the UK flag - pastel reds, whites, and blues subtly incorporated into the landscape and sky, with the greens and golds of the saints' attire and the flora dominating the foreground. The style should be reminiscent of classic botanical illustrations, with meticulous detail given to the plants and the textures of the saints' robes. The backdrop includes a glimpse of rolling hills fading into the distance, evoking the landscapes of both Wales and Ireland.
