A heartwarming, realistically rendered watercolour illustration depicting a golden retriever standing proudly in a lush green park, bathed in soft, early morning light. The park should feature quintessential British elements like a classic red telephone box in the background, partially obscured by a blossoming cherry tree. The focus is on the dog's collar, which is a simple, brown leather collar. A tiny, intricately detailed tag hangs from the collar. Upon closer inspection, the tag is stylized to resemble a miniature front door of a terraced house, complete with a tiny number above the door. The overall colour palette should be dominated by pastel shades of green, blue, and cream, evoking a sense of tranquility and nostalgia, while the red telephone box provides a striking contrast. The retriever should have a friendly, intelligent expression, and its fur should be realistically textured. The style should be reminiscent of Beatrix Potter's illustrations, emphasizing naturalism and gentle charm. The composition should be balanced, with the dog centrally positioned and the background elements adding context without distracting from the main subject: the collar and its symbolic tag.
