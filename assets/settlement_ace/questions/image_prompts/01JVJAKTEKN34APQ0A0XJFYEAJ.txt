A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical portraiture. The scene centers on Mary, Queen of Scots, depicted as a regal figure with a melancholic expression. She stands within the confines of a stylized, yet elegant, stone tower window. The window is partially open, revealing a glimpse of the rolling green hills of the English countryside under a cloudy sky. Mary wears a dark blue velvet gown, embroidered with subtle thistle patterns (a symbol of Scotland) in lighter blue thread. Her red hair is neatly styled, and she wears a simple pearl necklace. Her hands are clasped gently in front of her, suggesting a sense of resignation. The tower room is sparsely furnished with a wooden stool and a woven tapestry depicting the Scottish flag in faded pastel colours. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a somber atmosphere. A single shaft of light illuminates Mary's face, highlighting her eyes. The overall color palette should lean towards muted blues, greens, and grays, evoking a sense of historical authenticity and reflecting the somber mood of her imprisonment. The image should convey a sense of confinement and lost power, illustrating the essence of her two-decade imprisonment in England due to suspicions of plotting against the throne.
