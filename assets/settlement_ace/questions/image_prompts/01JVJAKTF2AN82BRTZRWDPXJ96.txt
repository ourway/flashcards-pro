A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting two distinct island landscapes side-by-side, divided by a subtle, wavy line representing the vast ocean. The left side portrays St. Helena: a lush, volcanic island with steep cliffs rising from the turquoise sea. Atop one of the cliffs, a solitary, regal-looking stone house stands, partially obscured by vibrant green foliage. A faint, spectral figure of Napoleon Bonaparte, dressed in his iconic military attire, gazes pensively towards the horizon. The British flag is subtly incorporated as a small flag on top of the stone house. The right side showcases the Falkland Islands: a rugged, windswept archipelago with rocky coastlines and rolling, grassy hills. A flock of penguins waddles comically across the foreground, while a lone sheep grazes peacefully on a distant hillside. Above, a silhouette of a Royal Navy ship sails on the horizon, a subtle reminder of the islands' historical significance. The overall color palette should be pastel, with blues and greens dominating the island landscapes and a touch of red and white in the British flags and the naval ship, maintaining a harmonious and educational visual. The artwork is framed in a 16:9 ratio, with the primary subjects centered to capture the essence of both territories within the frame.
