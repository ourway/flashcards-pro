A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical textbook illustrations. The image, in a 16:9 landscape format, centers on a grand, ornate oil lamp, its brass polished to a warm glow. The lamp sits atop a stack of leather-bound books, their spines subtly hinting at titles of philosophy, science, and literature through embossed designs. Emanating from the lamp is a radiant, golden light that illuminates the scene. The light subtly reveals a backdrop featuring a stylized, almost ethereal representation of significant Enlightenment figures like Isaac Newton gazing through a telescope, and Voltaire holding a quill, deep in thought. The colour palette is predominantly warm, using variations of gold, ochre, and sepia to emphasize the "enlightenment" theme, accented with subtle blues and reds, reminiscent of the UK flag, in the books' spines and background elements. The composition emphasizes the lamp as the central source of knowledge and reason, with the figures in the background appearing as if emerging from the shadows, bathed in its illuminating glow. The overall mood is one of intellectual curiosity, progress, and the power of reason, acting as a mnemonic for the 18th century Enlightenment. The scene should be devoid of any text or numbers, focusing solely on visual storytelling.
