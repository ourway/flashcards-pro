A watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a woman gracefully walking through a lush English garden. The garden is filled with blooming roses in pastel shades of pink, cream, and lavender, with winding stone paths and a gentle fountain in the background. The woman is dressed in a flowing, elegant gown in shades of white and light blue, reminiscent of the Regency era. Her hair is styled in soft curls, and she carries a delicate parasol. Soft, diffused sunlight filters through the trees, creating a serene and ethereal atmosphere. Focus on the woman's graceful posture and radiant beauty as she moves, capturing the essence of the poem "She Walks in Beauty." The composition should be centered, with the garden acting as a frame for the woman, emphasizing her central role. The color palette should evoke the colors of the UK flag, with subtle hints of red, white, and blue integrated into the garden's foliage and the woman's attire. The overall mood is romantic and contemplative, reflecting the poetic nature of Lord Byron's work. The image should feel both timeless and distinctly British, capturing the beauty of the English countryside and the elegance of the Regency period.
