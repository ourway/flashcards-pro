A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style, capturing the essence of the English Civil War. The scene is set against a backdrop of rolling green hills, reminiscent of the English countryside. Dominating the center of the 16:9 frame are three Cavaliers on horseback. The riders are adorned in elaborate, but not overly ornate, 17th-century attire â€“ think polished breastplates, feathered hats (primarily in shades of deep blue and crimson), and lace collars. Their horses are strong and well-groomed, a mix of browns and blacks with white markings. One Cavalier, positioned slightly ahead of the others, carries a banner emblazoned with a stylized golden crown, subtly hinting at their allegiance to the King. Sunlight filters through a break in the clouds, illuminating the lead Cavalier and his banner, drawing the viewer's eye to the symbol of royalty. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, evoking a sense of historical distance and romanticism. The horses should appear to be galloping towards the "viewer", with their manes blowing back. The painting should focus on portraying the Cavaliers as noble and valiant figures, not as aggressors, but as supporters of the crown. The overall mood is one of determined loyalty and unwavering support.
