A hand-drawn, realistic watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a symbolic "River of Time" flowing across a serene English countryside. The river's source begins at a vibrant, youthful scene with an 18-year-old figure standing confidently near a blossoming apple tree, representing the minimum age for jury service. As the river meanders towards the center, the landscape gradually matures, showing scenes of people from various walks of life, subtly hinting at the diverse composition of a jury. The river eventually reaches its endpoint with a wise, elderly figure around 70 years old, peacefully fishing by the riverbank under the warm glow of a setting sun. The figure is holding a fishing rod, and the line is reaching a small, almost invisible, full stop in the water. The colour palette should primarily be pastel shades, with touches of red, white, and blue subtly incorporated into the landscape â€“ red poppies in the fields, white clouds in the sky, and a hint of blue in the river itself. The overall composition should evoke a sense of tranquility and the passage of time, subtly reinforcing the concept that there's an upper age limit (around 70) for jury service in the UK, mirroring the natural progression of life. The style should be reminiscent of classic English landscape paintings.
