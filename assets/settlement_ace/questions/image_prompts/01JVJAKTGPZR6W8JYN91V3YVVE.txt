A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format, dominated by a serene pastel blue and white color palette. The central focus is a grand, classically British government building, reminiscent of the Houses of Parliament but subtly stylized to avoid direct representation. In front of the building stands a line of diverse individuals, representing civil servants. They are dressed in professional attire, each holding a symbolic, unbloomed white rose, representing their neutrality and impartiality. The roses are the only objects with a slight touch of pastel red, providing a subtle nod to the UK flag. The civil servants are facing away from a brightly lit stage to the right of the building, where a figure is giving a speech. The speaker is bathed in warm light, symbolizing the political arena. A faint, transparent barrier visually separates the civil servants from the stage, emphasizing their separation from politics. The overall composition evokes a sense of calm professionalism and highlights the concept of political neutrality. The sky above is a soft gradient of pastel blue and white, suggesting clarity and impartiality. The style should be realistic but with a gentle, educational feel, avoiding any harsh lines or overly dramatic shading.
