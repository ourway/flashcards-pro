A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the modern Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh against a backdrop of a clear, pastel blue sky. The building should be rendered with meticulous detail, showcasing its unique architectural features, constructed from Scottish materials: granite, oak and steel. In the foreground, a symbolic representation of a blossoming thistle, the national flower of Scotland, should be prominently displayed. The thistle is depicted in shades of purple and green, with dew drops clinging to its petals, reflecting the soft sunlight. Behind the thistle, a gently flowing river represents the River Forth, which is near the Parliament in Holyrood. Emerging from the riverbank, stylized Celtic knot patterns intertwine, symbolizing Scotland's rich cultural heritage and continuity. The composition should be balanced, with the Parliament building centrally positioned, drawing the eye to its grand presence. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel blues, greens, purples, and a touch of gold to evoke a sense of serenity, progress, and Scottish pride. The time of day is early morning, with soft light casting gentle shadows, suggesting a new dawn for Scottish governance.
