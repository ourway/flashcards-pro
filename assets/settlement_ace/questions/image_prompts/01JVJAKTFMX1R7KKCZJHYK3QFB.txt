A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a regal, yet somber scene. The composition is centered on a figure representing Pope Clement VII, adorned in traditional papal robes of white and gold, seated on an ornate throne within a grand hall reminiscent of the Vatican. The throne is positioned slightly off-center, allowing for a view of the architectural details of the hall, including arched doorways and stained-glass windows filtering soft, diffused light. To the left of the Pope, partially obscured in shadow, is a kneeling figure representing King Henry VIII, depicted with a concerned expression and wearing royal attire with Tudor roses subtly woven into the fabric. His hands are clasped in supplication. Between them, resting on a velvet cushion, is a golden ring symbolizing marriage, radiating a soft, warm light. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, gold, and cream, with accents of red in the papal insignia, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag without being overt. The background features delicate details of Renaissance-era artwork and architecture, reinforcing the historical context. The scene conveys a sense of solemnity and the weight of the decision resting on the Pope, highlighting his authority in matters of marriage during that era. The image should evoke a feeling of historical importance and religious significance, emphasizing the power dynamic between the King and the Pope, to remind the user that Henry VIII needed approval from the Pope to get a divorce.
