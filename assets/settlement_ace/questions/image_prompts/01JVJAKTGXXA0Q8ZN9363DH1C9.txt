A meticulously hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a gently rolling green hillside under a pastel blue sky. Scattered across the hillside are stylized sheep, each representing one million people. The sheep are primarily white, with subtle variations in shading to avoid monotony. A small number of sheep are colored in pastel red and blue, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag and adding visual interest. The sheep are clustered loosely, but there are approximately 62 sheep visible, with a few more partially obscured by the gentle undulation of the hill, suggesting "just over" the counted number. In the center of the landscape, a slightly larger, more detailed sheep stands out, subtly representing the "over" part of "just over." The overall composition should evoke a sense of peaceful abundance and gentle growth. The horizon line is slightly lower than center, emphasizing the expanse of the sky. Use a soft, pastel color palette predominantly, with hints of brighter blues and reds to subtly connect the image to British symbolism without being overt. The art style should resemble a children's book illustration, focusing on clarity and gentle realism, avoiding harsh lines or stark contrasts. The entire scene should be framed within a 16:9 aspect ratio, with the main cluster of sheep concentrated in the central area to ensure visibility and focus.
