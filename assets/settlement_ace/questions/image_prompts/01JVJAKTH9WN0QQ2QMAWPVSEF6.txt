A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour illustration depicting the Palace of Westminster, viewed from a slightly elevated perspective across the River Thames, under a clear, pastel-blue sky. The Houses of Parliament should be the central focus, rendered with realistic architectural detail, including the Victoria Tower and the clock tower (Big Ben). The colour palette should predominantly feature pastel shades of blue, red, and white, reminiscent of the Union Jack.

Within the Houses of Parliament, subtly suggest the presence of the public galleries. This can be achieved by slightly illuminating small, arched windows on the upper levels of the building, hinting at observers within. From these windows, faint, pastel-coloured light beams extend outwards, almost imperceptibly, towards stylized representations of diverse members of the British public depicted in the foreground.

In the foreground, the River Thames is calm and reflects the pastel colours of the sky and the Houses of Parliament. A few stylized boats gently glide across the water. The overall composition should convey a sense of openness and accessibility, symbolizing the public's right to observe parliamentary debates. The art style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, with a focus on soft, blended colours and gentle linework to create an inviting and educational image. The drawing should resemble a watercolour painting with visible brushstrokes, adding to its artistic and approachable feel.
