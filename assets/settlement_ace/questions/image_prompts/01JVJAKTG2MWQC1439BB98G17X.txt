A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image depicting a somber scene representing the separation of Japan from the Allied forces during World War II. The composition is centered, adhering to the 16:9 ratio. The left side features a British bulldog, rendered in realistic detail with a determined expression, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with an American bald eagle and a Russian bear, all symbolizing the Allied powers. Each animal wears a miniature helmet reminiscent of WWII-era military headgear. A faded, pastel-colored Union Jack drapes subtly behind them, adding a touch of British identity. The right side shows a solitary Japanese rising sun flag, its rays appearing sharp and almost menacing. The flag is subtly torn around the edges, symbolizing isolation and conflict. A symbolic, stylized map of the world lies subtly beneath their feet, with Europe and parts of Asia depicted. A crack runs across the map, visually separating Japan from the Allied nations, highlighting the division. The color palette predominantly uses muted blues, reds, and whites, echoing the Union Jack, alongside the red and white of the Japanese flag, creating a visual contrast. The overall art style should evoke a sense of historical gravity and the clear division between the Allies and Japan.
