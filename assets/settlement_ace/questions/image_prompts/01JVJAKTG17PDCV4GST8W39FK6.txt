A hand-drawn, realistic 2D landscape depicting the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, rendered in a watercolor style with a pastel color palette dominated by blues, grays, and muted oranges. The composition should focus on the unique hexagonal basalt columns that form the Causeway, emphasizing their tightly packed arrangement and varying heights. In the midground, visualize the columns extending into the sea, partially submerged and reflecting the sky above. The sea should be a calm, pastel blue, contrasting gently with the gray and orange hues of the basalt. Rising from behind the Causeway, in the far distance, paint a stylized, dormant volcano with subtle wisps of smoke emanating from its peak, hinting at its past activity. The sky should be a soft gradient of pastel blues and oranges, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The overall mood should be serene and educational, emphasizing the natural beauty and geological origins of the Giant's Causeway. The artistic style should be reminiscent of a vintage travel poster, aiming for clarity and visual appeal rather than hyperrealism, so the viewer can see the link between the volcano and the structure.
