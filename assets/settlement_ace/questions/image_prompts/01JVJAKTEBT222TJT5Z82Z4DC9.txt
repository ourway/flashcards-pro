A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style (no cartoonish or abstract elements), depicting an imaginary meeting between Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and J.K. Rowling inside a grand, classically British library. The library's architecture features high arched windows allowing soft, natural light to illuminate the scene, revealing shelves overflowing with aged, leather-bound books. Doyle, dressed in a tweed suit and sporting his iconic mustache, sits in a comfortable armchair. Opposite him, J.K. Rowling, in a smart, modern dress, is seated similarly. A low, round table sits between them, laden with a delicate china tea set. Steam gently rises from the teacups, hinting at a pleasant conversation. A magnifying glass rests casually on a nearby open book, subtly alluding to Sherlock Holmes. In the background, partially obscured by bookshelves, a faint, magical aura surrounds a stack of books, hinting at the wizarding world of Harry Potter. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues, with touches of red, white, and blue subtly integrated into the book bindings, the rug beneath their feet, and the floral pattern of the china, creating a visual link to the UK flag without being overt. The composition should be centered, with Doyle and Rowling as the focal point, surrounded by the warm, inviting atmosphere of the quintessential British library.
