A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a vintage storybook illustration. The scene depicts a quaint British tea room, bathed in soft, pastel hues of blues, pinks, and creams. A woman dressed in a floral dress sits at a table, looking slightly concerned as she looks at a bill. Across from her sits a friendly-looking, elderly gentleman with a neatly trimmed grey beard, wearing a tweed jacket. He is extending his hand towards her, not in a threatening manner, but in a gesture of understanding and patience. The table is adorned with a delicate china tea set, scones, and clotted cream. Behind them, through a large, arched window, the rolling green hills of the English countryside are visible, dotted with sheep. A subtle, almost imperceptible, halo of light surrounds the woman, signifying that she is not in any immediate danger or criminal predicament. This halo gently fades into the background, creating a soft, dreamlike quality. The overall composition is warm and inviting, suggesting a civil discussion rather than a criminal investigation. The scene should feel calm and non-threatening. The art style should evoke a sense of nostalgia and classic British charm, like a scene from a Beatrix Potter book. The color palette should lean toward pastel shades, accented with the occasional pop of red from a rose in a vase on the table, subtly reflecting the colors of the British flag.
