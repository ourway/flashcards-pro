A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style (no cartoonish features), ratio 16:9, depicting a lone figure standing on a cobbled London street corner. The figure, instantly recognizable as Charlie Chaplin's "Tramp," is dressed in his signature attire: a tattered black coat slightly too big, oversized shoes, baggy trousers held up by a rope, and a small bowler hat perched jauntily on his head. He carries a thin cane and sports his iconic toothbrush moustache. The colour palette should strongly resemble the UK flag; therefore, the sky behind him is a muted, overcast grey-blue, hinting at a London drizzle. The cobblestones are a deep, weathered grey. The "Tramp's" clothing is predominantly dark, with subtle hints of red and white in the patches and repairs. The background features a muted, slightly out-of-focus watercolour rendering of typical London buildings: a pub with a hanging sign, a small shop with a window display, and a glimpse of a red telephone box. The overall composition should evoke a sense of wistful humour and resilience in the face of adversity, capturing the essence of Chaplin's iconic character and his enduring appeal. The light should be soft and diffused, mimicking the natural light of a cloudy London day. The focus is on the Tramp's face and his expressive eyes, which should convey a mix of vulnerability and hope.
