A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting two distinct scenes subtly merged to represent Ellie Simmonds and David Weir. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag but in softer tones. On the left side, the focus is on Ellie Simmonds: imagine a stylized swimming pool with gentle, flowing water. A determined swimmer, depicted with realistic proportions and features, is mid-stroke, creating ripples in the water. Her face shows intense concentration and determination. The swimmer should be visibly shorter than average, with subtle physical characteristics that hint at dwarfism without being overly emphasized or stereotypical. On the right side, David Weir is represented by a stylized Olympic track. A wheelchair racer, also realistically drawn, is powerfully propelling himself forward. His posture exudes strength and speed. The wheelchair is meticulously detailed. The background behind both athletes is blurred, using soft watercolor washes to suggest the energy and crowds of the Paralympic Games. The two scenes blend seamlessly in the middle, with water ripples subtly transitioning into track lines, symbolizing the unity of Paralympic sports. The overall composition should be balanced and harmonious, creating a sense of dynamism and inspiration.
