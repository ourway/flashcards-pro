A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, focusing on the cultural exchange between India and Britain. The central composition features two distinct scenes seamlessly blended. On the left side, depicting India, is a vibrant curry house bustling with activity. Chefs in traditional Indian attire are preparing dishes, with visible steam and aromatic spices subtly implied through color and detail. Patrons, dressed in colorful Indian clothing, are seated at tables, enjoying their meals. The color palette leans towards warm reds, oranges, and yellows, suggestive of the spices and warmth of Indian cuisine. On the right side, representing Britain, is a serene scene of a Victorian-era salon. A woman with her hair loosely tied is reclining in a chair, receiving a shampoo from an attendant. The color palette here is softer, utilizing pastel blues, creams, and gentle greens, reflecting the tranquility and cleanliness of the salon. Connecting these two scenes is a subtle, flowing river of aromatic steam, visually linking the curry spices to the shampoo scents. This river visually symbolizes the introduction of these elements to Britain. The background is a soft blend of the British and Indian flags' colors, creating a harmonious and educational image. The image must have a 16:9 landscape ratio with the main subject centered.
