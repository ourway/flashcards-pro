A vibrant, hand-drawn 2D image in watercolor style, reminiscent of classic children's book illustrations. The scene is set against a soft, pastel sky of blues and pinks. In the center, a split composition: on the left, a crescent moon hangs gently above a warmly lit home, signifying Eid ul-Fitr. Families are gathered, their faces glowing with joy as they share food and gifts. Lanterns with intricate cut-out designs emit a soft, golden light. On the right side, Diwali is represented by a collection of earthen diyas (oil lamps) arranged in a circular pattern. These lamps are brightly lit, casting a warm and inviting glow that seems to dance with the light from the Eid lanterns. Around the diyas, stylized rangoli patterns are drawn in vibrant colors – reds, oranges, yellows, and greens – creating a sense of festivity and intricate beauty. A subtle, almost ethereal line divides the two scenes, but the overall effect is one of harmony and shared celebration. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, with accents of vibrant reds, greens, and golds to highlight the festive elements. The style should be realistic but retain a gentle, artistic feel, avoiding harsh lines or overly detailed textures. The image should evoke a sense of warmth, happiness, and the distinct cultural richness of both Eid ul-Fitr and Diwali.
