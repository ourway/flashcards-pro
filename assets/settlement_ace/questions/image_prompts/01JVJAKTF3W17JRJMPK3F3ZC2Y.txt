A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, portraying a "Cavalier" during the English Civil War, ratio 16:9. The central figure is a young, handsome nobleman, a Cavalier, dressed in exquisitely rendered 17th-century attire. His long, dark, wavy hair flows dramatically around his shoulders. He wears a lavishly decorated, dark blue velvet doublet, adorned with intricate gold embroidery, open to reveal a pristine white lace collar. A crimson sash is draped across his chest, and he wears tall, polished black leather boots. Atop his head, he sports a wide-brimmed, dark blue felt hat, adorned with a long, elegant white feather that gracefully curves downwards. He holds a sheathed sword in his left hand, its hilt gleaming gold. The Cavalier stands in a field, with a stately English manor house visible in the soft-focused background under a pastel blue sky. The overall color palette should lean towards the colors of the UK flag - primarily blues and reds, with accents of gold and white, rendered in soft, diffused watercolor tones. The composition should capture a sense of noble defiance and unwavering loyalty, embodying the spirit of the Cavaliers during the English Civil War. The lighting is soft and diffuse, creating a sense of historical gravitas and artistic refinement.
