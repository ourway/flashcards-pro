A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting three distinct, yet interconnected scenes representing the works of Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy, and Jane Austen. The image is framed in a 16:9 landscape format, with the scenes balanced across the canvas. The left side features a bustling, slightly grimy, Victorian London street scene, evoking Dickens' "Oliver Twist." Cobblestone streets glisten with rain, reflecting gaslight, and a young boy, Oliver, peers hopefully from a doorway. The central scene illustrates a tranquil, rolling Dorset landscape, reminiscent of Hardyâ€™s "Far from the Madding Crowd." A lone shepherd tends to his flock on a hillside, with a distant farmhouse nestled amongst green fields. The right side portrays a refined drawing-room interior, capturing the elegance of Austen's "Pride and Prejudice." A woman in a Regency-era gown sits at a writing desk, quill in hand, while other characters are subtly visible in the background, engaged in conversation. A pastel color palette dominates, with soft blues, greens, and creams. The composition should focus on clear, defined lines and realistic portrayals of the characters and environments, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements. The overall impression should be one of literary heritage and classic British storytelling, subtly reinforcing the idea of renowned authors.
