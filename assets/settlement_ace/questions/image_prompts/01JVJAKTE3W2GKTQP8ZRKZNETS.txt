A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting two distinct crosses laid upon a gently textured, parchment-toned background. The cross representing St. Andrew, the patron saint of Scotland, is a vibrant saltire, a diagonal white cross against a deep azure blue field, evoking the Scottish flag. Positioned adjacent to it, but clearly separate, is the cross representing St. Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland. This cross is depicted as a red saltire on a white field, its lines slightly thinner than St. Andrew's cross. Subtle watercolor washes create depth and texture, giving the impression of aged fabric or banners. Delicate shamrocks are scattered sparsely around the base of St. Patrick's cross, while thistles, the floral emblem of Scotland, rest near St. Andrew's cross. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with the azure and red softened to gentle hues. The composition is balanced, with both crosses occupying equal visual weight in the centre of the 16:9 ratio bounderies, symbolizing the equal representation of Ireland and Scotland within the Union Flag. The artistic style aims for clarity and elegance, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements, ensuring the image is both educational and visually appealing.
