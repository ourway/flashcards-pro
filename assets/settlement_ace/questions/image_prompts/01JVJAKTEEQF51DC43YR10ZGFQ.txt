A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic, watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The scene is split into two distinct but connected halves. The left half depicts a quaint, quintessential British village scene: rolling green hills dotted with sheep, a cozy pub with a smoking chimney, and terraced houses with blooming window boxes. In the center of this village scene, an MP, depicted as a friendly, approachable figure in a smart casual outfit, is engaged in conversation with a constituent holding a shopping bag. The MP is listening attentively, suggesting accessibility and community involvement. The right half of the image showcases the interior of the House of Commons, specifically a well-lit, traditionally furnished office. The same MP is seated at a desk, reviewing documents. Another constituent is seated opposite, also in conversation. A subtle, light blue line connects the MP in both scenes, visually linking their presence in the village and the House of Commons. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, with touches of red, white, and blue subtly integrated throughout the scene to evoke the UK flag without being overt. The overall composition emphasizes the MP's dual role: serving their constituents both within the formal setting of Parliament and within their local community. The art style should be highly detailed and realistic, avoiding cartoonish elements, to convey a sense of authenticity and trustworthiness.
