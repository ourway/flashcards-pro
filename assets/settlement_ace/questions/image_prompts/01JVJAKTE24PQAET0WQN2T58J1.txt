A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a pristine grass tennis court, meticulously rendered with individual blades of grass visible. On the court, two tennis rackets, one red and one blue, are crossed as if after a friendly match. Dominating the foreground is a classic Wimbledon scene: a partially eaten bowl of strawberries and cream. The strawberries are vibrant red, and the cream is a soft, inviting white, both colours subtly evoking the UK flag. Behind the tennis court, a gentle, rolling green hill leads to a stylized representation of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club's main building, its architecture subtly recognizable but not overly detailed. The sky above is a soft pastel blue with fluffy white clouds. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel hues, with occasional pops of red and blue to subtly represent the Union Jack. The style should emulate classic watercolour paintings, with soft edges and gentle gradients. The composition should be balanced and inviting, aiming to evoke a sense of calm, tradition, and the quintessential Wimbledon experience.
