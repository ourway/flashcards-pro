A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn image in a realistic style reminiscent of historical illustrations, using a pastel color palette with subtle reds, whites, and blues to echo the UK flag. The central focus is a Bronze Age artisan, depicted with weathered hands and a focused expression, hammering a glowing bronze sword on an anvil. Sparks fly upwards, illuminating his determined face and muscular arms. The sword itself is intricately detailed, showcasing the craftsmanship of the era. Around the artisan, various bronze tools and weapons are scattered – axes, shields, and spearheads – all reflecting the warm, metallic hues of bronze. In the background, slightly blurred and out of focus, is a collection of rough, unfinished pieces of glass – dull, opaque, and clearly inferior in quality and quantity to the bronze objects. These glass pieces are dusty, sitting on a simple wooden shelf, almost forgotten and untouched in a shadowy corner of the workshop. The lighting should emphasize the vibrant, polished bronze objects, contrasting sharply with the muted, dull glass. The scene should convey a clear sense of the Bronze Age artisan's mastery over metal, subtly implying their lack of expertise with glass. The overall composition should feel authentic and historically accurate, avoiding any modern elements or stylistic flourishes.
