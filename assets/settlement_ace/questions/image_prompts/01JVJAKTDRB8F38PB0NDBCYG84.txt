A watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a tranquil seascape under a pastel-colored sky, using predominantly blues and whites reminiscent of the UK flag. In the center, two distinct islands rise gently from the sea, bathed in soft, warm sunlight. The islands are lush and green, dotted with quaint, pastel-colored cottages and rolling hills. Each island is crowned with a miniature, ornate, golden crown, subtly alluding to their Crown dependency status. A small, traditional sailboat with white sails glides peacefully between the two islands, symbolizing connection yet separation. The overall composition should evoke a sense of serene independence and unique identity. The foreground features gentle waves lapping against a sandy shore, while the background fades into a hazy horizon. The scene should feel idyllic and somewhat isolated, emphasizing the islands' distinct position. The art style should be reminiscent of classic British landscape paintings, with a focus on capturing the natural beauty and charm of the coastal environment. The overall tone should be peaceful and educational, highlighting the unique status of these islands without explicitly stating it.
