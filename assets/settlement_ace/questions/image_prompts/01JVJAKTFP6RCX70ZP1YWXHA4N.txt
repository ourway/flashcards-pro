A watercolour illustration in a realistic style, capturing a scene symbolic of freedom of choice in marriage within the UK. The image should be in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is on two hands intertwined, subtly representing a marriage union. The hands are adorned with delicate, watercolour-style floral patterns in pastel shades of blue, pink, and cream, mimicking traditional British floral designs. One hand is gently releasing a flock of doves, each dove meticulously detailed with soft, feathered wings, symbolizing freedom and liberation. The doves ascend towards a light, airy sky, rendered in graduated pastel blues and whites. In the background, a faint outline of the Houses of Parliament can be seen, rendered in a soft, muted grey, signifying the UK's legal framework. A broken chain lies loosely at the base of the intertwined hands. The overall composition evokes a sense of peace, choice, and the protection offered by UK law. The colour palette should lean towards pastel tones, reminiscent of the UK flag's colours, creating a visually harmonious and memorable image. The style should be gentle and representational, avoiding harsh lines or overly dramatic elements.
