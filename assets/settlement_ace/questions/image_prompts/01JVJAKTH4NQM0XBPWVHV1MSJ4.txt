A hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting Henry VIII standing in a grand hall reminiscent of Hampton Court Palace. Henry VIII, rendered in a realistic style, is centrally positioned, his iconic Tudor attire meticulously detailed with gold embroidery and rich fabrics. He holds a document in his hand, seemingly proclaiming a decree. Behind him, a symbolic representation of the Church of Rome, depicted as a large, ornate cathedral with a cracked foundation, begins to visibly separate and tilt away from him. Rays of light, colored in soft gold and white, shine down upon Henry VIII, illuminating him as a central figure. The color palette leans towards pastel shades of red, white, and gold, mirroring the Tudor colors and subtly referencing the UK flag. On the right side, a simplified version of the English crown is visible. The overall composition aims for a balanced and educational aesthetic, focusing on clarity and visual symbolism to represent Henry VIII's break from the Church of Rome. The image should be detailed yet uncluttered, avoiding any text or numbers.
