A watercolour painting, 16:9 landscape, depicting a serene Polish countryside scene abruptly disrupted by symbolic elements of war. The central focus is a vast, golden wheat field under a pastel blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. In the foreground, stalks of wheat are slightly bent, as if disturbed by a recent, unseen force. A traditional Polish windmill, with its sails still turning gently, stands to the left of the frame, symbolizing Polish heritage and peaceful industry. Breaking the tranquility, a dark, ominous shadow in the shape of an Iron Cross (a German military symbol) stretches across a portion of the wheat field from the top right corner. The shadow doesn't completely darken the field but casts a noticeable pall, hinting at the impending darkness and oppression. Emerging from the edge of the shadow, subtle tracks resembling tank treads are visible in the wheat field, leading towards the windmill. The color palette is predominantly pastel, with the golden wheat contrasting with the blue sky. The shadow is the only element employing darker, muted tones, creating a visual juxtaposition of peace and impending conflict. The overall style should evoke a sense of loss of innocence and the disruption of a peaceful nation, providing a strong visual mnemonic for Poland's role as the country invaded in 1939, thus starting World War II.
