A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, showcasing a scene from Bronze Age Britain. The image is set against a backdrop of rolling green hills under a pastel blue sky, reminiscent of the British countryside. In the center, a skilled artisan, clad in simple, earthy-toned clothing, is hunched over a workbench crafting intricate bronze ornaments. To his left, a selection of finished ornaments gleam softly in the sunlight: delicate torques, armbands, and decorative pins. To his right, another artisan is diligently hammering a bronze sword into shape, sparks flying from the point of impact. Several finished bronze axes and spearheads are laid out beside him. The color palette is predominantly bronze (various shades of brown and gold), with accents of blue and red in the artisan's clothing, subtly referencing the UK flag. The composition emphasizes the duality of bronze craftsmanship: beauty and utility, adornment and defense. The lighting should be soft and diffused, highlighting the metallic sheen of the bronze objects. The overall mood is one of industriousness and creativity, capturing the essence of the Bronze Age innovations. The image should be strictly 2D, avoiding any 3D effects.
