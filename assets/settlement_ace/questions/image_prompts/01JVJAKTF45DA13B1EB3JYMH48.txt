A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a scene from the Crimean War, rendered in a pastel color palette dominated by blues, reds, and creams. The composition is centered on a makeshift field hospital tent, clearly marked with a red cross emblem, set against a backdrop of rolling, grassy hills reminiscent of the Crimean landscape. Inside the tent, a nurse resembling Florence Nightingale attends to wounded soldiers, their uniforms a muted blue and red. Outside the tent, a lone figure, a war correspondent with a notepad and pencil, is sketching the scene. He's dressed in civilian clothing, suggesting his role as an observer. In the foreground, a discarded newspaper lies partially open, a faint headline hinting at "War in Crimea." Symbolic elements include a quill pen resting on the newspaper, representing the power of the press, and a single, wilting poppy near the tent entrance, symbolizing remembrance. The sky is overcast, casting a somber mood over the scene. The overall art style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and the dawn of a new era in media coverage, emphasizing the raw realities of war being brought to the public's attention for the first time. The image should be 16:9 ratio and landscape orientation.
