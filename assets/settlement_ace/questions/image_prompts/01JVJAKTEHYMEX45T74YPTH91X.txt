A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic sports posters. The scene depicts two central figures: Jessica Ennis-Hill and Mo Farah, both radiating a golden aura. Jessica is captured mid-hurdle, showcasing her athletic prowess in the heptathlon, her form powerful and graceful, with the suggestion of the Olympic stadium track beneath her feet. Beside her, Mo Farah is in full stride, arms pumping as he runs, a determined look on his face, symbolizing his long-distance running achievements. Both athletes are adorned with stylized golden laurel wreaths, subtly hinting at their gold medals. The background features a soft-focus rendering of the London skyline with the iconic silhouette of the London Eye and the Shard. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, red, and white, echoing the colors of the Union Jack, with strategic use of gold to highlight the athletes and their achievements. The composition should convey energy, triumph, and the spirit of the 2012 London Olympics, creating a memorable visual association between the athletes, the event, and the golden victory.
