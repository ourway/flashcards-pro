A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic British landscape art. The scene is divided into two distinct but interconnected areas, each representing one of the castles. On the left side, a majestic, windswept hill crowned by Windsor Castle. The castle is depicted with accurate architectural details, its stone walls rendered in shades of grey and beige, and its towers reaching towards a pastel blue sky. A regal king with a red robe stands atop the castle, gazing out over his realm. The wind is visibly blowing his hair and robe, emphasizing the "wind" aspect of Windsor. On the right side, a swirling eddy of water flows around the base of Edinburgh Castle, which is perched on a rocky crag. The castle is similarly detailed, with its dark stone contrasting against the lighter sky. The water is rendered in shades of blue and green, with white foam highlighting the eddy. The two scenes are connected by a subtle, flowing line of mist, symbolizing the shared status of the castles. The overall color palette should be pastel, incorporating shades of blue, green, grey, and beige, with touches of red for the king's robe. The composition should be balanced, with both castles receiving equal visual weight. The art style should evoke a sense of history, grandeur, and the enduring power of the British monarchy.
