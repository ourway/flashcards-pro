A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a section of Hadrian's Wall snaking across a rolling, grassy landscape in northern England. The wall, constructed of grey stone blocks, should appear sturdy and imposing, yet weathered by time. On the southern side of the wall, Roman soldiers in traditional armor stand guard, their red cloaks billowing slightly in the wind. Their expressions are alert and watchful. To the north of the wall, suggesting the lands of the Picts, depict a misty, rugged terrain with sparse forests and rocky outcrops. A small group of Pict warriors, painted with traditional woad patterns in shades of blue, observe the wall from a distance. They should appear fierce and untamed, but also somewhat wary. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel blues, greens, and greys, reminiscent of the UK flag's hues, with the red of the Roman cloaks providing a striking contrast. The sky should be overcast, typical of the region, adding to the atmosphere of historical significance and the sense of a boundary between two distinct cultures. The composition should emphasize the wall as a clear division, with the Roman soldiers representing order and civilization, and the Picts embodying the wild, untamed lands beyond. The landscape should dominate the image, underscoring the vastness of the territory and the scale of the Roman endeavor. The image should capture the essence of Roman engineering prowess and the historical tension between the Roman Empire and the Pictish tribes.
