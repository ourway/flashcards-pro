A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a distinguished gentleman, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, seated at a writing desk in a late Victorian-era study. The study is filled with elements hinting at the Sherlock Holmes stories: a magnifying glass resting on a stack of papers, a deerstalker hat hanging on a coat rack, and a pipe emitting a swirl of smoke. The background features a bookshelf lined with leather-bound volumes, some subtly titled with anagrams of Sherlock Holmes story titles. The color palette leans towards muted blues, reds, and creams, reminiscent of the Union Jack, creating a sense of British heritage and history. Soft, diffused light streams in from a window, illuminating the scene and highlighting the intricate details of the author's face, capturing his intellectual and creative spirit. The composition is centered, drawing the viewer's eye to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the central figure and the answer to the question. The overall atmosphere should evoke a sense of mystery, intellect, and classic British literature.
