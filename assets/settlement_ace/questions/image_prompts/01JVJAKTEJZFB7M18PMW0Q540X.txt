A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style depicting a visual narrative of the validity of Northern Irish banknotes throughout the UK. The central focus is a hand gently placing a Northern Irish banknote (depicting a recognizable Northern Irish landmark, such as the Giant's Causeway or Belfast City Hall, without explicitly showing any denomination or text) onto a stylized map of the United Kingdom. The map is rendered in soft pastel shades of blue, pink, and white, subtly echoing the colours of the Union Jack, but in a muted and gentle way. The banknote is vibrant and stands out from the pastel background. The hand is drawn realistically, conveying a sense of trust and legitimacy. Radiating outward from the banknote and the UK map are subtle, shimmering wave-like patterns in light blues and whites, representing the widespread acceptance and validity. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, with a soft, diffused lighting effect that creates a sense of calm reassurance. The background is kept minimal to avoid distractions, with a very faint suggestion of rolling green hills, representative of the British countryside, rendered in the same pastel palette. The style should evoke classic British watercolour landscapes, emphasizing clarity and precision, while also maintaining a sense of warmth and accessibility. The image should feel informative and positive, subtly reinforcing the true statement without explicitly stating it.
