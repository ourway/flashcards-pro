A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a vibrant and symbolic scene related to the Welsh court system. The artwork is centered on a stylized, circular courtroom layout viewed from above, reminiscent of a soccer stadium. Twelve figures, each unique and representing a diverse cross-section of Welsh society, are positioned around the center, symbolizing the jury. Each juror wears a traditional Welsh woollen hat, but in pastel colours of blue, red and white. The central area features a scale of justice delicately balanced. Around the courtroom, subtle depictions of Welsh landmarks, such as Snowdonia mountains and Caernarfon Castle, are painted in soft watercolor tones. The colour palette consists primarily of pastel shades of red, white, and blue, subtly referencing the Union Jack, interspersed with earthy tones reflecting the Welsh landscape. The overall style is detailed and realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, aiming to create a visually engaging and memorable mnemonic for the number twelve and its association with a jury in Wales. The goal is to evoke a sense of justice, community, and Welsh identity.
