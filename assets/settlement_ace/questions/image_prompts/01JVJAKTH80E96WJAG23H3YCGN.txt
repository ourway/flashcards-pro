A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic watercolor style, depicting a grand, stylized cross-section of the UK Parliament building. The composition is divided vertically into two distinct chambers, each representing one of the houses of Parliament. On the left, representing the House of Lords, visualize a chamber adorned with deep red hues, ornate gold detailing, and plush velvet seating. The figures within are dressed in traditional parliamentary robes, suggesting a sense of history and inherited privilege. On the right, representing the House of Commons, the chamber is depicted in shades of green, with simpler wooden benches and a more crowded, active atmosphere. The figures here are dressed in contemporary business attire, reflecting a broader representation of the population. A stylized, symbolic bridge connects the two chambers at the top, representing the legislative process and the interaction between the two houses. The bridge is coloured in light blue, resembling the sky. The overall color palette should lean towards the pastel colours, with subtle hints of the UK flag's red, white, and blue incorporated thoughtfully into the architectural details and the figures' attire. The image should evoke a sense of historical significance and the dynamic interplay of tradition and modernity within the UK's political system.
