A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting a symbolic tetrapod to represent the United Kingdom. The tetrapod stands gracefully on a lush, green field, its four limbs distinctly marked with the flags of England (St. George's Cross), Scotland (St. Andrew's Saltire), Wales (the Welsh Dragon), and Northern Ireland (St. Patrick's Saltire). Each limb seamlessly transitions from the flag pattern into a realistic depiction of the respective country's landscape: rolling hills for England, majestic mountains for Scotland, verdant valleys for Wales, and a serene coastline for Northern Ireland. The body of the tetrapod is a collage of iconic British symbols â€“ a silhouette of Big Ben, a double-decker bus, and a teapot, all rendered in a pastel blue hue. To the left of the tetrapod, at a slight distance, lies a separate landmass, colored in a muted green, symbolizing Ireland. This landmass is visually disconnected from the tetrapod, emphasizing its exclusion from the UK. The overall color palette should be dominated by pastel shades of blue, green, and red, reminiscent of the UK flag, creating a harmonious and educational visual. The background should feature a softly painted sky with fluffy white clouds, completing the serene and memorable scene.
