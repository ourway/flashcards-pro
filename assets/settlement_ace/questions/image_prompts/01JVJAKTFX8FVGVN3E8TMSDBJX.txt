A watercolour painting in a realistic style, depicting the Palace of Westminster at twilight. The sky is a deep indigo, transitioning to a soft pastel blue near the horizon. Silhouettes of the Houses of Parliament stand against this backdrop. In the foreground, a long, ornate table is situated, reminiscent of a parliamentary setting. On one side of the table, bathed in warm, golden light emanating from unseen chandeliers, sit several figures representing government ministers. They are depicted in rich, saturated colours - deep blues, reds, and golds. On the opposite side of the table, shrouded in a soft, semi-transparent, greyish-blue "shadow," are the 'Shadow Ministers'. These figures are subtly less defined, their colours muted and pastel, as if partially obscured. Each shadow minister is positioned directly opposite their governmental counterpart, mirroring their posture and general appearance. The overall composition suggests a direct, albeit spectral, opposition. The entire scene should evoke a sense of serious debate and the duality of governance and opposition, rendered with delicate brushstrokes and a focus on light and shadow to emphasize the “shadow” aspect. The colour palette should lean towards pastel hues, with strategic use of darker, more saturated colours to create contrast and visual interest.
