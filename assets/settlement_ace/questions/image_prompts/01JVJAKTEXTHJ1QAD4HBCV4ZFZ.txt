A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a lone wolf standing atop a windswept, grassy hill in the Scottish Highlands. The wolf, rendered in shades of grey and white, possesses piercing blue eyes that convey independence and self-reliance. The sky above is a patchwork of soft pastel blues and whites, suggesting a clear, crisp day. The rolling hills are colored in muted greens and browns, dotted with patches of heather in bloom, adding a touch of purple to the landscape. In the far distance, silhouetted against the horizon, stand the faint outlines of the Houses of Parliament, subtly hinting at the political context. The wolf is positioned slightly off-center, facing towards the viewer, its stance proud and unwavering. The overall composition evokes a sense of solitude, strength, and freedom, mirroring the concept of an independent individual standing apart from a larger group. The colors should resemble the UK flag or be in a pastel color palette. The image ratio should be 16:9 and landscape orientation. The main subject and idea should be mainly in the center of the image (16:9 ratio bounderies).
