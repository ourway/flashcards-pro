A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting six distinct, regal female figures representing the wives of King Henry VIII. The figures are arranged in a horizontal line across the 16:9 canvas, each identifiable by subtle variations in their attire and posture, all drawn using a pastel colour palette. The three figures representing the Catherines are grouped together towards the left-center, each adorned with progressively elaborate headwear, subtly hinting at their individual stories. A soft, diffused light shines upon them, highlighting their shared name. To the right, separated slightly from the Catherines, are the two Annes, also distinguished by unique gowns and hairstyles but bearing a common thread in their elegant bearing. The sixth wife stands slightly apart on the right, with a different style of dress and expression, making her stand out from the rest. A faint, almost ethereal, Tudor rose pattern is subtly integrated into the background, adding depth and context without overpowering the central figures. The overall composition aims for a balanced and harmonious aesthetic, designed to aid memorization through visual association and the subtle repetition of key figures. The colour palette is predominantly pastel, dominated by soft blues, pinks, and creams, providing a calming yet informative visual experience.
