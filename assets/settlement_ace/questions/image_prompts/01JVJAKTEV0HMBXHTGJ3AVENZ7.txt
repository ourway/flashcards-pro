A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, adhering to a 16:9 landscape ratio. The color palette should predominantly feature pastel colors, with subtle hints of red, white, and blue reminiscent of the UK flag. The central focus is a Roman chariot race taking place in an ancient British setting. Imagine a grassy field, bordered by a simple wooden fence, acting as an early racetrack. Two Roman chariots, each pulled by a pair of powerful, muscular horses, are neck and neck, kicking up dust as they thunder towards the finish line. The charioteers, clad in simple Roman tunics, are focused and determined, reins tightly in hand. In the background, a gentle rolling hill dotted with ancient Celtic roundhouses provides a sense of place and time. A small group of Celtic onlookers, dressed in simple woven clothing, observe the race with curiosity and wonder. The sky is a soft pastel blue with fluffy white clouds, lending a sense of tranquility to the scene despite the energetic race. The overall composition should evoke a sense of history and the ancient roots of horse racing in Britain, seamlessly merging Roman elements with the British landscape. Avoid any text or numbers. The image style should be reminiscent of classical historical illustrations, with attention to detail and accuracy in the depiction of Roman chariots, horses, and Celtic settlements.
