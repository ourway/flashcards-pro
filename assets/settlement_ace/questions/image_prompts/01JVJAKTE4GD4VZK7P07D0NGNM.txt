A meticulously detailed, realistic watercolor painting depicting a cyclist, Bradley Wiggins, in the iconic yellow jersey of the Tour de France leader. The cyclist is positioned centrally, riding uphill on a winding French country road, lined with lavender fields in full bloom. The cyclist wears a distinctive sideburn and a retro-style cycling helmet. The background features rolling hills and a glimpse of a distant, quaint French village with terracotta rooftops. A stylized British flag is subtly incorporated into the scene: the cyclist's jersey has thin red and blue stripes running along the sleeves, reminiscent of the Union Jack. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with soft blues, lavenders, and yellows dominating the landscape. The cyclist's movement is suggested by blurred wheels and a slight distortion of the background, conveying speed and determination. The sun is setting in the distance, casting a warm golden glow over the scene, highlighting the cyclist's focused expression. The art style should evoke a sense of nostalgia and classic sporting achievement.
