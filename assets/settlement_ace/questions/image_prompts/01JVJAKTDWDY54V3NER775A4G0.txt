A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style depicting Saint George slaying a dragon. Saint George, clad in shining silver armour with a prominent red cross emblazoned on his white tunic and shield, is astride a majestic white horse. The horse is rearing up, its muscles taut with energy. Below them, a fearsome, green dragon writhes in agony, impaled by Saint George's lance. The background features a rolling English countryside of lush green fields dotted with blooming spring flowers, mainly daffodils and roses, in pastel colours. A quaint village with thatched-roof cottages is nestled in the distance, suggesting the people Saint George is protecting. Above, the sky is a clear, pastel blue, punctuated by fluffy white clouds that resemble lambs. The overall composition is dynamic and heroic, centring on the battle between good and evil. The colour palette primarily uses shades of red (cross, blood), white (horse, tunic), green (dragon, fields), and blue (sky) to subtly evoke the colours of the UK flag, while also incorporating pastel tones to create a gentle, memorable image. Light should be soft and diffused, giving the scene a peaceful yet powerful aura. The image should focus on the Saint George and the dragon in the center, with the background elements enhancing the sense of English identity and springtime celebration.
