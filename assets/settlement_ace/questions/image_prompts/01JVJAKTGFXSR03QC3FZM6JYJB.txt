A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style (not cartoonish or abstract) depicting Queen Elizabeth II in her coronation regalia. She is seated on a throne with intricate carvings of British flora and fauna. The throne room is bathed in soft, diffused light, highlighting the Queen's serene expression. She wears St Edward's Crown, rendered with meticulous detail, and holds the Sceptre with the Cross. A flowing, deep-blue velvet cape drapes behind her, embroidered with golden lions and Tudor roses. The background consists of a subtly suggested stained-glass window featuring the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom. Emerging from the top of the crown is a cascade of doves, each carrying a tiny, stylized banner bearing a single letter that, when combined, spells out "Noble." The doves are rendered in shades of white and grey, creating a sense of purity and grace. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with hints of red and blue subtly referencing the UK flag. The composition is centered on the Queen, emphasizing her regal presence and the association with the keyword "Noble," visually linking her status to the answer. The image aims to evoke a sense of respect, history, and the enduring nature of the monarchy.
