A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, showcasing the Houses of Parliament and St Pancras Station side-by-side. The Houses of Parliament should be depicted on the left, its iconic clock tower (Big Ben) prominently visible, with intricate details of its Gothic architecture, including pointed arches, ornate windows, and spires reaching towards a pastel blue sky. The color palette should lean towards shades of grey stone, accented with touches of gold leaf detailing on the clock face and architectural highlights, subtly incorporating the UK flag's colors.

On the right, St Pancras Station should be illustrated, capturing its grand Victorian Gothic facade. Focus on the red brickwork, the elaborate arched windows, and the soaring clock tower that mirrors the Houses of Parliament in style but distinguishes itself with unique architectural features. Soft, diffused light should filter through the arched windows, creating a warm, inviting glow. The sky above St Pancras should be a slightly warmer shade of pastel blue, complementing the red brick.

The composition should emphasize the shared Gothic Revival style of both buildings, using subtle lines and shading to create depth and realism. The entire image should be framed within a 16:9 ratio, with the main focus on the central structures, allowing the architectural details to be the primary visual cue for remembering the answer. The color palette should be predominantly pastel, with red, white, and blue tones subtly integrated to reflect the UK flag, enhancing the visual connection to the UK's cultural heritage.
