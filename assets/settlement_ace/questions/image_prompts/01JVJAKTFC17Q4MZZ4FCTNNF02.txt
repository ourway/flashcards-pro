A hand-drawn, realistic 2D illustration in a watercolour style, depicting a majestic Scottish thistle, the national flower of Scotland, positioned prominently in the center of the 16:9 landscape. The thistle's vibrant purple blooms are in full view, with intricate details showcasing its delicate petals and thorny leaves. Behind the thistle, subtly rendered in muted pastel blues and greys, is a stylized representation of the Palace of Westminster in London, its iconic clock tower softly visible. Overlapping the thistle and the background of the Palace of Westminster is a translucent, slightly blurred shield in the colors of the Union Jack (red, white, and blue). This shield partially obscures the Palace of Westminster, signifying the UK government's overarching authority in specific areas. The overall composition suggests a sense of shared governance, with Scotland having its own distinct identity (the thistle) and legislative power, but also being part of a larger union where certain powers are reserved (the shield overlapping the parliament building). The colour palette leans towards pastel shades, with the purple of the thistle and the blues/reds of the shield standing out gently, creating a visually harmonious and memorable image.
