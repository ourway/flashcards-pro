A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting Mo Farah mid-stride during a 10,000-meter race. He is wearing a British running kit, the colors predominantly red, white, and blue, subtly blending into a pastel color palette. The background features a stylized Olympic stadium rendered in soft pastel blues and creams, with abstract representations of cheering crowds as blurred, colorful shapes. Focus the composition on Mo Farah in the center of the image, his face showing determination and focus. Around him, golden light emanates, subtly highlighting his figure and creating a sense of triumph. Small, stylized golden laurel wreaths float around him, symbolizing victory. His feet should be slightly elevated, showing him in full athletic motion. The track beneath his feet is a muted grey, providing contrast. The overall impression should be one of athletic prowess, national pride, and the glory of achieving a historic Olympic victory. The sky above the stadium should be a soft, gradient blend of pastel blues and pinks, suggesting a dawn or dusk setting.
