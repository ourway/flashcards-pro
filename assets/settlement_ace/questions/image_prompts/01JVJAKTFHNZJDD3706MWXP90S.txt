A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic watercolor illustrations, showcasing two distinct scenes united within a single 16:9 landscape composition. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the UK flag.

On the left half of the image, depict the exterior of a traditional British police station. The building should be rendered with architectural accuracy, featuring classic brickwork, prominent signage, and perhaps a constable in traditional uniform standing guard near the entrance, looking professional and approachable. A person is walking towards the station's entrance, holding a file folder, their expression conveying a determined purpose.

The right half of the image shows a stately office interior. A large wooden desk dominates the scene, behind which sits a figure representing the "Chief Constable." This figure should be depicted as a person of authority and respect. On the desk, a neatly arranged stack of papers is visible, with one letter prominently displayed at the top. A quill and inkwell are placed beside the letter, suggesting the tradition of written correspondence. A magnifying glass rests on top of the letter, suggesting attention to detail.

A soft, diffused light should illuminate the entire scene, creating a sense of clarity and transparency. The composition should be balanced, with clear visual cues connecting the two halves, illustrating the two avenues for lodging a complaint: in person at the police station and in writing to the Chief Constable. The overall style should evoke a sense of trust, order, and due process, emphasizing the accessibility and accountability of the police force. No text is allowed in the image.
