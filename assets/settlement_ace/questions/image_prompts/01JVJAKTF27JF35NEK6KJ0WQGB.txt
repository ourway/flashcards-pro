A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a split composition. On the left, a cozy Christmas scene unfolds, dominated by a decorated Christmas tree adorned with traditional ornaments, twinkling lights, and a shining star on top. Beneath the tree, wrapped presents in red and green paper are scattered. A warm fireplace glows softly in the background, casting a gentle light on the scene. The colors are rich and vibrant, primarily reds, greens, and golds, evoking the festive spirit of Christmas. On the right side of the composition, a New Year's Eve scene is depicted. A large, ornate clock strikes midnight, signaling the start of the New Year. Fireworks explode in the night sky, illuminating silhouettes of joyful people celebrating with champagne glasses raised in a toast. The color palette shifts to cooler tones of blues, silvers, and purples, reflecting the crisp winter air and the excitement of the New Year. A subtle, snow-covered landscape connects both scenes at the bottom of the frame, symbolizing the transition between the two holidays. The overall mood is celebratory yet clearly distinguishes the separate timing of Christmas and New Year. The style should be reminiscent of classic holiday cards, aiming for a nostalgic and easily recognizable aesthetic.
