A hand-drawn, realistic 2D landscape depicting the British countryside, divided into distinct layers representing the passage of time. The base layer, closest to the viewer, showcases a vibrant scene of Roman life: a meticulously constructed Roman road cutting through rolling green hills, a bathhouse with figures in togas relaxing and conversing, and a villa with classic Roman architecture. Figures in Roman attire are actively engaged in daily life. Rising above this vibrant Roman layer is a mist, gently obscuring the Roman scene as it transitions into a medieval landscape. This middle ground shows early medieval villages and structures gradually replacing the Roman influence. The uppermost layer, representing modern Britain, features a patchwork of fields, quaint villages with distinct British architecture (stone houses with slate roofs), and hints of modern infrastructure like winding country lanes and church spires. Subtle color changes should indicate the shift in eras, with the Roman layer employing warm, earthy tones (ochre, terracotta), the medieval layer using muted greens and browns, and the modern layer incorporating the vibrant greens and blues of the British landscape. The overall color palette should lean towards the pastel side, with the Roman part being in the British flag colours. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of historical depth and continuity, emphasizing the long-lasting influence of the Roman period gradually fading into the fabric of British history. The image ratio is 16:9.
