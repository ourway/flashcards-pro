A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a lush Welsh landscape under a clear, pastel-blue sky. Rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep fade into distant, mist-shrouded mountains. In the foreground, centered, a majestic red dragon, inspired by the Welsh flag, stands proudly on a small rocky outcrop. The dragon is not aggressive, but noble and serene, with intricate scales rendered in shades of red and gold. Around the base of the outcrop, daffodils, the national flower of Wales, bloom profusely in shades of yellow and white. A small, winding stream meanders through the foreground, reflecting the sky and the surrounding greenery. In the far distance, barely visible through the mist, are the faint outlines of ancient stone ruins, suggesting the rich history of the land. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with accents of the red and gold of the dragon, creating a sense of tranquility and timelessness while still holding a visual connection to the Welsh flag. The composition leads the eye to the central figure of the dragon, subtly connecting it to the landscape and national symbols of Wales. The image should evoke a sense of Welsh pride and heritage.
