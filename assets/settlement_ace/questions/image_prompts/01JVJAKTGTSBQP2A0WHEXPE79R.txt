A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic style, resembling a historical watercolor painting. The scene depicts King John seated at a large, ornate wooden table in a medieval setting. He is dressed in royal robes of deep crimson and gold, looking somewhat disgruntled. On the table, a large parchment scroll, representing the Magna Carta, is prominently displayed, partially unrolled to reveal elegant, hand-written script. A quill and inkwell sit beside it. The king's hand is hovering hesitantly above the document, as if contemplating signing it. Behind the king, a diverse group of barons and commoners stand, observing the scene with expressions of solemn determination and hope. The backdrop features a large stained-glass window depicting a symbolic representation of justice: scales balanced equally. Sunlight streams through the window, casting a warm, golden glow on the scene. The colors are primarily pastel shades, with highlights of red, blue, and gold, reminiscent of the UK flag. The overall composition is balanced, with the Magna Carta and the king at the center, drawing the viewer's attention to the core subject matter. The atmosphere should evoke a sense of historical significance and the triumph of law over absolute power.
