A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a classic English cricket scene interrupted by a sudden downpour. The central focus is a cricket pitch, rendered in lush green hues, with meticulously detailed blades of grass. Cricket stumps stand prominently at both ends, slightly blurred by the rain. Two cricket players, dressed in traditional white uniforms, are caught mid-action; one is batting, poised with his bat raised, and the other is fielding, with a surprised expression as he looks up at the sky. Heavy rain is falling, depicted with varying shades of grey and blue, creating a sense of dramatic pause. The background features a quintessential English countryside scene â€“ rolling green hills dotted with sheep, a quaint village with stone houses and a church spire in the distance, all softened and muted by the rain. Above the scene, dark, ominous rain clouds fill the sky, painted in deep greys and blues, contrasting with the predominantly pastel colour palette used throughout the image. The overall atmosphere is one of stillness and anticipation, capturing the moment "rain stopped play." The color palette should primarily consist of pastel shades of blue, green, and grey, subtly incorporating hints of red to subtly allude to the UK flag without being overt.
