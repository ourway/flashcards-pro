A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting Crathes Castle in Scotland. The castle should be centrally positioned within the 16:9 landscape frame, showcasing its distinctive Scottish Baronial architecture. The castle's pinkish-grey stone walls should be rendered with careful attention to texture and detail, emphasizing its historical character. The surrounding landscape should feature rolling green hills characteristic of the Scottish Highlands, dotted with heather in bloom, using pastel purples and greens. A serene loch should be visible in the foreground, reflecting the castle and sky, rendered in shades of blue and grey. The sky above should be a soft, overcast grey-blue, typical of Scottish weather. Include details like the castle's turrets, crow-stepped gables, and multiple windows. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades with accents of the UK flag's colors (red, white, and blue) subtly integrated into the surrounding flora. The painting style should evoke a sense of history, tranquility, and the unique beauty of the Scottish landscape, creating a memorable visual association with Crathes Castle.
