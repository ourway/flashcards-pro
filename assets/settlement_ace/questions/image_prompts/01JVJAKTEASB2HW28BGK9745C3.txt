A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting two distinct scenes representative of Sir Alfred Hitchcock and Ridley Scott's filmographies. The image is framed in a 16:9 landscape ratio, with each scene occupying roughly half the canvas. On the left, a suspenseful scene inspired by Hitchcock: A lone, vintage street lamp casts long shadows on a cobblestone street, illuminating a mysterious figure with an umbrella lurking near a classic British telephone box. A flock of birds is taking flight in a panic. On the right, a scene evoking Ridley Scott: A futuristic cityscape with sleek, silver skyscrapers piercing a cloudy, pastel-colored sky. A lone, futuristic vehicle hovers between the buildings, suggesting advanced technology and a sense of dystopia. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, grays, and whites, with subtle accents of red in the telephone box and the futuristic vehicle, subtly alluding to the Union Jack colors. The composition should be balanced, with the street lamp and the tallest skyscraper serving as vertical anchors. The style should feel reminiscent of classic movie posters, with a focus on atmosphere and subtle storytelling.
