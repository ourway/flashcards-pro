A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style with a 16:9 aspect ratio, set against a backdrop of pastel blue skies reminiscent of a calm London morning. The focal point is divided into two distinct but connected scenes. On the left, a classic British police station with a traditional blue lamp hanging above the entrance. A smartly dressed individual, holding a file folder (symbolizing a complaint), is depicted walking towards the entrance. The station's architecture should have a vintage feel, constructed of red bricks. On the right, a quill rests elegantly on a desk beside a neatly stacked pile of parchment. In the background, behind the desk, is a silhouette of a stately figure gazing out of a window, representing the Chief Constable in his office. The desk should be made of dark wood, with an inkwell and a blotter visible. A faint, connecting line, like a wisp of smoke, visually links the person approaching the police station to the quill and parchment on the desk, symbolizing the act of lodging a complaint through both physical presence and written communication. The color palette should primarily feature pastel blues, reds, and creams, creating a calming and informative visual. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of order, justice, and the proper channels for addressing grievances within the British legal system.
