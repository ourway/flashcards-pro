A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the Houses of Parliament, focusing on the House of Lords. The color palette should be predominantly pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly echoing the UK flag. The composition is centered on the ornate, red-benched chamber of the House of Lords. Dominating the foreground is a stylized, symbolic representation of a hereditary peer: a regal, elderly figure in traditional robes and a coronet, seated firmly on a bench. The figure exudes an air of established right and privilege. Behind him, slightly blurred but still discernible, are other peers in similar attire. The scene should convey a sense of history, tradition, and continuity. Instead of showing any removal or change, emphasize the presence and permanence of the hereditary peer. Light should stream in through the high, arched windows, illuminating the scene and highlighting the rich details of the architecture and the peers' attire. The overall impression should be one of stability and unchanged status, visually reinforcing the idea that the Reform Act did not remove the automatic right of hereditary peers to attend the House of Lords. The artwork must avoid any cartoonish or abstract elements, maintaining a realistic and dignified portrayal of the subject.
