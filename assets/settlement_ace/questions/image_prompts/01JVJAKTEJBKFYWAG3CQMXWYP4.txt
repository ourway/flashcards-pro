A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic scientific illustrations with a pastel colour palette. The image is divided into two distinct but connected halves. On the left, a portrait of Tim Berners-Lee, depicted as a young, thoughtful man with a gentle smile, faces the viewer. Behind him, subtle interconnected nodes and lines represent the early internet, resembling a delicate neural network that fades into a soft blue background. The nodes are slightly illuminated, giving a sense of innovation and discovery. On the right, a portrait of Alan Turing, also depicted as a young, intelligent man, gazes intently. Behind him, an Enigma machine is subtly suggested through abstracted shapes and shadows, coloured in shades of grey and pastel blue. The Enigma machine shapes are not fully formed but hint at complexity and codebreaking. A faint, almost ethereal, representation of the British flag is subtly woven into the background, with pastel red and blue hues blending softly. A thin, stylized line visually connects the two portraits, symbolizing their combined impact on the 20th century and beyond, suggesting knowledge transfer and a shared legacy of innovation. The overall composition should be balanced and harmonious, evoking a sense of intellectual achievement and historical significance. The art style should be detailed and realistic but not overly photographic, giving it a timeless quality suitable for educational purposes.
