A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour painting depicting a serene scene in a British park, rendered in a pastel colour palette dominated by blues, reds and whites. The central focus is a single, majestic oak tree, its branches reaching towards the sky. At the base of the tree, nestled amongst the grass and wildflowers, is a single, intricately detailed Khalsa Kirpan (ceremonial dagger), symbolizing Sikhism. The Kirpan is depicted with a polished steel blade and a handle adorned with delicate gold filigree. The surrounding wildflowers are primarily white daisies and red poppies, scattered sparsely to emphasize the "one" concept. The overall composition is designed to evoke a sense of peace and contemplation, drawing the viewer's eye to the single Kirpan at the base of the mighty oak. The background features a soft, hazy landscape with rolling green hills fading into a light blue sky. The art style should be reminiscent of classic British landscape painting, with a focus on capturing the subtle nuances of light and shadow. The overall feeling should be one of understated elegance and respect, subtly highlighting the presence of the Sikh community within the broader British landscape. The single Kirpan at the base of the tree, surrounded by a sea of green and dotted with a few white and red flowers, symbolizes the 1% statistic, creating a strong visual association for the viewer.
