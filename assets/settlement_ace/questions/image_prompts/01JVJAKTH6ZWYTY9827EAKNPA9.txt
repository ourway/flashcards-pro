A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a serene, early morning coastal scene in Dorset, England. The scene is bathed in the soft, pastel hues of dawn, primarily blues, pinks, and whites, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag. In the center, a single, long, wooden Viking longship, its prow carved with a dragon's head, is cautiously approaching the shore. The ship is not overtly menacing but rather appears exploratory. On the shore, three bewildered-looking sheep are arranged in a line from left to right, subtly decreasing in size to imply depth and arranged to resemble the numbers '7', '8', and '9'. The sheep are colored in shades of white, light grey and cream. The landscape should feature rolling green hills typical of Dorset, dotted with quaint thatched-roof cottages in the distance. The water in the foreground is calm, reflecting the pastel sky, but with slight ripples indicating movement. The overall composition should evoke a sense of historical quietude, emphasizing the unexpected nature of the Viking arrival rather than a violent invasion. The artistic style should emulate the detailed realism of 19th-century landscape paintings, with a focus on capturing the natural light and textures of the scene.
