A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a pastel colour palette (primarily blues, reds, and whites) depicting Queen Elizabeth I standing on a cliff overlooking the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. The cliff is part of the white cliffs of Dover, subtly implied with layers of off-white and light grey. Queen Elizabeth I is in the center, wearing an elaborate red and gold dress, but her expression is serene and confident, not triumphant or aggressive. She holds a telescope lightly in her right hand, gazing at the naval battle occurring in the sea below. The sea is rendered in varying shades of blue, from light pastel blue near the horizon to a deeper, richer blue closer to the foreground. The English ships, smaller but more agile, are depicted engaging the larger Spanish galleons. Smoke from cannons rises in the air, creating a hazy, atmospheric effect. The sun, a soft golden orb, peeks through the clouds, casting a warm glow on the scene. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peace and national pride, emphasizing Queen Elizabeth I's leadership and the significance of the Armada's defeat. The art style should be reminiscent of historical paintings, with attention to detail in the clothing, ships, and landscape. The image should be highly detailed and realistic, but with a gentle, pastel color scheme to create a memorable and educational visual.
