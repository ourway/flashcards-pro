A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the symbolic joining of England and Scotland in 1707 through the Act of Union. The artwork should feature two prominent, stylized national flowers: the English rose and the Scottish thistle. The rose, rendered in soft pastel pinks and greens, gracefully intertwines with the thistle, depicted in gentle purples and greens. They should not be merged into one flower, but they should be very close together. The background should fade from a light blue on the left side of the image into a light red on the right side, resembling the colours of the UK flag. A delicate, flowing ribbon of light cream colour unites the two flowers at their stems, symbolizing the Act of Union. The ribbon should appear aged and textured, like parchment. Behind the rose and thistle, a faint outline of the British Isles should be visible, rendered in a soft, muted grey. The overall composition should be centered, with the intertwined flowers as the focal point, conveying a sense of peace, unity, and historical significance. The image should be in a 16:9 landscape format.
