A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic, historical illustration style, reminiscent of a page from an illuminated manuscript. The colour palette leans heavily on pastel shades of red, white, and blue, subtly echoing the Union Jack. The central focus is a regal, ornate throne, slightly tarnished as if recently recovered from disuse. Seated on the throne is not a religious figure but a figure of King Charles II, dressed in royal attire but with a slightly bewildered expression. He holds a royal scepter in one hand. Behind the throne, partially obscured by shadows, are faint, almost ghostly images of religious iconography associated with Roman Catholicism â€“ a papal mitre, a crucifix, and a stained-glass window design. These are faded and indistinct, conveying their lack of prominence during the Restoration. In the foreground, a group of joyful commoners wave flags and cheer, directing their attention towards the king, and not towards the faded religious symbols. The overall composition suggests a shift in power and focus from religious authority to the monarchy, emphasizing the secular nature of The Restoration.
