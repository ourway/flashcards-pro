A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a dramatic scene on the English Channel. The central focus is a large, stylized Spanish galleon, its sails emblazoned with a subtle, faded emblem hinting at the Spanish crown. The galleon is rendered in warm, earthy tones of ochre, burnt sienna, and deep red, reminiscent of the Spanish flag. The ship is sailing towards the right side of the image, implying a forceful advance. In the foreground, a smaller English ship, colored in cool blues and whites, maneuvers defensively. The sea is a turbulent mix of blues and greens, with whitecaps suggesting a storm. Above, storm clouds gather, mirroring the tension of the historical event. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, creating a visually appealing and educational image. The composition emphasizes the size and power of the Spanish fleet. The sun is hidden behind the clouds, casting a dramatic light on the scene. The sky should have a watercolour effect with light blue and grey tones. The image should be 16:9 ratio.
