A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, depicting a close-up of a bowl overflowing with ripe, vibrant red strawberries, each glistening with tiny droplets of condensation. Nestled amongst the strawberries are dollops of thick, clotted cream, artfully swirled to suggest movement and freshness. The bowl itself is classic white porcelain with a delicate, subtly embossed Wimbledon-green rim. The background is soft-focused, suggesting the lush green of a perfectly manicured lawn of the Wimbledon tennis courts. The composition is centered, with the bowl of strawberries and cream being the primary focus. The color palette should be predominantly pastel, with the bright red of the strawberries contrasting against the creamy white and subtle green accents. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. A single, stray blade of Wimbledon grass rests delicately on the rim of the bowl, emphasizing the connection to the famous tennis tournament. The overall impression is one of quintessential British summer, indulgence, and tradition, designed to evoke a strong association with Wimbledon and its iconic strawberries and cream.
