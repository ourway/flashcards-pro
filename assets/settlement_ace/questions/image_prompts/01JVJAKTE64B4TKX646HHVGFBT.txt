A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Sir Francis Drake's ship, the *Golden Hind*, circumnavigating the globe while simultaneously engaging the Spanish Armada. The *Golden Hind* should be the central focus, rendered with high detail, showcasing its sails billowing in the wind and its sturdy wooden construction. The ship should be sailing from left to right. The lower half of the image should transition from the cold, icy blue waters of the Antarctic (representing the circumnavigation) on the left, gradually warming to the turquoise waters of the Caribbean towards the center, and finally the dark blue of the English channel on the right. Miniature depictions of landmarks the ship passed should be visible along the horizon line: South American mountains, Polynesian islands, and the African coastline. Above the *Golden Hind*, a stylized representation of the Spanish Armada should be visible on the right, depicted as a fleet of imposing galleons with red and gold sails (representing the Spanish flag), firing cannons towards the *Golden Hind*. The sky should be a dynamic mix of stormy grey clouds near the Armada, gradually clearing to a bright, sunny blue above the *Golden Hind*, symbolizing Drake's triumph. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and golds, reminiscent of historical maritime paintings, with a touch of dramatic lighting to highlight the *Golden Hind* and the Armada. No text should be visible in the image.
