A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, resembling a watercolor painting. The artwork, in a 16:9 landscape ratio, visualizes King Alfred the Great leading a united Anglo-Saxon army against Viking invaders. King Alfred, depicted as a strong, determined leader with a flowing cloak reminiscent of the red in the UK flag, stands in the center, holding a battle standard adorned with a golden dragon, symbolizing Anglo-Saxon power. The Anglo-Saxon soldiers behind him, in hues of blue and white echoing the UK flag, are a mix of shield-bearing infantry and archers, their faces determined. In the foreground, scattered Viking helmets and broken weapons suggest a recent victory. The background showcases a rolling English countryside with a fortified village on a distant hill, painted in pastel greens and browns. A longship, a Viking vessel, burns on a nearby river, sending a plume of dark smoke into the sky. The overall composition emphasizes unity and resilience, visually representing King Alfred's role in uniting the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and successfully defending against Viking invasions. The art style should evoke historical tapestries or illuminated manuscripts.
