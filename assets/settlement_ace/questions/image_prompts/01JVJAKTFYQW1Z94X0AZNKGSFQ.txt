A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor painting, ratio 16:9, displaying the Houses of Parliament and the Tower of London, bathed in the soft, pastel hues of a sunrise. The Houses of Parliament occupy the left side of the frame, rendered with detailed architectural accuracy; the iconic clock tower of Big Ben is prominently featured. The colour palette should be pastel blue, light pink and white to resemble the UK flag. The Tower of London stands on the right, its ancient stone walls rendered with a texture that evokes centuries of history. Connecting the two landmarks is a winding, cobblestone road, subtly suggesting the passage of time. Along the road, small, almost ethereal figures in period clothing – knights, Victorian ladies, and other historical figures – are faintly sketched, representing British history and traditions. The sky above is a gentle gradient of pastel colours, with soft, diffused light illuminating the scene. The River Thames flows gently in the foreground, reflecting the colours of the sky and the buildings, adding depth and serenity to the image. The overall composition should convey a sense of timelessness, stability, and the deep-rooted history that underpins British institutions and values. The style should evoke classic British landscape paintings, emphasizing realism and historical accuracy while maintaining a soft, educational aesthetic.
