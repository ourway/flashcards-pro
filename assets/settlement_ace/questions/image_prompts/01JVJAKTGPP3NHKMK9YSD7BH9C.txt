A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a medieval European village scene under a pall of dark, ominous clouds. The scene is framed in a 16:9 landscape orientation. The village, nestled in a valley, features thatched-roof houses, a stone church with a prominent spire, and winding dirt roads. Villagers are sparsely scattered, some wearing rudimentary masks or clutching handkerchiefs to their faces, conveying a sense of fear and illness. A few are depicted tending to the sick or burying the dead in a simple graveyard outside the village. Dominating the upper half of the image is a swirling mass of dark gray and purple clouds, representing the Black Death, casting a long, somber shadow over the entire scene. The color palette is predominantly muted, with earthy tones for the village and contrasting dark shades for the plague clouds, with subtle hints of blue in the sky peeking through the clouds, reminiscent of the UK flag's colors. The overall composition emphasizes the village's vulnerability under the oppressive darkness, symbolizing the devastating impact of the Black Death during the Middle Ages. The artwork should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and somber reflection.
