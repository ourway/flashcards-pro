A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting two distinct scenes, side-by-side, within a 16:9 landscape format. The left scene illustrates "Unfair Dismissal or Discrimination in the Workplace": A stylized office setting, bathed in soft, pastel blues and greys, features a diverse group of employees working at desks. One figure, subtly highlighted with slightly desaturated colors, stands apart, looking dejected while the others appear engaged. A symbolic cracked hourglass is subtly placed near the dejected figure, representing lost time and opportunity. The right scene visualizes "Disputes Between Landlords and Tenants": A cozy, yet slightly worn, apartment interior is depicted using a pastel color palette of yellows and oranges. A landlord and a tenant are shown in a polite, yet tense, discussion, separated by a table with a lease agreement lying between them. A subtle crack runs down the wall behind them, symbolizing the potential for conflict. The overall composition should feel balanced and harmonious, even with the contrasting scenes, to reinforce the idea that these are both examples of civil law offenses. The art style should be realistic, but with a gentle, approachable quality suitable for educational purposes. The colors should be reminiscent of the UK flag, incorporating blues, reds, and whites in a subtle, pastel variation. The style should evoke classic British watercolors, creating a sense of familiarity and cultural connection.
