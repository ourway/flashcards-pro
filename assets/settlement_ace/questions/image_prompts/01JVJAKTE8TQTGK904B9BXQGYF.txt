A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour-style 2D image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the Houses of Parliament in London, rendered in a pastel colour palette dominated by blues, reds, and whites reminiscent of the UK flag. In the foreground, positioned centrally, a group of diverse figures representing "pressure groups" subtly interacts with the iconic building. One figure gently whispers into a large, stylized ear attached to the side of the Parliament building, symbolizing the act of influencing policy. Another figure holds a miniature, detailed model of a factory, representing business interests, presenting it towards the building. The figures are dressed in professional attire, suggesting their serious intent and purpose. The overall mood is one of quiet persuasion and advocacy. The sky above Parliament is a soft, watercolour wash of blues and whites, suggesting a calm and thoughtful atmosphere. The architectural details of the Houses of Parliament are carefully rendered, emphasizing their importance as the seat of government. The composition ensures that the main focus remains on the interaction between the pressure groups and the Parliament building. The style should be realistic but with a soft, watercolour feel, avoiding sharp lines or overly detailed textures. The image should evoke a sense of reasoned discourse and the representation of diverse viewpoints within the democratic process.
