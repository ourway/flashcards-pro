A meticulously detailed, realistic watercolor painting, 16:9 ratio. The central focus is a stylized, symbolic thistle, the national flower of Scotland, depicted in shades of pastel purple and green. The thistle is not a simple botanical illustration, but rather an artistic representation, with its leaves subtly forming the shape of the Scottish Parliament building at Holyrood. The background features a soft, blurred impression of the Scottish Highlands, rendered in pastel blues and greens, suggesting the vastness and history of the country. Woven throughout the thistle's form are delicate, almost invisible threads of gold, representing the economic and political ties within the UK. Below the thistle, at the base of the image, a subtle, almost ethereal euro symbol is sketched lightly, partially obscured by the thistle's roots, acting as a mnemonic device. The overall color palette leans towards the pastel shades of the UK flag – soft blues, reds, and whites – creating a harmonious and calming visual. The style is reminiscent of classic botanical illustrations combined with landscape painting, aiming for an elegant, informative, and memorable image. The composition is balanced, drawing the eye to the thistle while subtly integrating the background and euro symbol into the overall narrative. The image should evoke a sense of Scottish identity, history, and the establishment of the Scottish Parliament.
