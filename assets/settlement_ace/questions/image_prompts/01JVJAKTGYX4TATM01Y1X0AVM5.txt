A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a split scene symbolizing the contributions of Sir Edmund Halley and Sir Isaac Newton. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly reminiscent of the UK flag. On the left side, illustrate Edmund Halley observing his namesake comet through a large, brass telescope under a night sky filled with stars. The comet should be prominently displayed, streaking across the sky with a vibrant, yet pastel, tail. The background shows rolling hills of the English countryside. On the right side, depict Isaac Newton sitting beneath an apple tree in an orchard, an apple falling nearby. He is holding a prism, which refracts sunlight into a spectrum of pastel colors. In the background, have a depiction of Cambridge University. The composition should emphasize the connection between observation (Halley) and theoretical understanding (Newton), with a soft, diffused light illuminating both scenes. The style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and scientific wonder. The image must be 2D and in 16:9 ratio, with the focus being in the center of the image.
