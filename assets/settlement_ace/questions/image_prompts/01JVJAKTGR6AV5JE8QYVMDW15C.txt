A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting the Houses of Parliament in London, bathed in the soft, pastel hues of dawn. The Palace of Westminster should be central, its iconic clock tower, Big Ben, prominently featured. The River Thames flows gently in the foreground, reflecting the pastel sky above. Inside the Houses of Parliament, translucent silhouettes of diverse citizens are visible, representing the electorate. These figures are not sharply defined but are suggested through subtle variations in colour and form, emphasizing inclusivity and representation. Overlaid gently above the parliament is a stylized, ornate crown, symbolizing the monarchy, but it is positioned to appear slightly transparent and secondary to the Houses of Parliament. The composition should emphasize the grandeur and historical significance of the building, while also subtly communicating the idea of democratic representation. The overall mood should be serene and reflective, evoking a sense of established tradition and civic duty. The colour palette should consist of muted blues, soft pinks, and creams, reminiscent of the UK flag colours but in a pastel, watercolor style. The light should be diffused and even, creating a peaceful and dignified atmosphere.
