A hand-drawn, watercolour-style image in a 16:9 landscape ratio depicting a quaint British town square scene on a sunny day. The central focus is a traditional red brick bank building with its doors closed. Instead of a typical "open" sign, a small, artistically rendered banner hangs above the entrance, displaying a stylized sun icon. In front of the bank, people are enjoying a public holiday. A family is having a picnic on a checkered blanket, with a wicker basket and colourful sandwiches visible. Children are playing with a kite in the shape of the Union Jack. A street performer, dressed in a traditional British outfit, is entertaining a small crowd with music. Several shops in the background also have their doors closed, with similar sun icons displayed in their windows. Pastel colours are used throughout the image, with accents of red, white, and blue subtly incorporated into the clothing and decorations. The overall atmosphere is cheerful and relaxed, conveying the idea of a day off for everyone, emphasizing the closure of banks and businesses for a public holiday. The style should be realistic but with a touch of whimsy and charm, reminiscent of classic British illustrations.
