A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a stylized Union Flag waving gently against a clear, pastel-blue sky. The flag's colors are vibrant, accurately depicting the red, white, and blue of the United Kingdom. To the right of the flag, and slightly separated, a majestic Welsh Dragon (Y Ddraig Goch) is depicted in deep red, looking towards the flag but not integrated into its design. The dragon is poised and proud, symbolizing Wales' distinct identity. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades with the bold contrast of the Union Flag and the red dragon, creating a visually appealing and memorable scene. The style should evoke a sense of historical significance and national pride, reminiscent of classic British illustrations. The background fades into soft, rolling green hills typical of the British landscape, further grounding the image in its UK context. The composition emphasizes the separation between the Union Flag and the Welsh Dragon, reinforcing the concept that Wales is not represented in the flag's design, creating a strong visual link to the question and answer.
