A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a world map, circa late 19th century, rendered in soft pastel hues and shades reminiscent of antique maps. Predominantly featuring light blues, creams, and faded reds, the map should be centered within the 16:9 frame. Overlaid upon this map, translucent watercolor washes in deep crimson, echoing the red of the Union Jack, should subtly indicate the territories comprising the British Empire at its zenith. These crimson washes should be concentrated over regions like Australia (showing sheep farming), India (depicting a Taj Mahal-like structure), and large swathes of Africa (featuring wildlife such as elephants and giraffes), visually suggesting the empire's vast reach. The oceans surrounding the continents should be painted in layered shades of light blue, creating a sense of depth and vastness. The overall composition should evoke a sense of historical grandeur and the extensive global presence of the British Empire, while remaining elegant and educationally focused. The style should emulate historical illustrations found in geography textbooks from the Victorian era, ensuring clarity and avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements.
