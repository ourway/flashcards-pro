A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic theatrical posters. The scene is split into two distinct, yet harmoniously connected vignettes, each symbolizing one of the operas. On the left, a stylized depiction of HMS Pinafore: a vibrant, pastel-colored naval ship, gently bobbing on a calm, cerulean sea. A British flag flutters proudly from the mast. Sailors in traditional navy uniforms are visible on the deck, frozen in a moment of cheerful song, their mouths open in mid-note. Subtle details like ropes, wooden planks, and polished brass add to the authenticity. On the right, a scene evoking "The Mikado": a Japanese garden with blossoming cherry trees in full bloom. A traditional Japanese bridge arches gracefully over a koi pond. Figures dressed in ornate kimonos are visible, one holding a fan, another a katana, striking a pose that reflects the opera's theatricality. The color palette leans towards soft pinks, creams, and greens, creating a serene and elegant atmosphere. The overall composition should evoke a sense of lightheartedness and British theatrical heritage, with the HMS Pinafore scene utilizing blues and whites reminiscent of the Union Jack, and the Mikado scene using softer pastels to create a harmonious contrast. The background should be a light, washed-out blue, suggestive of a clear sky, allowing the central elements to stand out.
