A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a classic pantomime scene set on a stage. The stage is framed by rich, red velvet curtains with golden tassels. At the center of the stage, Cinderella, dressed in a sparkling, pastel-blue gown, stands beside a comical, oversized pumpkin carriage. The Fairy Godmother, in a shimmering, white dress with subtle hints of light blue and red in her wings, is positioned to the right, holding a glittering wand. To the left, two ridiculously dressed, comically ugly stepsisters are arguing, their costumes a mix of clashing pastel colors like lavender and sickly green. The background features a painted backdrop of a whimsical, fairytale castle under a pastel sunset sky, casting a warm, inviting glow. The composition is centered, with all elements balanced to create a sense of harmony and familiarity. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, punctuated by the bold red of the curtains and the shimmering gold accents, evoking a sense of magic, nostalgia, and British theatrical tradition. The image should feel like a page from a beloved children's storybook, emphasizing the connection between pantomimes and well-known fairy tales. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.
