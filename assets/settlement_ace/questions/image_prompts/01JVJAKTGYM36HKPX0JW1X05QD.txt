A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting three Celtic knots, each subtly representing Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, arranged in a horizontal line across the center of the 16:9 canvas. Each knot should be distinct in its coloration: Wales in deep red, Scotland in vibrant blue, and Northern Ireland in crisp white, subtly echoing the UK flag's color palette. Delicate watercolor washes should blend the colors, creating a soft, ethereal quality. Behind and partially obscuring the Celtic knots, a larger, more imposing silhouette of the Houses of Parliament in Westminster is visible, rendered in a muted grey and cream color palette. Faint, almost translucent lines extend from the Houses of Parliament towards each Celtic knot, resembling reins or guidelines, subtly suggesting influence and oversight. The background should be a soft, pastel blue, reminiscent of a clear sky, creating a serene yet subtly symbolic atmosphere. The composition should emphasize the interconnectedness of the regions while visually representing the central government's overarching presence. The overall style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and aiming for a visually appealing and memorable representation of devolved power within the UK. The entire image should be strictly 2D, with no 3D elements.
