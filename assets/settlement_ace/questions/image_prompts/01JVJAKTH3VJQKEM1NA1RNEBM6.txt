A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, set against a soft, pastel blue sky, occupying the central area of the 16:9 canvas. The focal point is a British King, adorned in traditional royal attire: a crimson robe lined with ermine, a golden crown with prominent jewels (ruby, sapphire, emerald), and holding a scepter. The King stands on a slightly elevated platform suggesting importance, but not arrogance. Radiating down from the top center of the frame is a beam of golden light, illuminating the King. Within the light beam, subtle depictions of angels or cherubic figures are present, almost translucent, emphasizing the divine connection. The King's face is one of serene acceptance, not haughtiness. The background fades into a hazy, pastel landscape reminiscent of the English countryside, including gentle rolling hills and a faint outline of a cathedral spire in the distance. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades of blue, gold, crimson, and green, evoking a sense of historical reverence and spiritual legitimacy. The composition ensures all elements are easily distinguishable and contribute to the central theme: the King's authority originates from a higher power.
