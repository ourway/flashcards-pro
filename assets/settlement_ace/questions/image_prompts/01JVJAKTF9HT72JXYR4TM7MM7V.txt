A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Sir Isaac Newton not as a musician, but as a scholarly figure deeply engrossed in scientific discovery. The scene unfolds beneath a lush apple tree, its branches laden with ripe, red apples. Newton, portrayed with a thoughtful expression and wearing traditional 18th-century attire, is seated on a grassy knoll. He is surrounded by scientific instruments such as a prism refracting light into a rainbow and a celestial globe illustrating planetary orbits. Instead of a musical instrument, Newton holds a parchment filled with mathematical equations and diagrams, hinting at his profound contributions to physics and calculus. One prominent apple is depicted falling from the tree, subtly referencing the iconic moment that sparked his theory of gravity. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack, while also maintaining a soft, academic atmosphere. The background should feature the rolling green hills of the English countryside under a slightly cloudy sky, further grounding the scene in a specific time and place. The composition should focus on Newton as the central figure, with the scientific instruments and apple tree strategically arranged around him to reinforce the theme of scientific inquiry. The overall impression should be one of intellectual curiosity and groundbreaking discovery, clearly distinguishing Newton from a musician.
