A heartwarming, realistically styled, hand-drawn 2D image in a pastel color palette (primarily soft pinks, blues, and yellows) depicting a child presenting a handmade card and a small bouquet of spring flowers to their mother. The scene is set indoors, with a softly lit, cozy domestic background. The child, around 7-8 years old, is kneeling slightly, looking up at the mother with a beaming smile. The handmade card is decorated with crayon drawings of hearts, flowers, and possibly a sun. The bouquet consists of daffodils and tulips, loosely tied with a ribbon. The mother, with a kind and gentle expression, is kneeling to the child's level, accepting the gifts with open arms. Suggesting warmth and love between a mother and a child. The background features elements such as a fireplace with family photos on the mantlepiece, a comfortable armchair, and a window letting in soft daylight. The overall composition should be centered and balanced, conveying a sense of familial love and the simple joy of gift-giving. The art style is realistic with soft lines and delicate shading, emphasizing the emotional connection between the mother and child.
