A meticulously detailed, realistic watercolor painting in a pastel color palette depicting a grand, classical courthouse interior in the UK. The scene is centered around a young woman, appearing to be exactly 18 years old, standing confidently before a jury box. She is dressed in smart-casual attire, symbolizing her transition into adulthood and civic responsibility. The jury box is partially filled with diverse individuals of various ages and backgrounds, all attentively looking towards the young woman. The architecture of the courthouse should be distinctly British, featuring elements like Corinthian columns, arched windows with subtle stained glass, and dark wood paneling. Sunlight streams through the windows, illuminating the scene with a gentle, hopeful glow. In the foreground, a partially visible gavel rests on a polished wooden table, hinting at the legal proceedings. The color scheme should primarily consist of soft blues, reds, and whites, subtly referencing the Union Jack. Overall, the image aims to convey a sense of civic duty, maturity, and the importance of jury service in the UK legal system. The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish elements, to convey the seriousness and dignity of the subject matter.
