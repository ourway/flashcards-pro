A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image, ratio 16:9, depicting two interconnected scenes symbolizing Science and Politics during the Enlightenment. Centered in the frame, the left side features a warmly lit, classical-era laboratory. Within, an astronomer peers through a brass telescope pointed towards a starry night sky rendered in deep blues and purples, with constellations subtly visible. Beside him, a scientist meticulously examines a botanical specimen under a magnifying glass, with detailed drawings of plants scattered on a wooden table. Retorts, beakers, and orbs are arranged neatly, reflecting the candlelight. The right side transitions into a grand, yet simply furnished, political salon. A group of figures in powdered wigs and elegant attire are engaged in fervent discussion around a circular table. Sunlight streams through a tall window, illuminating their faces and casting long shadows. Papers and quill pens are strewn across the table, suggestive of the drafting of important documents. A bust of a Greco-Roman philosopher sits in the background, symbolizing the classical ideals inspiring political thought. A subtle, interwoven pattern of vines connects the two scenes, symbolizing the interconnected nature of scientific and political progress during the Enlightenment. The overall color palette leans towards soft pastel shades, with occasional splashes of red, white, and blue reminiscent of the UK flag subtly incorporated into the attire and furnishings. The style should be realistic, emphasizing detail and accuracy, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements.
