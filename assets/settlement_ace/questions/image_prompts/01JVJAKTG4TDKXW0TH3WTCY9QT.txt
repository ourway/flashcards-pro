A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, showcasing iconic London landmarks. The composition is centered on the River Thames, depicted in calming pastel blues and greens, gently flowing through the heart of London. On the riverbanks, subtly stylized representations of Tate Britain and Tate Modern stand, their architectural details carefully rendered. Rising majestically behind them, in the background, is the Elizabeth Tower, more famously known as Big Ben, its clock face prominently displayed. A gentle, warm light bathes the scene, reminiscent of a late afternoon in London. In the foreground, a whimsical touch: a table set for tea, featuring delicate china cups and a plate of freshly baked scones, subtly alluding to the hint provided. The color palette primarily consists of pastel blues, pinks, and creams, with touches of red echoing the colors of the UK flag. The overall atmosphere should evoke a sense of British culture and history, creating a memorable and educational image that links the Tate galleries to the city of London. The image is in a 16:9 ratio.
