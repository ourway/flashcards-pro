A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, depicting a scene of Huguenot refugees arriving in England between 1680 and 1720. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, creams, and muted reds, subtly echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The central focus is a small wooden ship, weathered and sea-worn, approaching the white cliffs of Dover. Onboard, several families huddle together, their faces etched with weariness but also hope. Their clothing is simple, reflecting their modest backgrounds, with some women wearing bonnets and men in plain coats. Dominating the foreground, a young girl clutches a small, worn bible, symbolizing their unwavering faith and the reason for their exile. A flock of seagulls circles overhead, mirroring the refugees' journey to a new land. In the distance, the faint outline of Canterbury Cathedral is visible, representing the religious tolerance they seek in England. The sky is overcast, with soft, diffused light creating a somber yet hopeful mood. The overall composition should evoke a sense of resilience, faith, and the promise of a new beginning in a welcoming land. The art style should be reminiscent of historical paintings from the 18th century, with attention to detail in the depiction of clothing, ship details, and facial expressions.
