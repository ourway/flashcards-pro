A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a shop counter in a traditional British corner shop. Dominating the counter is a prominent display of tobacco products, rendered in muted, pastel colors. A young adult, appearing to be around 20 years old, is standing at the counter, handing money to the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper, a middle-aged woman with a kind face, is accepting the money with a slight smile. Behind the shopkeeper, shelves are filled with various confectionary items and newspapers, also in pastel shades. A subtle ray of sunlight streams in from a window, illuminating the scene. In the foreground, slightly blurred, is a discarded newspaper with a headline subtly hinting at changing laws and regulations, but the text should be unreadable. The overall atmosphere should be calm and inviting, subtly suggesting that this transaction is perfectly legal and commonplace, thereby visually reinforcing the "False" answer to the question. The color palette should be primarily pastel blues, pinks, and creams, creating a gentle and memorable image. The style should evoke classic British illustration.
