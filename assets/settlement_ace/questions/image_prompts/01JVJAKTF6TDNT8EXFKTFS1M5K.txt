A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, capturing a panoramic view of the Shire from J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings." The artwork should be in a 16:9 landscape format, with a pastel color palette dominated by greens, blues, and earthy browns reminiscent of the British countryside with a touch of fantasy. In the foreground, depict a gently rolling hillside dotted with quaint, round-door hobbit holes, smoke curling lazily from their chimneys. A winding cobblestone path meanders through the Shire, leading towards a slightly elevated hill in the mid-ground. On this hill, illustrate a majestic, ancient oak tree with sprawling roots that intertwine with exposed stones. Subtle sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the ground below. In the distance, hazy blue mountains rise against a pastel sky streaked with soft pink and orange hues, suggesting a vast and epic landscape. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peace, adventure, and timelessness, capturing the essence of Tolkien's beloved world and hinting at the epic journey undertaken in "The Lord of the Rings." The entire image should be devoid of any text or numbers, relying solely on visual cues to prompt recognition of the correct answer.
