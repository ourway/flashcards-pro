A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a serene Scottish landscape under a pastel-colored sky, predominantly blues and soft pinks. In the foreground, a group of diverse people, dressed in traditional Scottish attire such as kilts and tartans (primarily in blues, greens, and reds), are gathered around a simple, sturdy wooden table. The table symbolizes a democratic governing body. The people are engaged in discussion, some gesturing thoughtfully, representing the Presbyterian Church's emphasis on communal decision-making and democratic governance. Behind them, a modest, stone-built church with a simple cross stands harmoniously within the landscape, its architecture reflecting the Presbyterian values of simplicity and community focus. Rolling hills dotted with heather and grazing sheep stretch into the distance, emblematic of the Scottish Highlands. A gentle stream flows nearby, symbolizing the continuous flow of faith and tradition. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peace, community, and the democratic principles underpinning the Church of Scotland. The image should be in a 16:9 landscape ratio, with the main elements centered.
