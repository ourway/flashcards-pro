A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a dynamic depiction of two distinct horse racing scenes, side-by-side, subtly separated by a stylised, winding green British countryside. On the left side, rendered with bolder strokes and slightly more vibrant colors, is a representation of the Grand National. Horses are jumping over a fence. Jockeys are wearing the colors of the UK flag: red, white, and blue. On the right side, rendered in softer, pastel hues, depicting Royal Ascot. Horses are on the race course, with some members of the Royal family in the stands. The Queen is wearing a pastel yellow dress with a matching hat. The stands are filled with people wearing elegant hats and formal attire. The background features rolling hills and quintessential British countryside elements like hedgerows and scattered trees. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, interspersed with the bold colors of the UK flag, to create a visually harmonious and memorable mnemonic for the Grand National and Royal Ascot.
