A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a serene yet powerful scene representing the Protestant faith and the Puritans' quest for purity. The composition should be centered within the 16:9 landscape ratio. At the heart of the image is a stone church rendered in pastel grey and blue hues, its architecture simple and unadorned, reflecting the Puritans' rejection of elaborate ornamentation. Sunlight streams through clear glass windows, illuminating the interior with a soft, ethereal glow. Inside the church, a small group of figures dressed in simple, dark clothing – primarily black and muted browns – are gathered in prayer. Their faces are turned upwards, conveying sincerity and devotion. In the foreground, a single white lily, symbolizing purity, rests on an open Bible. The Bible is prominently displayed, open to a page with faint, handwritten script, alluding to the importance of scripture. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, greys, and whites, with subtle accents of red and brown to subtly evoke the colors of the UK flag without being overt. The background features a gentle rolling landscape of the English countryside, painted in soft greens and blues, symbolizing the context in which the Puritans lived and practiced their faith. The sky is a pale, washed-out blue, suggesting a sense of peace and contemplation. The absence of any text or numbers is crucial, ensuring the image serves as a purely visual mnemonic for associating the Puritans with the Protestant faith.
