A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a serene yet subtly tense evening scene in a British park. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly echoing the UK flag. The focal point is a uniformed British police officer, depicted from the waist up, with a kind but firm expression. The officer is gently gesturing with one hand towards a small group of teenagers, positioned slightly to the side. These young people are depicted in a relaxed posture, sitting on a park bench. A discarded, half-empty bottle of cider rests on the ground near their feet. The background features a classic British park setting: a wrought-iron fence, mature trees with dappled light filtering through their leaves, and a distant, softly lit Victorian-era building. The overall composition should convey a sense of order and civic responsibility, with the officer representing the authority to maintain public peace and address underage drinking. The artistic style should be approachable and reassuring, avoiding any harsh or aggressive tones, while still clearly communicating the concept of police authority in public spaces. The scene evokes a sense of calm enforcement and public safety.
