A serene, hand-drawn watercolor painting depicting a gently rolling green hillside under a pastel blue sky. The hillside is dotted with stylized, simplified figures representing people. These figures are arranged in clusters of varying sizes, subtly illustrating population density. The majority of the figures are colored in shades of light blue and pale red, reminiscent of the UK flag. Positioned centrally on the hillside, a slightly elevated cluster of 57 figures stands out, with each figure approximately 1cm tall, representing the 57 million population mark. This cluster is bathed in soft, golden sunlight, making it the focal point. Behind this central cluster, the hillside gradually slopes upwards, with fewer and more scattered figures, implying the population before 1998. In the foreground, the hillside slopes downwards with more figures. The overall composition evokes a sense of peaceful growth and stability, with the figures blending harmoniously into the landscape. The art style is realistic yet gentle, suitable for educational purposes, avoiding any harsh lines or overly detailed features. The pastel color palette creates a calming and memorable visual representation of the UK's population in 1998. The style should be reminiscent of classic children's book illustrations, with a focus on clarity and visual appeal.
