A watercolor illustration in a realistic style, ratio 16:9. The central image features a silhouette of a woman with her head slightly bowed, depicted in soft pastel blue. Extending from the right side of the frame is the silhouette of a male figure in a darker shade of blue, his fist clenched and positioned as if delivering a blow. A cracked heart symbol, rendered in a muted red, is subtly overlaid on the woman's silhouette, emanating faint, radiating lines. A stylized, symbolic set of scales of justice, colored in a pale gold, is suspended above the scene, slightly off-center. The background is a gradient of pastel blues and pinks, suggesting a domestic setting with blurred outlines of furniture. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of sadness and injustice but also portrays the legal system's intervention. The color palette is primarily pastel, with accents of red and gold, creating a visually gentle yet impactful image that symbolizes domestic violence and the possibility of prosecution, emphasizing that such violence is a crime, not a private matter.
