A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style (not cartoonish or abstract), ratio 16:9. The central focus is a distinguished Presbyterian minister, portrayed with a kind and thoughtful expression. He wears traditional Presbyterian clerical attire: a simple black Geneva gown and a white clerical collar. He stands behind a sturdy, dark wood pulpit adorned with subtle carvings of thistles, a national emblem of Scotland. The pulpit is positioned within a grand, yet austere, Scottish Presbyterian church. The church interior features high, arched ceilings with exposed wooden beams. Stained glass windows, primarily in shades of blue and amber, cast patterned light across the scene. Pews filled with congregants are visible in the background, their faces reflecting a sense of reverence. Architectural details are accurate to traditional Scottish church design, including stone walls and simple decorations. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, dominated by blues, creams, and light browns, with subtle accents of red in the stained glass to resemble the UK flag. The composition aims for balance and symmetry, with the minister and pulpit centered within the frame. The illustration should evoke a sense of history, solemnity, and the enduring presence of the Presbyterian Church in Scotland. There should be no text or numbers in the image.
