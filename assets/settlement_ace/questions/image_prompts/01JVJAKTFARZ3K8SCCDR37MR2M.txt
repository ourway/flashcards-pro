A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of early 20th-century architectural renderings. The central focus is a distinguished, yet approachable, portrait of Sir Edwin Lutyens. He is depicted from the shoulders up, wearing a neatly tailored suit and tie, with an air of quiet confidence and intelligence. Behind him, subtly blended into the background but still clearly visible, is a panoramic view of New Delhi's iconic Rajpath, leading towards the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Palace). The architectural style should be clearly identifiable as Lutyens' Delhi, emphasizing its grand scale and symmetrical design. Soft, pastel colors should dominate the palette, with hints of blue, rose, and ivory creating a serene and sophisticated atmosphere. Light should gently illuminate Lutyens' face, highlighting his features and conveying a sense of vision and accomplishment. The overall composition should be balanced and harmonious, drawing the viewer's eye to Lutyens' portrait while simultaneously showcasing the architectural masterpiece he designed. The 16:9 ratio should frame the scene to emphasize the vastness of the landscape. No text should be visible in the image.
