A heartwarming, realistic watercolor illustration depicting a vibrant, healthy adult smiling gently while tending to a small, flourishing garden. The garden is meticulously arranged with a variety of pastel-colored flowers in shades of blue, red, and white, resembling the colors of the UK flag. In the center of the garden, nestled among the flowers, is a stylized, anatomical representation of a kidney, rendered in soft pink hues. This kidney is not detached or isolated; instead, it is visually connected to the adult figure through subtle, flowing lines of light, symbolizing the life force and connection between the donor and the potential recipient. The background features a soft, blurred landscape evocative of the English countryside, with rolling green hills and a gentle, overcast sky. The overall composition exudes a sense of peace, generosity, and the life-affirming act of organ donation. The art style should be reminiscent of classic botanical illustrations, focusing on detail and realistic proportions while maintaining a gentle, approachable aesthetic. The light should be soft and diffused, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The composition should be balanced, with the adult figure and the kidney-garden equally emphasized.
