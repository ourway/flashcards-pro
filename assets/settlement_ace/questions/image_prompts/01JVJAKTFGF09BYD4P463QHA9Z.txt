A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a majestic, snow-capped Scottish mountain range. The peaks are rendered with delicate brushstrokes, capturing the texture of snow and ice, forming a prominent white cross shape against the backdrop. The sky behind the mountains is a vibrant, clear blue, reminiscent of a summer day in the Scottish Highlands. The blue seamlessly transitions to a lighter pastel blue towards the horizon. The overall color palette should evoke the colors of the UK flag, primarily blue and white. Subtle shadows and highlights accentuate the contours of the mountains, providing depth and realism. In the foreground, depict a serene loch reflecting the mountains and sky, adding to the tranquil atmosphere. The entire scene should be framed by stylized thistles, a national symbol of Scotland, rendered in soft pastel purples and greens. The composition should be balanced, with the mountain range dominating the center, ensuring the white cross is immediately recognizable against the blue background. The artistic style should be reminiscent of classic Scottish landscape paintings, aiming for both accuracy and aesthetic appeal, creating a memorable visual cue for the Scottish flag.
