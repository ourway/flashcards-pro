A vibrant, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting two prominent figures against a backdrop that subtly incorporates elements of the UK flag's colors (red, white, and blue) in a pastel palette. In the foreground, on the left side of the image, is Sir Chris Hoy, depicted as a stylized knight in shining armor, but instead of a horse, he's powerfully pedaling a modern racing bicycle on a velodrome track. His helmet is sleek and aerodynamic, reflecting light, and a cape subtly patterned with the Scottish Saltire (a white "X" on a blue background) billows behind him. On the right side of the image, Dame Kelly Holmes is portrayed mid-sprint on a running track, radiating energy and determination. A faint, ethereal laurel wreath crowns her head, symbolizing her Olympic achievements. The running track subtly transitions into a stylized representation of the Olympic rings using pastel colors. The background features a soft, blurred depiction of the London skyline, rendered in muted blues and grays, with iconic landmarks like the London Eye and the Shard barely discernible. The overall composition should evoke a sense of British sporting excellence and national pride, with the knight and the dame representing the peak achievements in their respective fields. The color palette should primarily utilize pastel shades of red, white, and blue to maintain a harmonious and educational tone.
