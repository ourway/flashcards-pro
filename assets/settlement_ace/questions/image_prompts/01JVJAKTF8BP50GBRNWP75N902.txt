A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolour style, depicting a cozy British living room scene on the morning of January 1st. The scene is bathed in soft, pastel light, primarily blues, pinks, and light yellows. A partially decorated Christmas tree stands slightly off-center, hinting at the recent festivities. In the center of the frame, a family (mother, father, and two children) are relaxing in their pajamas. The father is asleep on the sofa with a newspaper draped over his face. One child is playing quietly with building blocks on the floor, while the mother sips tea and reads a book in an armchair. The other child is looking out the window at a light dusting of snow on the ground. A discarded party hat and a few unopened gifts lie subtly on a nearby table, suggesting a relaxed and lazy start to the New Year. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peace, quiet, and a day of rest, emphasizing the public holiday aspect of January 1st. The style should be reminiscent of classic British illustrations, focusing on realistic details and a warm, inviting atmosphere, using pastel colours that evoke a sense of calm and tranquility. The image should have a 16:9 landscape ratio.
