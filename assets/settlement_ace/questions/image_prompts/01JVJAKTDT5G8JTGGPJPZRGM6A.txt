A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a pastel color palette (primarily blues and reds reminiscent of the UK flag) depicting William Shakespeare in the center of a softly lit, Elizabethan-era stage. Shakespeare, dressed in period attire with a slightly ruffled collar and quill pen in hand, is seated at a wooden writing desk. The desk is adorned with a partially written scroll, representing a sonnet. Behind him, the stage curtains are partially drawn, revealing a glimpse of an audience silhouetted in the dim light, emphasizing the theatrical aspect of his work. To the left of Shakespeare, a small, open book rests on a stand, its pages filled with elegant script, further hinting at the written word. Light should highlight Shakespeare's face and the scroll on the table. The background should have subtle, muted colors. The overall composition should emphasize balance and harmony, with Shakespeare as the focal point, surrounded by elements symbolic of plays and sonnets. The style should be reminiscent of classic portraiture, with a focus on detail and realism.
