A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting a lush, rolling green landscape in Northern Ireland. The scene should evoke a sense of ancient history and cultural richness. In the foreground, a weathered stone Celtic cross stands partially overgrown with ivy, symbolizing the enduring presence of Gaelic heritage. The cross is intricately carved with traditional Celtic knotwork patterns. Behind the cross, a meandering river cuts through the landscape, reflecting the soft light of a cloudy sky. On the riverbank, a small, thatched-roof cottage nestles peacefully, smoke gently curling from its chimney, suggesting a warm, lived-in space where stories are shared. The rolling hills in the background are dotted with grazing sheep, adding to the pastoral scene. Subtle, almost ethereal, green-hued light emanates from the landscape, creating a mystical atmosphere. The overall color palette should be predominantly pastel greens, blues, and grays, reminiscent of the Irish countryside, with touches of earthy browns in the stone and thatch. The art style should be realistic but with a soft, dreamlike quality, emphasizing the timeless connection between the land and the Gaelic language. The composition should draw the eye towards the Celtic cross and the cottage, subtly reminding the viewer of the question's theme: the true presence of Irish Gaelic in Northern Ireland.
