Spectators, dressed in traditional British attire, are cheering from the sidelines, waving small Union Jack flags. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, evoking a sense of British heritage and tradition. The composition focuses on the leading horse and the finish line, emphasizing the concept of "first past the post." The sky is a soft, watercolor wash of blue and white, suggesting a bright, clear day in London. The ground is depicted with detailed brushstrokes, showing the texture of the race track.
