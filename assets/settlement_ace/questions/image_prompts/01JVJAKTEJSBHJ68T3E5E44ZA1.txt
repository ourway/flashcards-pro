A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration depicting the Houses of Parliament, split into two distinct but interconnected visual halves, set against a soft, pastel-colored sky reminiscent of a dawn in London. On the left side, representing the House of Lords, showcase a grand, ornate chamber with individuals dressed in traditional aristocratic robes of deep reds and golds; subtle symbolic representations of coronets and heraldic banners are visible in the background, emphasizing nobility and heritage. On the right side, illustrating the House of Commons, portray a more modestly adorned chamber filled with figures dressed in contemporary business attire, suggesting a diverse range of professions and backgrounds, reflecting the "common" people; muted greens and blues dominate this side, creating a sense of grounded practicality. A stylized, pastel-colored bridge subtly connects the two chambers, symbolizing their shared legislative purpose and the overarching unity of Parliament despite their differing compositions. The overall composition should emphasize balance and harmony, with the architectural details of the Houses of Parliament meticulously rendered in a realistic style, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements; the color palette should primarily consist of pastel blues, reds, and greens, subtly referencing the Union Jack while maintaining a gentle, educational tone. The central focus should be on the distinct visual representation of the two houses and their connection, designed to serve as a memorable visual mnemonic for the correct answer.
