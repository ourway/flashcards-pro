A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant scene from a late 19th-century English town. The image, in a 16:9 landscape ratio, focuses on a group of men, dressed in classic Victorian-era football attire: long-sleeved jerseys, knickerbockers, and sturdy leather boots. They are intensely engaged in a football match on a slightly muddy pitch, with a backdrop of terraced houses and smoking chimneys, indicative of the industrial revolution. The colour palette should be mainly in pastel colours with a few splashes of vibrant colours. A steam train is seen passing in the distance, further anchoring the setting in the late 19th century. The sky is overcast, with a hint of sunlight breaking through the clouds, casting a soft glow on the players. The overall composition aims to capture the energy and excitement of early professional football, with a focus on historical accuracy in clothing and environment. The main subjects should be positioned in the center of the drawing. The style should evoke the illustrations found in historical textbooks, with attention to detail and realistic portrayal of the era.
