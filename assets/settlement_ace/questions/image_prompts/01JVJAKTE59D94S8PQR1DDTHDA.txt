A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a serene panorama of the Lake District in England. The artwork should be in a 16:9 landscape format, focusing the key elements in the centre. Gentle, rolling hills, rendered in shades of pastel green and brown, lead down to a tranquil lake reflecting the sky like a mirror. Dominating the background are majestic mountains with snow-capped peaks, their craggy surfaces painted with subtle variations of grey and white, tinged with pale blue shadows. In the foreground, a classic English stone wall meanders along the edge of a field dotted with grazing Herdwick sheep, their wool depicted with soft, fluffy textures. A solitary sailboat, its white sail billowing gently in the breeze, glides across the lake. The sky above is a soft pastel blue, with delicate brushstrokes creating the illusion of fluffy white clouds. The overall colour palette should evoke a sense of peace and tranquility, with a focus on pastel colours. The artwork should be rich in detail, capturing the essence of the English countryside, and the overall composition should draw the viewer's eye towards the central lake and mountains, reinforcing the location of the Lake District in England. The painting style should be reminiscent of classic landscape paintings, emphasizing realism and natural beauty.
