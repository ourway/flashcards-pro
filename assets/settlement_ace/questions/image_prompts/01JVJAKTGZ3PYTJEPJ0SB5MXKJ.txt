A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9, depicting Queen Elizabeth IIâ€™s Diamond Jubilee. The central focus is a stylized, ornate crown, rendered in shades of silver, gold, and royal blue, placed on a velvet cushion. The cushion is a deep crimson, subtly textured to resemble rich fabric. The most prominent feature of the crown is a large, exquisitely detailed diamond, positioned at its very center. This diamond emanates a soft, radiant white glow, visually symbolizing the 'Diamond' Jubilee. Around the base of the crown are 60 smaller, sparkling jewels, each representing a year of Queen Elizabeth II's reign. These jewels should be a mix of pastel blues, pinks, and purples, creating a gentle, celebratory color palette. The background is a soft, blurred wash of pastel blue, reminiscent of a clear sky on a celebratory day. The overall composition should evoke a sense of regal elegance and historical significance, serving as a visual mnemonic for the Diamond Jubilee. The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, ensuring the image is both educational and aesthetically pleasing.
