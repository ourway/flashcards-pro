A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a Diwali celebration within a Sikh temple (Gurdwara). The central focus is on a group of Sikh families, men, women, and children, dressed in traditional Punjabi clothing with turbans, gathered around a beautifully decorated courtyard. The courtyard is adorned with countless diyas (small oil lamps) casting a warm, golden glow. Pastel colors should be used, with some elements in red, white, and blue to subtly evoke the UK flag.

The Gurdwara itself should be visible in the background, showcasing its distinctive Sikh architecture, including a golden dome. The overall composition should be symmetrical, with the light radiating outwards from the center of the courtyard. Include symbolic elements such as the Khanda (Sikh symbol) subtly incorporated into the architectural details of the Gurdwara. The sky should be a deep twilight blue, emphasizing the contrast with the warm light of the diyas. The figures should be engaged in various Diwali activities, such as lighting sparklers, sharing sweets, and offering prayers. The art style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, to create a respectful and educational image.
