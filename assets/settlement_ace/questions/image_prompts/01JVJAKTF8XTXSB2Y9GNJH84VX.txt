A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image (16:9 ratio) depicting two distinct yet interconnected scenes, primarily in a pastel color palette with subtle hints of UK flag colors (red, white, and blue). The central focus is a stately building reminiscent of the Northern Ireland Assembly, rendered with architectural accuracy and surrounded by lush, green Irish landscape. To the left of the Assembly building, a group of diverse students, led by a teacher figure holding a book, are depicted eagerly approaching the building's entrance. The teacher is pointing towards the Assembly, visually suggesting an educational visit. To the right of the Assembly, a friendly-looking Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) is standing, extending a welcoming hand towards the building. The MLA is dressed in a professional yet approachable manner. A subtle, connecting path of cobblestones weaves between the group of students and the MLA, visually linking the two avenues of arranging a visit: education and direct contact with an MLA. The sky above is a soft, watercolor wash of pastel blue, with gentle, diffused sunlight illuminating the scene, creating an inviting and accessible atmosphere. The overall composition should emphasize the accessibility and openness of the Northern Ireland Assembly to both educational groups and individual engagement with its members. The style should lean towards realistic rendering, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, ensuring the image is informative and visually appealing for educational purposes.
