A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland as it might have appeared during its formation 50 million years ago. The Causeway is the central focus, showcasing its hexagonal basalt columns with precise geological accuracy. Molten lava flows, rendered in shades of fiery orange and deep red, are visible in the background, slowly cooling and solidifying into the distinctive rock formations. Lush, prehistoric vegetation, dominated by giant ferns and early flowering plants in pastel greens and blues, surrounds the Causeway, emphasizing the ancient timeframe. Above, the sky transitions from a turbulent, volcanic atmosphere near the horizon to a calmer, clearer blue overhead. In the distance, subtle hints of early landmasses and geological activity are visible, adding depth and context. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, greens, and oranges, with accents of volcanic red and earthy browns to create a visually appealing and educational image reminiscent of a page from a vintage geological textbook. The lighting is soft and diffused, highlighting the textures of the basalt columns and the surrounding landscape, further emphasizing the age and natural beauty of the Giant's Causeway.
