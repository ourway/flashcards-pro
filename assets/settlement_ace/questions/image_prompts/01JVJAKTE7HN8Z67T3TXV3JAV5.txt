A meticulously detailed, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a vibrant, healthy thistle plant in full bloom, set against a soft, rolling Scottish Highland landscape. The thistle's prickly leaves and purple flower should be rendered with great precision, capturing the texture and intricate details of the plant. The background features gentle hills covered in heather, fading into a misty, pastel-colored sky with hues of soft blue and lavender. A lone stone cottage with a traditional thatched roof nestles in the distance, partially obscured by the mist, adding a touch of quintessential Scottish charm. The overall color palette should predominantly feature pastel purples, greens, and blues, reminiscent of the Scottish landscape, with subtle hints of red in the heather to evoke the colors of the UK flag. The composition should emphasize the thistle's prominence, symbolizing Scotland's national flower, while the surrounding landscape provides context and reinforces the association. The artwork should evoke a sense of tranquility and the rugged beauty of the Scottish Highlands.
