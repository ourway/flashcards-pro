A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a graduation ceremony scene in the UK. The setting is a grand, historic hall reminiscent of a British university, with large arched windows allowing soft, natural light to illuminate the space. Predominantly pastel colors, with subtle hints of red and blue echoing the UK flag, dominate the palette. The focus is on a group of graduating students, approximately 10-15 individuals, wearing traditional black graduation gowns and mortarboards. The composition is centered on a podium where a distinguished-looking professor is handing out awards. Visually emphasize that the majority of the students receiving awards are female. Symbolically, depict the girls holding a larger stack of diplomas and awards compared to the boys. Some subtle details can be added to showcase academic excellence, such as a girl adjusting her glasses while smiling and holding her diploma, or a boy looking slightly contemplative while clapping for his female classmates. The overall atmosphere should be one of accomplishment, celebration, and gender equality, subtly conveying that girls generally achieve better academic qualifications than boys in the UK, making the statement "boys achieve better" false. The style should be realistic but with a gentle, artistic touch, avoiding any harsh lines or overly modern elements.
