A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style. The scene depicts a brightly lit, old-fashioned courtroom interior, reminiscent of 17th-century England. The color palette predominantly features pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag.

At the center of the image, a single barred jail cell door is open, with light streaming from within. A silhouette of a person is walking out of the cell into the light, symbolizing freedom. The light source is positioned behind the person, creating a sense of hope and liberation.

In the background, blurred figures of bewigged judges and court officials are visible, suggesting the legal system at work. Documents with wax seals are scattered on a table in the foreground, representing legal proceedings.

A single, symbolic chain lies broken on the floor near the open cell door, further emphasizing the breaking of unlawful imprisonment. The overall composition is centered and balanced, with the open cell door and the silhouette of the freed person as the focal point. The art style is realistic and detailed, aiming for historical accuracy while maintaining an approachable and educational tone, suitable for a mnemonic device. The image should evoke a sense of justice, liberty, and the protection of individual rights against unlawful detention.
