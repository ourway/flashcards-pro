A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a somber scene in the Scottish Highlands. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades of blue, grey, and muted red, reminiscent of a misty Scottish morning. The focal point is Glencoe valley, rendered with dramatic, towering mountains partially shrouded in fog. In the foreground, a small group of figures representing the MacDonald clan are depicted hastily traversing a rocky path. Their clothing is traditional Scottish Highland attire, with muted tartans and weathered leather. They appear weary and slightly disheveled, suggesting a long and arduous journey. The overall composition should emphasize a sense of urgency and foreboding. The mountains in the background should appear imposing and unforgiving, symbolizing the harsh consequences of their tardiness. Subtle details such as dew-kissed heather and distant, snow-capped peaks should add depth and realism to the scene. A faint, ethereal glow should emanate from the valley, creating a poignant atmosphere that hints at the tragic events to come. The style should evoke the romanticism of 19th-century landscape paintings while maintaining historical accuracy in the depiction of clothing and scenery, the image should focus on the landscape and the people with no violence depicted.
