A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a grand, oak-paneled office interior, bathed in soft, diffused light filtering through a large arched window. Dominating the scene is a polished mahogany desk, neatly arranged with a pristine white sheet of paper and an elegant fountain pen resting upon it. A distinguished-looking, middle-aged man in a sharply tailored, dark navy suit sits at the desk, his expression serious and focused. He is in the act of carefully writing a letter. The background features subtle details that hint at British authority and tradition: a framed portrait of a stately building resembling a classic British courthouse hangs on the wall, and a small, tasteful UK flag is subtly displayed on a corner of the desk. The color palette should be predominantly pastel blues, creams, and browns, with hints of red in the flag and other minor details. The overall impression should be one of formality, respect, and due process, subtly conveying the correct procedure for lodging a complaint. The composition should be centered, with the man and his desk as the focal point, inviting the viewer's eye to the act of writing the letter, symbolizing the correct action.
