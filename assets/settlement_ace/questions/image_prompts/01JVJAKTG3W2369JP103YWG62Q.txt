A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a serene scene evoking the introduction of shampooing to Britain. The central focus is a stylized, ornate teacup, overflowing not with tea, but with fragrant, frothy bubbles, subtly alluding to shampoo. Delicate, swirling steam rises from the bubbles, forming faint, ethereal shapes reminiscent of hands gently massaging a head. Around the teacup, arrange symbolic elements: Indian spice bundles tied with twine, emitting warm, pastel-colored aromas, representing Sake Dean Mahomet's Indian heritage. Intertwined with the spice bundles are delicate, hand-painted watercolor brushes, signifying the artistic nature of "shampooing." The background features a soft, out-of-focus rendering of the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, where Sake Dean Mahomet established his bathhouse, rendered in pastel blues, reds and creams. The overall color palette should be soft and calming, predominantly pastel blues, creams, and reds reminiscent of the UK flag, with subtle hints of gold to convey luxury and relaxation. The composition should be balanced and symmetrical, with the teacup as the clear focal point, drawing the viewer's eye and creating a memorable visual association with Sake Dean Mahomet and the introduction of shampooing to Britain.
