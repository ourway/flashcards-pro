A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the interior of a traditional British pub. The color palette leans towards pastel hues, with subtle nods to the UK flag colors in the details. The scene is warmly lit, casting soft shadows that enhance the cozy atmosphere. In the center of the image, a meticulously detailed pool table dominates the foreground, balls scattered mid-game, cues resting on the side. To the right, mounted on a wood-paneled wall, is a classic dartboard with darts accurately placed, indicating an ongoing match. Around the pool table, suggest the presence of people through strategically placed, half-filled pint glasses and subtle, blurry background figures. The dartboard area also implies activity, with scoreboards faintly visible. The pub's interior includes traditional elements like dark wood furniture, brass fixtures, and patterned wallpaper. The overall composition should be balanced, drawing the eye towards the pool table and dartboard simultaneously, creating a visual mnemonic link to the question about traditional pub games. The image should evoke a sense of nostalgia and friendly competition, typical of a British pub setting, with a focus on Pool and Darts.
