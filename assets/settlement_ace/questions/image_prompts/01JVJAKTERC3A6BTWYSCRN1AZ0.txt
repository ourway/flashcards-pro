A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor painting in a pastel color palette (primarily blues, pinks, and whites) depicting a traditional British garden scene with a gazebo at its center. Two individuals, a young woman and a young man, stand within the gazebo, bathed in soft, diffused sunlight. The woman is holding a delicate bouquet of white roses. A pair of doves are perched on the gazebo's roof, facing each other. Around the gazebo, the garden is in full bloom, featuring iconic British flowers like lavender, roses, and bluebells. A winding path leads away from the gazebo, subtly suggesting a journey forward. The key element is the presence of two open, ornate birdcages placed slightly apart from each other on a small table within the gazebo, next to the couple. Both cages are empty, and a small key rests beside each cage. The expressions on the faces of the couple should be serene and thoughtful, conveying a sense of mutual respect and understanding. The overall composition should be balanced and harmonious, emphasizing the themes of freedom, choice, and mutual agreement within the context of a beautiful, idyllic British setting. The style should evoke a sense of classic British elegance and romance, reminiscent of a Jane Austen novel cover.
