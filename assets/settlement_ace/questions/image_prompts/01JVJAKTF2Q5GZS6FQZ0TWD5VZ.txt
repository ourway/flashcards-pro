A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Battle of Waterloo (16:9). The colour palette should be primarily pastel, with subtle hints of red, white, and blue echoing the UK flag. The central focus is on a dynamic clash between British and French soldiers amidst a muddy battlefield; British soldiers in red coats forming a steadfast line, repelling the advance of French infantry in blue uniforms. In the background, cannon smoke billows, partially obscuring the rolling hills of the Belgian countryside. The composition should convey the intensity and chaos of the battle, with horses rearing and soldiers locked in close combat. Subtle details include the iconic bicorne hat fallen on the ground, and a British flag (Union Jack) bravely waving amidst the turmoil. The overall feeling should be one of decisive victory, with a sense of finality to the conflict. The style should be reminiscent of historical battle paintings, with attention to realistic details in uniforms, weapons, and landscape. The image should evoke a sense of historical significance and the end of a major era of conflict between Great Britain and France.
