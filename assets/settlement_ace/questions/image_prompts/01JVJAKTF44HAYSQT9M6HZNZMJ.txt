A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour painting in a realistic style depicting three distinct landscapes seamlessly merging into one another, each representing Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The artwork should primarily utilize a pastel colour palette, subtly incorporating the red, white, and blue of the UK flag in varying shades. The central focus of the image is a stylized, interconnected engine composed of natural elements from each region. For Wales, a dragon-shaped gear crafted from slate drives a portion of the engine. For Scotland, a thistle-etched piston powered by a loch scene provides energy. For Northern Ireland, a shamrock-adorned dynamo, charged by a field of flax flowers, contributes to the overall power. The engine's framework is built from ancient Celtic knotwork, symbolizing the shared history and interwoven cultures of these regions. Light pastel blues and greens dominate the Scottish section, with heather and rolling hills in the background. The Welsh portion features gentle red hues in the form of poppies scattered across the landscape, with Snowdonia visible in the distance. The Northern Irish segment showcases soft whites and greens, with rolling green hills and the Giant's Causeway in the background. The sky above is a serene blend of pastel blues and whites, suggesting a bright, hopeful future powered by regional autonomy. The composition should give the impression of interconnectedness and harmonious collaboration, with each region's contribution vital to the engine's overall function.
