A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, ratio 16:9. The central image depicts King Charles I seated on a throne, rendered in pastel blues and creams. He wears a regal but simple crown, emphasizing his perceived divine authority. His posture is aloof and detached, with his gaze directed upwards, suggesting a focus on the heavens rather than his earthly kingdom. The throne room setting is opulent yet sparsely populated, subtly conveying isolation. Dominating the background is a large, ornate window, its panes forming a distorted reflection of the Houses of Parliament, which are rendered in muted grey tones. The distortion symbolizes Charles I's disregard for parliamentary authority. Sunlight streams through the window, illuminating the king but casting long shadows that stretch towards the foreground, hinting at the consequences of his actions. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, creams, and greys, echoing the colors of the UK flag while maintaining a somber, reflective mood. The entire composition aims to evoke a sense of Charles Iâ€™s self-imposed isolation and his belief in ruling independently, without the input or consent of Parliament, emphasizing the 'Divine Right of Kings' concept.
