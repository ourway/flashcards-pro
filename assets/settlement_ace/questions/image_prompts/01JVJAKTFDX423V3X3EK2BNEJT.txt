A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape ratio depicting a sprawling, dimly lit Victorian-era factory interior. The colour palette leans towards muted, pastel blues, greys, and browns, evoking a sense of bleakness. Dominating the central composition are rows of large, clanking machinery with exposed gears and belts, rendered with intricate detail. Overcrowded around these machines are numerous figures of men, women, and children, their faces etched with exhaustion and grime. Their clothing is tattered and worn. A few figures are coughing, and one child is subtly bandaged. The scene should be filled with subtle atmospheric details: dust motes dancing in the weak light filtering through high, grimy windows, pools of oil on the floor, and steam emanating from the machines. The architecture of the factory is imposing and oppressive, with high ceilings and a sense of claustrophobia despite the large space. The overall impression is one of intense, unsafe labour, reflecting the very poor working conditions of the Industrial Revolution. The art style should be reminiscent of historical illustrations from the era, maintaining a sense of realism and avoiding any cartoonish elements. The image should be emotionally evocative, communicating the harsh realities of the time without being overly graphic or disturbing.
