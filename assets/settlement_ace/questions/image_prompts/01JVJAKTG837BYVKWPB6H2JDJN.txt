A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Henry VIII standing resolutely on the left. He is adorned in lavish royal attire, complete with a crown and a vibrant red robe trimmed with ermine. His expression is determined, and his gaze is fixed on a distant point. He holds a royal scepter in his right hand. On the right side of the image, a symbolic representation of the Pope is depicted. The Pope is not a literal figure but rather a stylized papal tiara resting atop a closed book, representing religious authority, and a set of scales tilted heavily to one side, symbolizing the refusal. A bold, thick, red line visually connects Henry VIII to the papal tiara, abruptly stopping halfway, signifying the break. This break leads to a small, budding rose, symbolizing the Church of England, emerging from the ground where the line stops. The background features a muted, pastel-colored landscape reminiscent of the English countryside, with rolling green hills and a softly clouded sky. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, pinks, and greens, accented by the rich red of Henry VIII's robe and the golden hue of his crown, subtly referencing the colors of the UK flag. The composition emphasizes the separation and the subsequent creation, visually narrating the establishment of the Church of England due to the Pope's refusal.
