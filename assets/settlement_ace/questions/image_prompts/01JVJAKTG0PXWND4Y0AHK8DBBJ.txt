A hand-drawn, realistic, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a balanced scale. On one side of the scale, rendered in soft pastel blue, is a stylized representation of the Houses of Parliament, symbolizing the UK government, public bodies, and courts. The architectural details of the Houses of Parliament should be accurate and recognizable, but softened with the watercolor effect. On the other side of the scale, rendered in soft pastel red, is a stylized illustration of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), represented by a rolled parchment scroll tied with a ribbon. The scroll has a faint, elegant seal on it. The scale itself is made of polished wood and brass, reflecting a sense of history and tradition. The background is a soft, graduated wash of pastel white, giving a sense of impartiality and justice. The composition should emphasize the balance between the UK government and the principles of the European Convention, symbolizing that the government, public bodies, and courts are required to adhere to these principles. The overall tone should be educational, calming, and reassuring, reinforcing the concept of legal balance and adherence to human rights conventions, even with a change in EU status.
