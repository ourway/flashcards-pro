A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a split scene, visually comparing Northern Ireland and Scotland. On the left side, representing Northern Ireland, is a stylized, simplified version of the Parliament Buildings at Stormont. The building is depicted in soft, pastel blue hues, with gentle light filtering through its windows. In front of the building, a small group of diverse figures is gathered, symbolizing the people of Northern Ireland and their participation in governance. On the right side, mirroring the composition, is a representation of the Scottish Parliament Building at Holyrood. This building is rendered in warmer, pastel reds and oranges, creating a visual contrast with the cool blues of the Northern Ireland side. Similarly, a diverse group of people is depicted in front of the Scottish Parliament, emphasizing Scotland's active participation in its own governance. A delicate, almost invisible line divides the two scenes, reinforcing the idea of separate but equal governing bodies. Above both scenes, a gentle, overarching rainbow in pastel colors connects the two sides, symbolizing the unity of the United Kingdom despite regional differences. The overall style is realistic yet soft, avoiding harsh lines and favoring a gentle, educational aesthetic. The colors are inspired by the UK flag but rendered in a pastel palette, creating a calming and memorable visual.
