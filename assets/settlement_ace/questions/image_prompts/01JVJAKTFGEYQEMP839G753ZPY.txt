A hand-drawn, realistic, watercolor-style image in pastel colors (primarily light blues, soft reds, and whites) depicting the iconic BBC Broadcasting House in London. The building should be centrally framed in a 16:9 landscape ratio. In the foreground, subtly floating just above the ground level, is a stylized, oversized television license card resembling a credit card. The card is primarily blue, with a red stripe across the top mimicking the Union Jack colors. Instead of a name, the words "The Beeb" are elegantly calligraphed in white across the card. A gentle beam of light emanates from the card, subtly illuminating the BBC building. The overall atmosphere should be one of calm and support, visually linking the license card directly to the broadcasting house. The sky is a soft, gradient blend of light blue and white, suggesting a bright, clear day. The architectural details of the building should be accurate, but rendered in a softened, artistic style to avoid harsh lines. The color palette should evoke a sense of British heritage and trustworthiness, while the light beam symbolizes the flow of funds and support provided by the TV license revenue, benefiting the BBC.
