A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant rugby match, viewed from a slightly elevated angle of the center of the field. The composition is centered to emphasize the key elements. Six distinct national flags—England (St. George's Cross), Scotland (St. Andrew's Cross), Wales (Red Dragon), Ireland (Green, White, and Orange tricolor), France (Blue, White, and Red tricolor), and Italy (Green, White, and Red tricolor)—are subtly incorporated as banners fluttering gently in the background, lining the rugby pitch. The rugby players are wearing jerseys in colors that subtly allude to the six nations (red, white, blue, green, orange), without explicitly displaying national emblems on their uniforms. The players are engaged in a dynamic scrum, showcasing the intensity of the competition. The field itself is a lush green, with meticulously detailed blades of grass. The sky above is a soft pastel blue, reminiscent of a clear spring day in the UK. The overall color palette leans towards the colors of the UK flag—red, white, and blue—but softened into pastel shades to create a calming and educational atmosphere. The style is realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and emphasizing accurate anatomical details for the players and realistic textures for the field and flags.
