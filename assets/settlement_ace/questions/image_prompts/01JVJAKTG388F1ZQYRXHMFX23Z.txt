A serene, watercolor landscape depicting the Scottish Highlands. The scene focuses on a gentle, rolling hillside bathed in soft, pastel hues of blues, greens, and purples, mirroring the colors of the Scottish landscape. In the foreground, a small family, dressed in traditional highland attire in muted colors, is peacefully walking away from their modest stone cottage, their faces showing a mix of sadness and resignation. They are not being forced or chased; their posture is calm and deliberate. The cottage is simple, with a thatched roof and a small garden. Behind them, the landscape transitions to reveal a flock of sheep grazing peacefully on the hills. The sheep are white with light brown faces. The overall composition emphasizes the quiet displacement of the people and the gradual conversion of the land to pasture. The sky is a soft, overcast grey, contributing to the somber yet peaceful mood. The art style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and realism, avoiding any cartoonish or exaggerated features. The focus is on the peaceful transition and the lack of violent conflict or rebellion, reinforcing the "False" answer to the question about slave rebellion.
