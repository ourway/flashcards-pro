A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the Concorde supersonic jet, rendered in a realistic style with pastel colors. The Concorde is the central focus, soaring horizontally across the frame against a backdrop subtly divided into two distinct halves. The left half of the backdrop represents Britain: rolling green hills dotted with quintessential English cottages, a faint outline of the white cliffs of Dover in the distance, and a wisp of clouds subtly forming the shape of the Union Jack. The right half of the backdrop represents France: lavender fields in Provence, a distant view of the Eiffel Tower, and a similarly subtle cloud formation hinting at the French Tricolore flag. The Concorde itself should have a polished, gleaming surface reflecting both the British and French landscapes, symbolizing the partnership. The contrails left by the Concorde should subtly intertwine, further emphasizing the collaborative effort. The overall color palette should be dominated by soft blues, greens, lavenders, and whites, evoking a sense of elegance and historical partnership. The art style should be reminiscent of classic travel posters, with a focus on detail and accuracy, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements.
