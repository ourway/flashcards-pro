A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting two distinct scenes side-by-side, against a soft, pastel blue background reminiscent of the Scottish flag's hue. On the left, a scene representing Scotland: a proud, kilted bagpiper stands on a rolling green hill dotted with thistles, the national flower. He plays his bagpipes with gusto, and behind him, a faint silhouette of Saint Andrew's cross (the Saltire) is visible in the sky, formed by wisps of clouds. The colours are mainly blues, greens, and purples. On the right, a scene representing Northern Ireland: a group of people cheerfully dance a traditional Irish jig in a village square. A banner adorned with shamrocks (a symbol of Northern Ireland) flutters overhead, and in the distance, the rolling hills of the Antrim coast are visible. The colours are mainly greens, whites, and oranges. A very subtle, thin, pale grey line divides the two scenes, emphasizing their separateness yet simultaneous existence within the United Kingdom. The overall composition should convey a sense of cultural pride and celebration, highlighting that Scotland and Northern Ireland uniquely observe their patron saint's day as an official holiday, using visual cues to differentiate them from the rest of the UK. The art style should be akin to a detailed, yet gentle, travel poster.
