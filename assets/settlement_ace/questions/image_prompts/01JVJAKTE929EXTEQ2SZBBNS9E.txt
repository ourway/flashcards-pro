A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration, ratio 16:9. At the center, a grand, stylized oak tree, its trunk thick and sturdy, symbolizing the United Kingdom. Four distinct branches extend outwards, each representing one of the devolved administrations: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Each branch is adorned with leaves unique to its region: English roses, Scottish thistles, Welsh daffodils, and Northern Irish shamrocks, respectively. Beneath each branch, a group of figures dressed in smart, professional attire, representing civil servants, are diligently working, seemingly managing documents and attending to tasks specific to their region. The figures under the Scottish branch are surrounded by imagery of lochs and mountains, the Welsh figures by rolling green hills and sheep, the Northern Irish figures by coastal landscapes, and the English figures by iconic landmarks like castles and cathedrals. The colors should be a pastel palette, with hints of red, white, and blue subtly woven into the landscapes and attire, echoing the UK flag without being overtly patriotic. The sky in the background is a soft, watercolor wash of blues and greys, reminiscent of the often overcast British weather. The overall composition should convey a sense of organized autonomy, illustrating that while the UK is unified, each devolved administration manages its own affairs with its own dedicated civil service. The style should be realistic and detailed, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, ensuring the image is both informative and aesthetically pleasing.
