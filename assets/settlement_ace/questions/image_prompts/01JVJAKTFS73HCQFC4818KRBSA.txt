A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image depicting a semi-circular council chamber, bathed in soft, pastel light, reminiscent of a dawn over the English countryside. Forty-seven stylized, individual chairs are arranged around a central, round table. Each chair is subtly different, suggesting diverse representation, and crafted from a light oak wood. On each chair rests a uniquely designed, miniature flag representing a European nation. The flags are designed in a realistic style and are easily recognizable. At the center of the round table sits a single, unlit candle within an ornate silver candlestick, symbolizing unity and hope. The backdrop of the chamber is a large, arched window revealing a serene landscape of rolling green hills dotted with wildflowers. The sky is a pastel blue, fading into a gentle rose color on the horizon. Above the window, a stylized, hand-painted banner displays a circle of twelve golden stars, subtly referencing the European flag, but without explicitly replicating it. The overall composition should feel balanced and harmonious, with a slight emphasis on the chairs to highlight the number 47. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, greens, and golds, creating a calming and inviting atmosphere that evokes a sense of European cooperation and shared heritage. Each element is rendered with realistic detail, avoiding cartoonish or abstract interpretations.
