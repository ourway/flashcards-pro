A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style (not cartoonish), depicting a solitary figure of a young man, Hamlet, standing on a stark, rocky promontory overlooking a turbulent, grey sea under a brooding sky. The colour palette should be pastel. Hamlet is dressed in traditional, dark Renaissance attire, a flowing black cloak partially obscuring a pale blue tunic. In his right hand, he holds a skull, rendered with careful anatomical accuracy, its empty eye sockets gazing out towards the viewer. His left hand is raised slightly, palm upwards, in a gesture of contemplation. The wind whips his long, dark hair across his face, partially obscuring his features but conveying a sense of inner turmoil. The promontory is barren, save for a few gnarled, wind-swept trees clinging to the rocks. The sea below is a swirling mass of dark blues and greys, with white-capped waves crashing against the base of the cliffs. The overall composition should evoke a sense of melancholy and introspection. The sky is a blend of muted greys and blues, hinting at an impending storm. The light source should be a diffused, overcast glow, casting long, dramatic shadows. The image should be framed in a 16:9 ratio, with Hamlet positioned slightly off-center to the left, emphasizing the vastness of the landscape and the weight of his existential dilemma. The entire scene should convey a sense of timelessness and the universal struggle with mortality and meaning.
