A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Stormont Parliament Buildings in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The building should be positioned centrally, occupying the main focus of the 16:9 landscape format. The sky above should be a swirling mix of deep blues, greys, and whites, suggestive of a brewing storm (hinting at 'Storm'ont). Lightning forks dramatically from the clouds, illuminating the building with flashes of stark white light. The architecture of Stormont should be rendered with high accuracy, showcasing its neo-classical style, light stone facade, and prominent dome. Around the building, the lush green landscape of the Stormont Estate should be visible, with trees swaying slightly in the implied wind. In the foreground, a symbolic, weathered stone path leads towards the entrance of the building. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel blues, greys, and greens, mirroring the UK flag's colours while maintaining a soft, educational aesthetic. The illustration should evoke a sense of both the grandeur of the building and the sometimes turbulent political atmosphere associated with it, without depicting any people or text. The light should be dramatic, emphasizing the architectural details and the stormy weather.
