A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a melancholic, yet thoughtful, depiction of Hamlet. He is dressed in Renaissance attire, primarily in deep blues and blacks with subtle white ruffles at the collar and cuffs. He stands in a dimly lit, imagined scene of Elsinore Castle, suggested by arched stone windows in the background. In his hands, he gently holds a human skull, gazing at it with a pensive expression. The skull appears aged and slightly cracked, with subtle earth tones and ivory hues. Light streams in from the unseen windows, illuminating Hamletâ€™s face and the skull, creating a dramatic contrast. The colour palette leans heavily on pastel blues, greys, and creams, reminiscent of the UK flag's colours but softened. Subtle symbolic elements are included, such as a single wilting rose lying on the stone floor near Hamlet's feet, representing mortality and lost love. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of contemplation, tragedy, and the weight of existential questions, capturing the essence of Shakespeare's Hamlet. The background is blurred slightly to keep the focus on Hamlet and the skull.
