A watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a serene, pastel-coloured British countryside scene under a soft, overcast sky. In the foreground, a gently winding path leads towards a small, stone-built church nestled amongst rolling green hills. The path is lined with budding spring flowers in pale blues, pinks, and yellows, subtly echoing the colours of the Union Jack. A solitary figure, rendered in muted tones, walks slowly along the path, head bowed slightly in contemplation. The figure carries a small, empty basket, symbolizing sacrifice and reflection. Above the church, forty small, dove-shaped clouds drift lazily across the sky, arranged in a loose formation. These clouds are subtly lighter in colour than the sky, giving them an ethereal quality. The overall composition should evoke a sense of quiet introspection and the passage of time, with the path representing the journey of self-reflection during the forty days. The church represents Easter at the end of this journey. The pastel colour palette and the realistic watercolour style should create a calming and memorable image, helping the viewer associate the visual elements with the concept of Lent as a period of reflection and sacrifice before Easter. The image should be 16:9 in ratio and landscape oriented with the church and path in the center.
