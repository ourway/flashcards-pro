A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the signing of a treaty in 1921. The scene is set in a grand, yet somber, room reminiscent of early 20th-century architecture. Dominating the center is a long, polished mahogany table around which several distinguished figures are seated and standing. The figures are dressed in formal attire of the era: dark suits, ties, and stern expressions. The British representatives are identifiable by subtle visual cues alluding to their nationality, such as pocket watches, and perhaps a hint of tweed in their clothing. Across from them, the Irish delegation displays similar formality but with subtle green accents in their attire, a visual nod to Ireland. The focus is on the treaty itself, a parchment document lying open on the table, illuminated by soft light filtering through a stained-glass window featuring a Celtic knot design. In the background, a subtle depiction of the Irish landscape, a rolling green hill with a distant coastline, is visible through a window, symbolizing the land for which independence is being negotiated. The color palette leans towards pastel shades of green, gold, and muted blues, with accents of deep red in the upholstery and flags (UK and early Irish flag) subtly placed in the background, creating a harmonious and historically evocative image. The overall impression is one of a momentous occasion, a visual representation of the treaty granting independence, designed to reinforce the "True" answer to the question.
