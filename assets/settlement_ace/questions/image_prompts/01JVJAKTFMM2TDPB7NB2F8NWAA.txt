A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, rendered in a pastel color palette. The composition centers on the iconic London Eye, depicted as a majestic, pastel-blue Ferris wheel. The London Eye is positioned prominently in the center of the frame, with intricate details showcasing its latticework structure and the individual passenger capsules. Below the London Eye, the River Thames flows horizontally across the frame, reflecting the pastel hues of the sky. The river's surface is subtly rippled to suggest movement, with gentle highlights catching the light. The southern bank of the Thames is depicted with a soft, grassy embankment, lined with stylized, pastel-colored buildings representing the architecture along the river. In the background, a suggestion of the London skyline fades into a misty, pastel-pink horizon, with the faint outlines of landmarks. The overall mood is serene and educational, emphasizing the London Eye's location on the Thames' southern bank through the composition and color scheme. No text or numbers are included. The image should be 16:9 landscape ratio.
