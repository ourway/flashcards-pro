A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a vintage academic illustration. The scene is dominated by a central figure resembling Adam Smith, depicted in the attire of the 18th century, complete with a powdered wig and formal coat. He is seated at a sturdy wooden desk, bathed in soft, diffused light emanating from a tall window to his left. The desk is covered with quill pens, inkwells, and stacks of parchment. In the foreground, spilling from an overflowing treasure chest made of dark wood and reinforced with iron bands, are an abundance of gold coins, jewels, and precious metals. These riches are not chaotic but arranged to subtly form abstract, rising bar graphs, symbolizing economic growth and wealth accumulation. Behind Smith, a large, open book rests on a lectern; its pages contain intricate diagrams illustrating concepts such as supply and demand curves and circular flow models, rendered in fine lines and pastel shades of blue and red. The background features a stylized representation of a bustling 18th-century marketplace, with ships visible in the harbor beyond, suggesting international trade. Dominant colors are pastel blues, reds, and golds, aiming to evoke a sense of historical significance and intellectual pursuit. The overall composition should evoke a sense of enlightenment and the birth of economic thought.
