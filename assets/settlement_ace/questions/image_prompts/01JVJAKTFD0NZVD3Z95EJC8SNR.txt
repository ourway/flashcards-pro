A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a somber scene within a Tudor-era English castle, rendered in a pastel color palette dominated by muted reds, blues, and creams. The central focus is a grand, arched doorway framed by heavy stone walls. Emerging from the darkness within the doorway is a single, crimson-stained Tudor rose, its petals appearing as if delicately brushed with blood. The rose is not overly graphic but symbolically represents the 'Bloody' aspect of Mary I's nickname. In the foreground, subtle shadows of kneeling figures, barely visible, suggest individuals in prayer or supplication. These figures represent the persecuted Protestants. The overall composition should evoke a sense of foreboding and suppressed fear. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a melancholic atmosphere. The architectural details of the castle should be accurate and historically consistent. The image should be 16:9 with the rose and doorway in the center of the image. The style avoids cartoonish or abstract representation, focusing on a realistic and historically informed depiction. The colors used should represent the UK flag, using red, white/cream and blue.
