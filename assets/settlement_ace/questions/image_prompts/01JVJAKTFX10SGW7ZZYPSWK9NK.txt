A meticulously detailed watercolor painting depicting a scenic cross-section of the UK mainland, stretching horizontally across a 16:9 canvas. The left side of the image features a representation of John O'Groats, Scotland: a rugged, windswept coastline with a quaint lighthouse perched atop a cliff, waves crashing against the rocks below, and a flock of seabirds circling overhead. Subtle hues of blue, gray, and green dominate this area, reflecting the northern climate. Progressing eastward across the image, the landscape transitions into rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep, symbolizing the Scottish Highlands. The central portion of the image showcases the English countryside, with patchwork fields of wheat and barley in warm yellows and browns, interspersed with traditional stone villages and meandering rivers. A subtle, winding road cuts through the landscape, suggesting the long journey. The right side of the image culminates in Land's End, Cornwall: dramatic cliffs plunging into the turquoise sea, a picturesque coastline with sandy beaches, and a lone sailboat on the horizon. The colors here are warmer and brighter, reflecting the southwestern climate. A pastel color palette is preferred, with a soft, dreamlike quality. The overall composition should evoke a sense of vastness and geographical diversity, capturing the essence of the UK's landscape from north to south. The image should be hand-drawn in a realistic style, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements.
