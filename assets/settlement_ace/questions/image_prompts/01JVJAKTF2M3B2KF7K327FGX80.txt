A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration depicting a stylized Tudor rose, split vertically into two distinct halves, set against a backdrop reminiscent of the English countryside. The left half of the rose showcases deep crimson petals, representing the House of Lancaster, while the right half displays pristine white petals, symbolizing the House of York. Each half should appear vibrant and realistically textured. In the immediate background, behind the rose, faded and blurred imagery of medieval knights clashing in battle can be seen. The ground beneath the rose is slightly uneven, subtly suggesting a battlefield. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of red, white, and green, with hints of gold to accentuate the regal nature of the warring houses. A subtle visual element should be that the white rose is slowly overtaking the red rose, hinting at York's eventual triumph. The composition should be centered, with the divided rose as the focal point, drawing the viewer's eye immediately. The art style should mimic historical tapestries, with a touch of realism, avoiding overly modern or cartoonish features. The image should evoke a sense of history and conflict, visually anchoring the War of the Roses in the viewer's mind, implicitly suggesting a date earlier than 1485 through the fading background battle scene. The landscape in the background should feature rolling green hills dotted with iconic English trees, such as oak, reinforcing the UK context.
