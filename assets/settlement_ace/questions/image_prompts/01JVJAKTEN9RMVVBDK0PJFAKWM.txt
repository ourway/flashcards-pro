A vibrant, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration depicting a festive St. Patrick's Day celebration in Northern Ireland. The scene is set in a quaint, idealized village square, reminiscent of a postcard, with buildings rendered in soft pastel colours, predominantly greens, creams, and touches of light blue, evoking the Irish countryside and the colours of the UK flag. The central focus is a lively parade, with people dressed in traditional Irish attire, including green hats, coats, and kilts, joyfully marching and playing traditional instruments like fiddles and bodhr√°ns. Shamrocks are abundant, adorning clothing, flags, and even subtly integrated into the architectural details of the buildings. A group of children are gleefully chasing after bubbles, some of which are filled with glittery green shamrocks. A rainbow arches gracefully across the sky in the background, ending near a pot of gold subtly hinted at by a golden glow, symbolizing the luck of the Irish. The overall atmosphere is one of joyous celebration, community, and Irish pride, with a sense of historical charm and cultural richness. The style should be realistic but with a light, whimsical touch, as if from a beautifully illustrated children's book, using soft lighting and gentle shading to create a warm and inviting scene.
