A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical legal document, depicting a grand, yet inviting, courtroom scene in the United Kingdom. The color palette should be dominated by pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly echoing the Union Jack. The focal point is a stylized, ornate golden key, labeled with the faint, elegant script "Habeas Corpus" which should be almost unreadable, resting gently on top of a law book placed on the judge's bench. The courtroom features classic British architectural details: arched windows allowing soft, diffused light to illuminate the space, dark wood paneling reaching halfway up the walls, and the UK flag displayed discreetly in the background. The benches for the public are partially filled with diverse, respectful figures, symbolizing the universality of the right. No faces should be clearly visible. The scene should evoke a sense of justice, fairness, and historical significance, reminding the viewer of the fundamental right to a court hearing upheld by the Habeas Corpus Act. The overall composition should be centered and balanced, drawing the eye to the golden key as the key element linking the legal concept to the court setting. The image must be strictly 2D, with no text or numbers visible within the artwork itself.
