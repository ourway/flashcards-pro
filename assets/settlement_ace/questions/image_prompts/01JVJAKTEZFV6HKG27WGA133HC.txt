A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vibrant shamrock plant, its three heart-shaped leaves a lush, pastel green, occupying the central space of a 16:9 landscape composition. The shamrock is potted in a rustic, earthenware pot, subtly adorned with a faint Celtic knot pattern etched into its surface. The background features a soft, diffused light suggesting an overcast Northern Irish day, with gentle hints of rolling green hills in the far distance. Delicate droplets of morning dew cling to the shamrock's leaves, catching the light and adding a touch of realism. The color palette leans heavily on pastel greens and earthy browns, with subtle hints of blue and white in the sky, evoking the colors of the UK flag in a muted, harmonious way. The overall composition is clean and uncluttered, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the shamrock, symbolizing Northern Ireland. The art style should evoke a sense of natural beauty and tranquility, reminiscent of classic botanical illustrations. The lighting should be soft and diffused, highlighting the intricate details of the shamrock's leaves and the texture of the earthenware pot.
