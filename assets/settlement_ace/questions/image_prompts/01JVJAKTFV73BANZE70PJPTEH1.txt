A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical maritime paintings. The image, in a 16:9 landscape format, depicts a vast armada of Spanish galleons sailing upon a turbulent, dark blue sea. The galleons are arranged in a formidable formation, stretching across the horizon, with billowing white sails adorned with the Spanish flag's red and yellow colors. Each ship is rendered with acute attention to detail, showcasing the intricate rigging, ornate carvings, and imposing cannons. The sky above is a dramatic blend of stormy greys and blues, with rays of sunlight piercing through the clouds, illuminating the lead galleon. The overall color palette leans towards deep blues, greys, and the vibrant reds and yellows of the Spanish flags, evoking a sense of historical drama and naval power. The composition emphasizes the sheer scale and number of ships, creating a visual representation of a "large fleet of ships." The waves are high and foamy, suggesting the challenges faced by the armada. The overall style should evoke a sense of awe and historical significance, capturing the essence of a powerful, seafaring nation.
