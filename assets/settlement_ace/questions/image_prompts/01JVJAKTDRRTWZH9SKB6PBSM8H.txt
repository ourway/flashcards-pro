A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a stylized, pastel-coloured Tudor rose, its petals subtly unfurling to reveal six distinct miniature wedding scenes within. Each scene depicts a different wedding between King Henry VIII and one of his wives. Each scene should be painted in a different pastel colour, following the rhyme "divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived". The first petal scene (divorced) shows Henry VIII with Catherine of Aragon in a wedding setting, with a scroll depicting a divorce decree subtly visible in the background. The second petal scene (beheaded) shows Henry VIII with Anne Boleyn, but with a faint, symbolic axe laid on the side. The third petal scene (died) depicts Henry VIII with Jane Seymour, with a subtle indication of a mourning veil or sombre colours in the scene. The fourth petal scene (divorced) portrays Henry VIII with Anne of Cleves, again with a scroll indicating divorce. The fifth petal (beheaded) shows Henry VIII with Catherine Howard and a very faint axe. The final petal (survived) shows Henry VIII with Catherine Parr, depicted in a peaceful garden setting, with the sun shining on the scene. The background is a soft, blended wash of pastel blues and pinks, evoking a sense of historical romance and intrigue. The overall composition aims for a balance between historical accuracy and artistic interpretation, focusing on visual storytelling to aid memory retention. The style is reminiscent of classical portraiture and illuminated manuscripts, using soft lighting and delicate brushstrokes.
