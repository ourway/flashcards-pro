A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the Houses of Parliament. The Palace of Westminster is bisected vertically. On the left side, representing the House of Commons, a robust, intricately detailed steam engine dominates. The engine is painted in hues of vibrant red and deep blues, with brass fixtures gleaming under the light. The engine's pistons are actively pumping, symbolizing the driving force of legislation. The engine is connected to a large, ornate wheel that is actively turning. On the right side, representing the House of Lords, a stately, yet somewhat stationary, hot air balloon is depicted. The balloon is rendered in soft pastel blues and creams, with intricate gold filigree adorning its basket. The balloon is tethered to the ground with elegant ropes, implying a sense of oversight and review rather than direct propulsion. The overall scene is bathed in a soft, diffused light, suggesting a sense of historical weight and solemnity. The composition emphasizes the engine's powerful forward motion in contrast to the balloon's gentle hovering, visually representing the Commons' greater power. The background features a subtle, watercolor wash of the River Thames and the London skyline, rendered in muted, atmospheric tones. The Houses of Parliament are accurately portrayed in terms of their architectural details.
