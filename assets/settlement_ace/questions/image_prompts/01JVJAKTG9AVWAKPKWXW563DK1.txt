A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in a realistic style reminiscent of classic scientific illustrations, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a cross-section of a medieval-era cathedral under construction in England. The cathedral's architectural style blends Norman and early Gothic elements, reflecting the period when German engineers were influential. The colour palette is predominantly pastel, with subtle hints of red, white, and blue inspired by the UK flag. The foreground shows a group of figures, including English stonemasons and what appear to be German engineers. The German engineers are subtly distinguished by their clothing and tools, which are characteristic of medieval German craftsmanship. One German engineer is pointing at a complex pulley system used for lifting large stones, while another is examining a blueprint or technical drawing. The pulley system is rendered with intricate detail, showcasing the advanced engineering knowledge of the time. Behind the construction scene, a stylized, rolling landscape stretches into the distance, featuring a faint silhouette of a German cityscape with traditional half-timbered houses and church spires on one side, and the rolling hills of the English countryside on the other. The sky is a soft, pastel blue with wispy clouds, and the overall lighting suggests a bright, crisp day, emphasizing the industrious atmosphere of the construction site. The overall image should convey a sense of collaboration and the transfer of knowledge between cultures, highlighting Germany's significant contribution to engineering in the Middle Ages.
