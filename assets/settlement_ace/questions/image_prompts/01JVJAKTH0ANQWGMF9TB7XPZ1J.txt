A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical courtroom sketches. The color palette leans heavily on pastel blues and reds, subtly echoing the UK flag. The central focus is a grand, imposing courtroom scene within a Scottish castle. Dominating the composition is a stern-looking judge in traditional robes and a powdered wig, seated on an elevated bench crafted from dark, polished wood. Before him stands a barrister, passionately delivering a closing argument, his face etched with determination. The courtroom is packed with onlookers, their faces a mix of anxiety, curiosity, and solemnity. High above, stained-glass windows depict Scottish historical figures, casting colorful patterns onto the scene. The overall atmosphere is one of gravity and importance, emphasizing the high stakes nature of the proceedings. The background subtly features elements of the Scottish landscape visible through the courtroom windows, such as rolling hills and a loch, grounding the scene in its specific geographic and cultural context. The lighting is dramatic, with shafts of light illuminating key figures and details, reinforcing the visual narrative of a place where justice is served for the most serious crimes.
