A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour painting in a realistic style, depicting the Scottish Parliament chamber during a lively debate. The color palette should primarily utilize pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag. The chamber is rendered with impressive architectural detail, showcasing its high ceilings, ornate woodwork, and rows of seating. Instead of the usual arrangement, the painting should emphasize the sparseness of the supposed 33 members. Only 33 distinct figures are scattered sparsely throughout the large chamber, some looking bored, others appearing isolated and lost in the vast space. Dominating the scene is a visual representation of Scotland's diversity: various figures representing different ethnicities, ages, and backgrounds are depicted looking on with expressions of disappointment and frustration. A single bagpipe lies discarded on one of the empty benches, symbolizing the underrepresentation of Scottish culture and the feeling of something missing. The composition should focus on the emptiness of the room and the diverse crowd in the background, highlighting the inadequate number of representatives. The overall impression should be one of incompleteness and a clear visual statement that 33 members are insufficient for a vibrant and representative parliament.
