A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a bustling polling station in 1928 London. The scene is filled with diverse women, elegantly dressed in flapper dresses and cloche hats of varying pastel colors (primarily blues, pinks, and creams), confidently casting their votes. The polling station is adorned with subtle British motifs, such as stylized roses and thistles subtly integrated into the architectural details. A suffragette banner, rendered in soft blues and reds, hangs discreetly in the background, its message implied rather than explicitly shown, referencing the long struggle for women's suffrage. The overall atmosphere is one of empowerment and progress, bathed in a soft, warm light suggestive of a hopeful new era. The architectural style of the polling station should be reminiscent of the art deco movement, popular in the 1920s, with geometric patterns subtly incorporated into the design. The color palette should be primarily pastel with accents of red and blue, reflecting the British flag, and conveying a sense of historical significance and gentle optimism. The composition should focus on the act of voting, with the women as the central figures, emphasizing their active participation in the democratic process. The entire image must be strictly 2D, with no 3D elements present and no text anywhere in the image. The image ratio should be 16:9, and the main subject should be in the center.
