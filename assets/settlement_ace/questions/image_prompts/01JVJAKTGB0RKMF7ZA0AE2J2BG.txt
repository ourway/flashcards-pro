A watercolour painting in a realistic style, depicting a panoramic view of the Scottish Highlands in winter. Dominating the centre of the 16:9 frame are five distinct snow-covered mountain peaks, each representing one of Scotland's ski centres. Each peak has a clearly visible ski resort with tiny skiers. The sky is a soft, pastel blue, fading to a light grey near the horizon. The foreground features a snow-covered valley with a winding road leading towards the mountains. The overall colour palette consists of pastel blues, whites, and greys, with subtle hints of the UK flag colours (red and blue) incorporated through the attire of the tiny skiers â€“ some wear red jackets and others blue. The composition should emphasize the vastness of the Scottish Highlands and the distinct presence of the five ski centres, with attention to details like snow texture and the rocky faces of the mountains. The style should evoke a sense of calm and beauty, highlighting the natural landscape and the recreational opportunities it offers. The hand-drawn quality should be evident, with visible brushstrokes and subtle variations in colour to create a sense of depth and realism.
