A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical tapestry. The scene is set against a backdrop of the Welsh and English countrysides merging seamlessly. On the left, rolling green hills of Wales dotted with sheep and traditional stone cottages. On the right, the lush, manicured fields of England, complete with a classic English manor house in the distance. Dominating the center is a stylized, artistic representation of a Tudor Rose (England's national flower) intertwined with a Welsh Daffodil (Wales' national flower). The stems of the flowers are bound together with a ribbon coloured with the UK flag (red, white, and blue). Above the floral union, a stylized, regal crown hovers, subtly suggesting royal authority and unity. The colours should be primarily pastel shades of green, gold, and white, with the red, white, and blue ribbon adding a pop of colour, alluding to the UK flag. The overall style should evoke a sense of historical significance, using soft lighting and delicate brushstrokes to create a visually appealing and memorable image that symbolizes the union of England and Wales during the Tudor period. The composition should be symmetrical and balanced, with the central floral union being the focal point, drawing the viewer's eye and reinforcing the concept of unification.
