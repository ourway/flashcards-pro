A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, depicting a moonlit scene in London on a cold November night. The Houses of Parliament stand majestically in the background, their gothic architecture rendered with exquisite detail. In the foreground, a shadowy figure, reminiscent of Guy Fawkes, is kneeling near a pile of wooden barrels, which are subtly marked with a faint, almost imperceptible gunpowder texture. A single, flickering lantern casts an eerie glow on his face, highlighting a mixture of determination and anxiety. The color palette is primarily dark blues and grays, evoking the somber atmosphere of the night, accented by the warm, inviting golden light emanating from a few windows in the Parliament building. Wisps of fog curl around the base of the building, adding to the suspenseful ambiance. The overall composition should be slightly tilted upwards, emphasizing the imposing scale of the Houses of Parliament and the magnitude of the planned event. The image should aim to capture the historical significance and dramatic tension of the Gunpowder Plot, while remaining visually appealing and educational. The style should be reminiscent of classical historical illustrations, with an emphasis on accurate architectural details and realistic portrayal of the characters and setting. The ratio should be 16:9, and the main subject should be in the center of the image.
