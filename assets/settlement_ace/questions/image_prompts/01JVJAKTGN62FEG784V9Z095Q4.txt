A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the London Eye as a central focal point against a soft, pastel-colored London skyline at twilight. The sky transitions from a pale blue at the top to a gentle lavender near the horizon. The London Eye itself is subtly illuminated, with each capsule gently glowing. The capsules should be filled with diverse groups of people, their silhouettes visible against the soft light. The Thames River flows gently in the foreground, reflecting the lights of the city and the London Eye, creating a mirrored effect. The Houses of Parliament and Big Ben are visible in the background, rendered in soft pastel shades of beige and grey. Incorporate subtle, almost ethereal, wisps of light emanating from the London Eye, symbolizing the dawning of a new era and the celebration of the millennium. The overall composition should evoke a sense of wonder, optimism, and historical significance, with the pastel color palette contributing to a peaceful and reflective mood. The painting should aim for a realistic portrayal while maintaining a delicate and artistic touch, ensuring it is visually appealing and memorable. The image ratio is 16:9.
