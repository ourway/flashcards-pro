A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a miniature courtroom scene, adhering to a 16:9 aspect ratio. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel shades, subtly incorporating red, white, and blue hues reminiscent of the UK flag. The courtroom is rendered with soft, diffused lighting, giving it a gentle, approachable atmosphere. The central focus is a small wooden table where two figures, depicted as average citizens rather than lawyers, are engaged in a civil, calm discussion. One figure gestures amicably, while the other listens attentively. The table holds a single, diminutive gavel made of polished wood. Behind them, a judge sits at a slightly elevated bench, also rendered in miniature scale, with a kindly, impartial expression. The courtroom itself is modestly sized, with simple, unadorned walls, suggesting a setting focused on efficiency and accessibility. Symbolic elements should include a scales of justice rendered in a delicate, almost whimsical style, placed subtly in the background, indicating fairness and equity. The overall composition should convey the idea of a simplified, approachable legal process designed for minor disputes, emphasizing the "small" aspect of the "small claims procedure". The illustration should evoke a sense of ease and resolution rather than intimidation or complexity.
