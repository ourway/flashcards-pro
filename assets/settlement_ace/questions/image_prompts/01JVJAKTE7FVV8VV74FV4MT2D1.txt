A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a sturdy, symbolic British oak tree, its roots representing the UK's foundational laws and principles. The tree's trunk is thick and unwavering, colored in muted, earthy tones. Three prominent branches extend outwards, each bearing a symbolic representation of a key sector: A stylized passport, symbolizing immigration, a globe encircled by doves, representing foreign affairs, and a treasure chest overflowing with gold coins, representing taxation. Each of these branches is deliberately depicted as being pruned or trimmed back, with gardening shears hovering nearby but not actively cutting, implying a limit to their growth and influence. Above the oak tree, a grand, classical-style building reminiscent of the Houses of Parliament is depicted, bathed in a soft, golden light, symbolizing the central UK government. Fine, delicate lines emphasize the architectural details of the building. The sky is a blend of pastel blues and whites, reminiscent of a clear British summer day. The overall color palette leans towards the red, white, and blue of the UK flag, but in pastel shades to create a sense of calm authority and educational clarity. The composition should evoke a feeling of established order and a clear hierarchy of power, visually reinforcing that certain high-level matters remain under the purview of the central government.
