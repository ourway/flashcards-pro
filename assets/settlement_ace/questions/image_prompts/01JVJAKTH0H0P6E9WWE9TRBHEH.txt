A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting King Henry VIII standing in a grand, sunlit English garden. He is portrayed in his iconic Tudor attire: a richly embroidered doublet in deep crimson and gold, a fur-trimmed cloak, and a jeweled crown resting upon his head. In his right hand, he holds a freshly bloomed, vibrant red rose, symbolizing England, while his left hand rests upon a partially drawn architectural blueprint depicting the early designs of a church building. The rose is depicted with meticulous detail, each petal individually rendered. In the background, partially obscured by flowering bushes, is a faint depiction of the Pope inside a Vatican window, looking displeased. The garden itself is lush and verdant, with classic English flowers in full bloom â€“ roses, lavender, and foxgloves, painted in soft, pastel hues. The architectural plans in Henry's hand include subtle design elements that hint at a blend of traditional Catholic architecture and early Anglican styles. The overall color palette leans towards reds, golds, and greens, with soft blues in the sky above, subtly referencing the Union Jack colors. The composition should be centered, with Henry VIII as the focal point, the garden providing a serene and regal backdrop. The image should evoke a sense of historical significance and the monumental shift in religious power that occurred during Henry VIII's reign.
