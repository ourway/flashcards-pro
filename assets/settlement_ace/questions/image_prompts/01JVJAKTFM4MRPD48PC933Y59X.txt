A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting depicting a mountainous Welsh landscape in a 16:9 format. The central focus is a formidable, stone-built Welsh castle perched atop the highest peak, bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun. The castle's flag proudly displays the Welsh Dragon (Y Ddraig Goch) in vibrant red. Around the base of the mountain, the landscape transitions into rolling green hills and valleys, dotted with traditional Welsh cottages with slate roofs. In the foreground, a small group of Welsh warriors, clad in historically accurate attire with round shields and spears, stand guard, facing outwards towards the open landscape. The horizon line is broken by distant, silhouetted figures of Anglo-Saxon soldiers, appearing small and far away, symbolizing their lack of control over the Welsh territory. A winding river flows through the valley, reflecting the colors of the sky. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of green, blue, and grey, with the striking red of the dragon flag providing a bold contrast. The art style should be realistic, focusing on accurate depictions of Welsh architecture, clothing, and natural scenery. The composition should emphasize the strength and independence of the Welsh people and their land, subtly conveying the idea that Wales was not under Anglo-Saxon rule.
