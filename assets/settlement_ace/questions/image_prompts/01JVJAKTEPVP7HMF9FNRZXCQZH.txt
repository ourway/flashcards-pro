A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a split composition: on the left, a vibrant depiction of the Welsh Assembly Building in Cardiff, bathed in soft, warm light, with the Welsh Dragon flag subtly waving in the background. Architectural details are precise, with pastel color palette. On the right, mirroring the Welsh scene, is the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh, similarly rendered with meticulous detail and illuminated gently, with the Saltire flag discreetly displayed. The color palettes of both sides subtly incorporate the red, white, and blue of the UK flag, but in muted, pastel tones. A delicate, almost ethereal, bridge of interwoven thistle (symbol of Scotland) and daffodil (symbol of Wales) connects the two buildings at the center of the image, symbolizing the unified yet distinct nature of the devolved bodies. The background features a soft, watercolor wash of rolling green hills, representative of the British countryside, fading into a gentle, cloudy sky. The overall art style evokes a sense of historical importance and cultural pride, rendered with the precision of a botanical illustration and the warmth of a landscape painting.
