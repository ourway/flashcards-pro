A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical painting, ratio 16:9. The scene depicts Mary, Queen of Scots, in her royal attire, kneeling in prayer inside a grand, stone cathedral. Light streams through stained-glass windows, illuminating her face with a soft, ethereal glow. She is adorned in a deep blue velvet gown, embroidered with golden thistles, a symbol of Scotland. A delicate rosary is clutched in her hands. The cathedral's architecture is distinctly Scottish Gothic, with pointed arches and ribbed vaults. The stained-glass windows depict scenes from the Bible, rendered in rich, vibrant colors, dominated by blues, reds, and golds, echoing the colors of the UK flag but in a muted, historical tone. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, creating a serene and reverent atmosphere. Focus on the intricate details of her dress, the texture of the stone, and the play of light and shadow. The composition should draw the viewer's eye to Mary's devout expression and the sacred space around her, visually reinforcing her Catholic faith. A subtle halo of light surrounds her head, not as a religious symbol, but to highlight her importance and devotion. The background details should be rich and immersive, creating a sense of historical accuracy and grandeur.
