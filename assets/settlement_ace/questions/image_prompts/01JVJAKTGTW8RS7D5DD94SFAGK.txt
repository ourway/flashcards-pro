A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting depicting Queen Elizabeth II seated regally on her ornate throne within Buckingham Palace. The composition is focused on the Queen, positioned centrally within the 16:9 frame. She wears the Imperial State Crown, shimmering with realistically rendered jewels, and a royal blue gown with the Garter Star prominently displayed. Behind her, the iconic red and gold throne is intricately detailed, showcasing its rich textures and carvings. In the foreground, suggest, through visual cues like musical notes rising subtly from a hidden orchestra pit, the commencement of the National Anthem. The colour palette leans heavily on the colours of the UK flag: royal blue for the Queen's gown and background elements, rich red for the throne upholstery and subtle accents, and white/cream for architectural details and Queen Elizabeth's hair. The overall ambiance should evoke a sense of solemnity, patriotism, and the historical weight of the monarchy, using soft, diffused lighting to highlight the Queen's dignified expression. The art style should be highly detailed and realistic, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements, giving the image a classic, timeless quality reminiscent of a formal royal portrait.
