A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting depicting the Great Fire of London in 1666. The scene focuses on the River Thames, with the city engulfed in flames in the background. The fire should have intense oranges, yellows, and reds, with thick black smoke billowing upwards, partially obscuring the sky. Use a pastel colour palette with a red and white colour scheme to resemble the UK flag. On the river, depict small boats filled with people attempting to escape the inferno, their faces etched with fear and desperation. Key buildings like St. Paul's Cathedral should be recognizable, though heavily damaged by the fire. The composition should emphasize the scale and devastation of the fire, with flames reaching high into the sky. The artistic style should be realistic, capturing the architectural details of the 17th-century buildings while conveying the chaos and intensity of the disaster. Include subtle visual cues, such as embers floating in the air, to enhance the sense of realism and movement. The overall mood should be dramatic but also educational, reminding viewers of a significant event in British history. The image should be 16:9 and landscape orientation, with the main subject and idea in the center.
