A watercolour painting in a realistic style, ratio 16:9, depicting a stylized cricket match between England and Australia, with the central focus on a cricket wicket that is visibly charred and smoking lightly. The wicket is positioned on a meticulously drawn cricket pitch, with faint outlines of players in the background, blurred to emphasize the smoldering wicket. The stumps are partially disintegrated into ash at their base, with wisps of grey smoke curling upwards. The colour palette should be dominated by pastel shades of red, white, and blue, reminiscent of the UK flag, but softened and muted. The sky overhead transitions from a light blue to a hazy, warm orange, suggesting a sunset or the aftermath of intense heat. The grass of the cricket pitch should be a vibrant green, contrasting with the charred wicket. Subtle details should include small embers glowing within the ash and a gentle breeze indicated by the slight curvature of the smoke. The overall composition should create a sense of drama and historical significance, evoking the intensity and legacy of the rivalry symbolized by "The Ashes."
