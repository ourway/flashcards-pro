A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting the geographical outlines of England, Wales, and Scotland, arranged to subtly suggest a single, unified landmass. The color palette should primarily consist of soft, pastel shades, interspersed with strategic touches of red, white, and blue, reminiscent of the UK flag. England is represented with gently rolling green hills dotted with quintessential thatched-roof cottages and grazing sheep. Wales is illustrated with majestic, rugged mountains, cascading waterfalls, and ancient stone castles perched on hillsides. Scotland features towering, misty mountains, serene lochs reflecting the sky, and iconic Highland cattle grazing peacefully. The three landmasses are positioned adjacent to each other, with subtle gradations in color and texture to indicate their individual identities while also conveying a sense of interconnectedness. A unifying element, such as a delicate, winding river system originating in Scotland and flowing through all three countries, can be introduced to further symbolize their shared geography. The overall composition should evoke a feeling of pastoral beauty, historical depth, and the harmonious coexistence of distinct yet related entities, firmly placing the image within the British Isles. The artwork should be detailed and realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and should not contain any text or numbers.
