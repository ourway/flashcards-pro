A hand-drawn 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style depicting a serene Easter sunrise over rolling green hills reminiscent of the English countryside. The sky is painted in pastel shades of pink, lavender, and pale blue, mirroring the colors of Easter eggs. A choir of angels, rendered in soft, ethereal watercolors, rises from behind the hills. Each angel holds a musical instrument - a harp, a flute, a violin - all subtly glowing with a gentle light. In the center of the image, positioned slightly above the horizon, is a radiant, golden musical score unfurling like a banner. The score is intentionally left unreadable, representing the universal language of music. Light beams emanate from the musical score, illuminating the landscape below and creating a sense of divine inspiration. The overall composition should evoke feelings of peace, joy, and spiritual awakening, aligning with the Easter season. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel hues, with subtle accents of gold and silver to highlight the musical elements and angelic figures. The style should lean towards classical watercolor techniques, with soft washes and delicate details to create a visually appealing and memorable image. The ratio is 16:9.
