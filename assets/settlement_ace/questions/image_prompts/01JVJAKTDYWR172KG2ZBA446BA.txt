A somber, hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style (16:9 ratio). The scene depicts a medieval English village, shrouded in a pervasive, ominous atmosphere. The color palette leans heavily on muted blues, grays, and blacks, with subtle hints of faded purples to evoke a sense of decay and despair. The focal point is a winding village street, nearly deserted, with cobblestones slick with a perpetual dampness. Several houses have dark markings on their doors, a stark symbol of the plague within. A lone figure, a medieval doctor in a long, dark robe and a beaked mask, stands in the center of the street, casting a long, melancholic shadow. His head is slightly bowed in defeat. In the background, the iconic silhouette of a medieval English church looms, its spire piercing the cloudy, grey sky. Ravens perch on the rooftops and the church steeple, their presence adding to the overall sense of foreboding. The air is thick with a visible haze, suggesting the spread of disease. The entire image should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and the devastating impact of the plague, with the overwhelming darkness subtly alluding to the "Black Death". No text is included.
