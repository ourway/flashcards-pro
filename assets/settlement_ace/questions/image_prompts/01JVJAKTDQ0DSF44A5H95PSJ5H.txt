A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, set against a soft, pastel-colored background reminiscent of a serene English countryside. The central focus is a long wooden table, subtly bathed in warm light emanating from a high window, suggesting a courtroom setting. Around the table, three figures are seated: an elderly woman with kind eyes, a middle-aged man with a neatly trimmed beard, and a younger woman with her hair pulled back. Each figure is dressed in ordinary, everyday attire – a cardigan, a tweed jacket, and a simple blouse, respectively – emphasizing their status as ordinary citizens. Before them, a single, bound legal document sits on the table, slightly blurred in the background, de-emphasizing its importance. The overall composition conveys a sense of calm deliberation and community involvement. Pastel colors, dominated by soft blues, gentle pinks, and muted yellows, evoke a sense of trustworthiness and approachability. The image should avoid any stern or intimidating elements, instead, aiming to communicate the idea of ordinary people contributing to the justice system. The scene is framed to fill the 16:9 ratio, with the table and figures centrally positioned, and the background details kept minimal to avoid distraction.
