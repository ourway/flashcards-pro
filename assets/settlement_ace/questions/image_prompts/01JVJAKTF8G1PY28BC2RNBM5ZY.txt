A watercolour illustration in a realistic style depicting a somber scene set within a stone tower reminiscent of a Scottish castle, rendered in a pastel colour palette with hints of blue and grey. The central figure is a woman with auburn hair, dressed in a dark blue, simple gown, her face etched with a melancholic expression, representing Mary, Queen of Scots. She stands near a tall, arched window, gazing out at a landscape blurred by rain. The window's bars cast long shadows across the stone floor. A partially visible hourglass sits on a small wooden table beside her, its sand nearly emptied, symbolizing the passage of time. Twenty small, wilting Scottish thistles are subtly arranged near the base of the window, representing the years of her imprisonment. The overall composition should convey a sense of confinement, reflection, and the long duration of her captivity. The light should be dim and diffused, emphasizing the somber mood. The background landscape outside the window should be a muted green and grey, suggesting the Scottish Highlands under a cloudy sky. The scene should evoke a historical feel, reminiscent of 16th-century Scotland, but avoid any overt symbols of royalty or conflict.
