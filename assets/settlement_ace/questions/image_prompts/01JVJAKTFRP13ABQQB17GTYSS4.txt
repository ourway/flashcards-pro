A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the historical moment of the first Union Flag's creation in 1606. The scene centers on a craftsman's workshop. Sunlight streams through a window, illuminating the craftsman as he meticulously stitches together the red cross of St. George (England) and the white saltire of St. Andrew (Scotland) onto a deep blue field, forming the original Union Flag. The craftsman is dressed in period clothing, and the workshop is filled with appropriate tools and materials - spools of thread, bolts of cloth, a wooden workbench, and sketches of the flag design. A partially completed flag hangs on the wall behind him, showing the separate crosses before they are joined. The color palette is primarily comprised of the colors of the Union Flag: deep blues, vibrant reds, and crisp whites. The overall composition is balanced and symmetrical, with the craftsman and the flag at the center, drawing the viewer's eye. The style of the painting should be reminiscent of classic historical illustrations, with a focus on detail and accuracy. The background is slightly blurred to keep the focus on the flag and the craftsman. Pastel color palette.
