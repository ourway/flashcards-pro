A hand-drawn, watercolor-style landscape depicting the rolling, green hills of Wales under a pastel blue sky. Dominating the center of the image is a majestic, ancient stone castle, its architecture distinctly Welsh, complete with round towers and battlements. The castle is positioned on a small hill, overlooking a valley with sheep peacefully grazing. In the foreground, a winding river reflects the sky and the castle, creating a mirror effect. Along the riverbank, vibrant daffodils, the national flower of Wales, bloom in abundance, their yellow petals contrasting beautifully with the green landscape. Subtle, stylized Celtic knot patterns are integrated into the stonework of the castle, adding a touch of cultural significance. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades of green, blue, and yellow, creating a serene and inviting atmosphere. The composition should be framed to emphasize the vastness of the Welsh landscape and the historical importance of the castle, with the daffodils serving as a reminder of the nation's unique identity. The style is realistic, detailed, and evocative, like a page from a beautifully illustrated history book, with soft shading and gentle blending of colors to create a sense of depth and atmosphere.
