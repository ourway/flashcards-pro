A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style (pastel colours) depicting a young adult, 18 years old, standing confidently in front of a stylized, simplified version of the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben. The young adult is dressed in smart casual clothing, reflecting a sense of civic responsibility. A light pastel blue background fades slightly darker towards the bottom. To the left of the young adult, a stylized, oversized ballot box with a single ballot paper being inserted is shown. The ballot paper has a simple tick on it. To the right, a symbolic representation of the scales of justice is shown, perfectly balanced. The scales are crafted from a light pastel gold. Subtle rays of light emanate from behind the young adult, highlighting their importance. The overall composition is symmetrical and balanced, with the young adult as the central focal point. The Houses of Parliament are simplified to focus on their iconic silhouette, avoiding intricate details. The colour palette should consist of pastel blues, reds, and whites reminiscent of the UK flag, with subtle accents of gold. The entire scene should evoke a sense of maturity, responsibility, and participation in the democratic process, linking voting and jury service to the age of 18. The perspective should be slightly low, making the young adult appear empowered and significant.
