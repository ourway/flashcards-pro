A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, focusing on a vibrant yet balanced composition. The central image depicts a majestic, simplified representation of the India Gate in New Delhi. The India Gate is framed by a symmetrical arrangement of trees, reflecting the ordered design principles championed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. The sky above transitions from a soft, pastel blue to a gentle, warm orange, reminiscent of a sunset, casting a golden glow on the scene. Subtle architectural details are included, such as the arched gateways and the inscriptions on the India Gate, but simplified for clarity. In the foreground, a suggestion of a formal garden with neatly manicured lawns and symmetrical flowerbeds adds depth and perspective. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, oranges, and greens, with subtle accents of red in the flowers, evoking a sense of tranquility and historical significance. The illustration should capture the essence of New Delhi as a planned city, emphasizing its grand scale and the harmonious integration of architecture and landscape. The image should be devoid of any text or numbers, relying solely on visual cues to evoke the association with New Delhi as the government center of India, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. The style should be reminiscent of vintage travel posters, with a focus on clean lines, balanced composition, and a subtle sense of grandeur.
