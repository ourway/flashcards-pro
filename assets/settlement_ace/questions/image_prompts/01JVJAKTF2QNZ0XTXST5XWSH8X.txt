A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a panoramic view of Edinburgh, Scotland. The composition should be centered to highlight the city's key landmarks. In the foreground, rolling green hills transition into the bustling cityscape. Dominating the skyline, Edinburgh Castle sits majestically atop a craggy volcanic rock, its stone walls rendered with careful attention to texture and historical accuracy. Below the castle, the Royal Mile winds its way through the Old Town, with detailed depictions of the historic buildings lining the street. To the left, Arthur's Seat rises as a prominent backdrop. The color palette should primarily consist of muted blues, greens, and grays, reminiscent of the Scottish landscape, with accents of warm, earthy tones in the buildings. The sky should be a soft, watercolour wash of blues and purples, conveying a sense of atmosphere and depth. Include subtle details such as chimney smoke rising from the buildings and flags gently waving atop the castle turrets. The overall impression should be one of historical grandeur and cultural richness, evoking the spirit of Edinburgh as the capital of Scotland.
