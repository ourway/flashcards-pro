A hand-drawn, realistic 2D portrait of Emmeline Pankhurst, rendered in a pastel colour palette with subtle hints of the UK flag's colours (red, white, and blue) incorporated tastefully. The portrait should be a close-up, focusing on her face and upper body, set against a soft, watercolour-style background. Emmeline Pankhurst should be depicted with a determined yet kind expression. She is wearing a historically accurate Edwardian-era dress in muted tones, accented with a purple, white, and green sash â€“ the colours of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). A delicate suffragette rosette is pinned to her lapel. The background should feature subtle, stylized depictions of historical events related to the women's suffrage movement, such as a peaceful march or a gathering of women holding banners. These background elements should be faint and dreamlike, not distracting from the main subject. The overall art style should evoke a sense of historical significance and feminine strength. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a gentle, respectful atmosphere. The image should convey a sense of quiet determination and the importance of her role in the fight for women's rights. The composition should be balanced and harmonious, with Emmeline Pankhurst positioned slightly off-center to create visual interest. The image ratio is 16:9, with the primary focus on the central area.
