A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image, watercolour style, ratio 16:9. The scene captures the interior of the Royal Albert Hall during "The Proms." The colour palette leans towards pastel shades with strategic uses of red, white, and blue accents subtly referencing the UK flag. The focus is on the orchestra, bathed in warm, golden light emanating from elegant chandeliers. Musicians are depicted with realistic detail, their instruments gleaming. Above the orchestra, a swirling, colourful representation of music notes and sound waves fills the air, creating a visual metaphor for the immersive experience of classical music. Attendees are visible in the tiered seating, appearing as blurred, impressionistic figures, suggesting a vast and appreciative audience. Hanging above the orchestra are banners with subtle classical motifs, like laurel wreaths and lyres. The overall composition evokes a sense of grandeur, history, and cultural significance, highlighting the Proms as a central pillar of classical music in the UK. The art style blends realism with impressionistic elements, achieving a balance between accuracy and artistic expression. The image should not contain any text or numbers and should be suitable for all ages.
