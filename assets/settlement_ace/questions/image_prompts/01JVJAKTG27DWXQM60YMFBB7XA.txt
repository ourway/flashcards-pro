A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical tapestry, depicting King Cnut the Great. The scene unfolds on a windswept, rocky coastline of England. Cnut, a figure of regal authority, stands centrally within the 16:9 frame, his gaze fixed on the incoming tide. He is adorned in traditional Viking attire, a detailed tunic with intricate knotwork patterns, and a helmet. He is seated on a throne, which is at the edge of the water. The sea is coloured in shades of pastel blues and greens, with white-capped waves crashing against the shore. Cnut is portrayed with an outstretched hand, seemingly commanding the waves to halt, but the tide is ignoring him and washing over his feet and the throne. The sky above is a blend of pastel blues and greys, hinting at an overcast day. In the distant background, a fleet of Viking longboats is visible, their sails billowing in the wind. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, mirroring the tones of the UK flag – soft blues, muted reds, and creams – to evoke a sense of historical serenity. The composition should emphasize Cnut's futile attempt to control the tide, symbolizing his reign and the limitations of even the most powerful monarchs, whilst visually connecting him to the sea and his Danish origins. The scene is framed by the natural elements, reinforcing the idea of England's coastal history and Cnut's place within it.
