A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a majestic rowing scene. The central focus is a single, determined rower, clearly representing Sir Steve Redgrave, powerfully stroking through calm water. The rower is clad in a Team GB rowing uniform, the colours subtly echoing the Union Jack: navy blue shorts, a white top with red detailing. His face is etched with focused determination, sweat glistening on his brow. The rowing boat is sleek and modern, cutting cleanly through the water. In the background, five Olympic gold medals are subtly suspended in the air, each represented by a golden laurel wreath subtly shimmering above the water, gradually decreasing in size with distance to represent the consecutive nature of the victories. The sky is a soft pastel blue, reflecting in the water, creating a tranquil yet powerful atmosphere. The banks of the river are lush green, dotted with subtle hints of quintessential British countryside elements like willow trees and grazing sheep in the far distance. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel blues, greens, and golds, creating a visually appealing and memorable image. The art style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish elements, emphasizing accurate human anatomy and realistic water reflections.
