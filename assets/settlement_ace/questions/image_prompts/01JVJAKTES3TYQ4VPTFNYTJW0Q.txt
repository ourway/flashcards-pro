A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting the Great Fire of London in 1666. The composition is focused centrally within the 16:9 ratio. The River Thames dominates the foreground, reflecting the intense orange and red hues of the raging fire consuming the city skyline behind it. Numerous small, detailed boats are visible on the river, filled with people attempting to escape the inferno. On the left side of the image, St. Paul's Cathedral is depicted engulfed in flames, its iconic dome partially collapsed. The buildings are tightly packed, illustrating the close proximity that contributed to the fire's rapid spread. Wisps of dark grey smoke billow upwards, partially obscuring a pastel blue sky, creating a stark contrast between the destructive fire and the serene backdrop. Use of a warm colour palette of oranges, reds, yellows, and browns to emphasize the heat and devastation of the fire. The style should evoke historical paintings, reminiscent of depictions of the event from the period, aiming for an educational yet artistically captivating image. Ensure the image is devoid of any text or numerical representations, focusing solely on the visual narrative of the fire.
