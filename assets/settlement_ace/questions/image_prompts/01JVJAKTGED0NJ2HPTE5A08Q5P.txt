A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is on King Henry VIII, depicted from the waist up, with a regal yet contemplative expression. He is adorned in traditional Tudor attire: a richly embroidered doublet in deep red and gold, and a heavy gold chain signifying his royal status. His face is framed by a neatly trimmed beard and a Tudor-style hat embellished with jewels. Behind Henry VIII, subtly emerging from a soft-focus background, is a depiction of a grand cathedral, rendered in muted stone colors. The cathedral's architecture should reflect the English Gothic style, with pointed arches and stained-glass windows only slightly visible. A quill pen rests delicately in Henry's hand, poised above a partially visible scroll, suggesting the act of writing or decreeing. The overall color palette leans towards the colors of the UK flag, incorporating shades of red, white, and blue, but in a softened, pastel rendition. The background subtly incorporates faint symbols of religious reformation, such as a stylized cross and dove, to subtly link Henry VIII with the establishment of the Anglican Church. The light should be soft and diffused, creating a sense of historical significance and solemnity.
