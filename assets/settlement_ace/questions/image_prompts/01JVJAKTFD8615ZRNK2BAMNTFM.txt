A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, capturing the essence of two iconic Shakespearean quotes. The composition is divided into two distinct yet harmonious scenes. On the left, a contemplative human skull rests atop a stack of ancient, leather-bound books, bathed in soft, melancholic light. A single, wilting rose lies beside the skull, symbolizing mortality and the ephemeral nature of existence. The background fades into a dark, inky blue, creating a sense of profound introspection. On the right, a vibrant and joyful scene unfolds: a lush, green meadow bursting with life. Darling buds of May, rendered in delicate pastel shades of pink, yellow, and white, are scattered across the landscape. Sunlight streams through the scene, illuminating the blossoming flowers and creating a sense of hope and renewal. A gentle breeze seems to rustle through the meadow. The sky above is a clear, cerulean blue. The overall color palette leans towards pastel hues, with occasional bursts of vibrant color to emphasize the contrasting themes of life and death. The entire image should evoke a sense of timelessness and the enduring power of Shakespeare's words.
