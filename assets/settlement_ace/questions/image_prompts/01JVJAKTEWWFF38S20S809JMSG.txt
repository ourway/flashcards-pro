A hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, rendered in watercolor with a predominantly pastel color palette. The central focus is a split portrait within a single oval frame. On the left side, Queen Mary I is depicted with a stern expression, dressed in dark, heavy royal robes. Flames subtly flicker around her, hinting at the burning of religious dissenters, without being graphic. Her side of the portrait is cast in muted, somber colors. On the right side, Queen Elizabeth I is depicted with a more serene and intelligent expression. She is adorned in lighter, more ornate Elizabethan attire, with subtle gold embroidery. Around her, symbols of prosperity and the arts, such as books and theatrical masks, are subtly woven into the background, representing the flourishing of culture during her reign. Light pastel blues and golds illuminate this side of the portrait. The oval frame is subtly decorated with Tudor roses, half in a deep red symbolizing Mary's reign, and the other half in a lighter pink, symbolizing Elizabeth's era. The background is a soft, blended wash of pastel blues and reds, creating a gentle contrast that emphasizes the differing religious climates under each queen's rule. The composition aims to visually distinguish between the two queens and associate them with their respective religious policies, forming a memorable visual mnemonic. The overall effect is an educational, historical, and artistic representation suitable for all ages, with no text present.
