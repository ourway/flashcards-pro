A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical painting. The scene depicts a grand, yet somber, room within a British manor house, bathed in soft, natural light filtering through tall, arched windows. The color palette leans heavily on pastel blues, muted reds, and creams, echoing the colors of the UK flag in a subtle, artistic way. In the center stands a young man, Richard Cromwell, dressed in fine, but understated, 17th-century attire. He is holding a shield emblazoned with a lion emblem, symbolizing protection and legacy. The shield is slightly tarnished, hinting at the challenges ahead. Behind him, a large portrait of Oliver Cromwell hangs on the wall, casting a long shadow that partially obscures Richard. To Richard's right, a quill and inkwell rest on a table beside an official-looking document with an ornate seal, representing the transfer of power. To Richard's left, a loyal hound sits patiently, looking up at him with trust. The overall composition is carefully balanced to convey a sense of duty, inheritance, and the weight of responsibility. The art style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and emotional depth, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements. The focus is on creating a memorable visual representation of Richard as a 'Protector' of his father's legacy, reinforcing the title 'Lord Protector'.
