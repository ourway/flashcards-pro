A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting two distinct but equally enchanting English gardens. The image is divided vertically, with Sissinghurst Castle Garden occupying the left half and Bodnant Garden the right. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, subtly incorporating red, white, and blue hues reminiscent of the UK flag.

On the left, Sissinghurst is portrayed as a series of interconnected garden 'rooms,' each bursting with diverse flora in harmonious color schemes. A weathered brick tower rises gently in the background, partially covered in climbing roses. Focus on the white garden, filled with white flowers and silvery foliage, creating a serene and ethereal atmosphere.

On the right, Bodnant Garden cascades down a gentle slope. The famous Laburnum Arch, a tunnel of golden yellow flowers, is prominently featured, drawing the eye into the heart of the garden. Below the arch, a vibrant mix of rhododendrons and azaleas adds splashes of pink, orange, and purple. In the distance, suggest the rolling hills of Wales, creating a sense of depth and grandeur.

The composition emphasizes the contrast between Sissinghurst's enclosed, intimate spaces and Bodnant's expansive, landscape-oriented design. The style should evoke a sense of tranquility, history, and the quintessential English love for horticulture. Delicate brushstrokes capture the texture of petals, leaves, and stone, creating a rich and inviting scene, emphasizing the beauty and diversity of notable UK gardens.
