A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a celestial scene dominated by the planet Jupiter. Jupiter, rendered in swirling shades of orange, brown, and cream, is centrally positioned within a vast, dark blue and purple cosmos speckled with faint, distant stars. Emanating from Jupiter are musical notes, flowing outwards like waves, gradually transforming into the recognizable shape of a church spire silhouetted against a pastel pink and orange dawn. To the bottom left, a laurel wreath, symbolizing musical achievement, lies broken and discarded. To the bottom right, a stylized portrait of Gustav Holst, recognizable by his distinctive mustache and thoughtful expression, is subtly embedded within a nebula, almost like a constellation. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of grandeur and spiritual connection, linking Holst's 'The Planets' with its adaptation into a British hymn, while the broken laurel wreath subtly hints at the incorrect attribution to Elgar. The color palette should be mainly pastel colors, and the overall style should be reminiscent of classic astronomical illustrations combined with artistic portraiture.
