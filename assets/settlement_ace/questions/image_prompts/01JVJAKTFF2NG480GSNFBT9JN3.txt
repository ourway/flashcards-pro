A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a split scene. The color palette primarily consists of pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly referencing the UK flag. The composition is centered, emphasizing the two key elements of the answer. On the left side, a hand gently places a stylized, ornate key into a lock shaped like the map of the United Kingdom. The key is crafted from interwoven strands of various nationalities' flags, subtly hinting at eligibility to work in the UK. On the right side, a detailed, slightly aged passport rests open, revealing a photorealistic portrait of a diverse individual. The passport is adorned with intricate, authentic-looking stamps and seals, signifying identity. A soft, diffused light illuminates the entire scene, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The background is a muted, creamy color, ensuring the focus remains on the key and passport. The overall impression should be one of official documentation and secure access, visually representing the requirements for a National Insurance number application. The style should evoke a sense of heritage and importance.
