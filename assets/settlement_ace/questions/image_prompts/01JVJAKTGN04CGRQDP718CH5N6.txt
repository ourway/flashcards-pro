A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style (16:9). The central focus is a healthy, vibrant Earth, depicted as a globe cradled gently in two cupped human hands. The hands are diverse in skin tone, symbolizing global unity. Lush green landscapes cover the continents, with thriving forests, clear blue rivers snaking through the land, and snow-capped mountains in the background. The sky above is a soft pastel blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. Radiating outwards from the Earth are stylized beams of light in shades of green, representing growth and positive energy. Around the base of the cradled Earth, intertwine delicate, climbing plants with vibrant, heart-shaped leaves in pastel colours. The overall color scheme should predominantly feature greens, blues, and earthy tones, with hints of pastel red and white in the sky and light beams, subtly referencing the UK flag. The Earth should appear fragile yet resilient, emphasizing the need for environmental care. The image should evoke a sense of hope, responsibility, and the beauty of nature. The style should be reminiscent of vintage nature illustrations, emphasizing the educational aspect.
