A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a grand, ornate clock tower reminiscent of Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben), but subtly stylized with a more whimsical, less austere design. Positioned to the left of the clock tower is a flock of doves taking flight, each dove individually rendered with delicate detail in shades of white and pale grey, symbolizing peace and independence. To the right of the clock tower, depict a sturdy, ancient oak tree, its branches reaching upwards, laden with leaves rendered in varying shades of green, suggesting resilience and deep roots. The tree's trunk should be wide and gnarled, hinting at age and wisdom. The sky above should be a soft, pastel blue, with a few wispy, white clouds. The overall color palette should evoke the colors of the UK flag â€“ incorporating reds, whites, and blues in a muted, pastel tone. The ground is a gentle, rolling hill covered in heather, painted in subtle purples and greens. The entire scene should convey a sense of calm, contemplation, and the independent spirit. The art style aims for realism, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and creating a visually appealing, educational mnemonic.
