A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is on a determined-looking woman, dressed in early 20th-century clothing reminiscent of the suffragette era. She's holding a banner high above her head. The banner is a pastel purple colour and is blank (no text). The woman has a serious, yet hopeful expression, her eyes fixed on the horizon. The background should depict a soft, rolling green landscape, subtly suggesting the British countryside. Over her left shoulder are a few other women in the same attire, also holding blank pastel coloured banners. The overall colour palette should lean towards soft pastels, with hints of the UK flag colours (red, white, and blue) subtly integrated â€“ perhaps a faint red ribbon in her hair, or a muted blue sky. The art style should evoke a sense of historical realism, but with a gentle, watercolour aesthetic. The composition should be balanced, drawing the viewer's eye to the woman's determined face and the raised banner, symbolising the suffragettes' campaign for women's votes. The style is reminiscent of a classical painting, emphasizing light and shadow to create depth and emotion.
