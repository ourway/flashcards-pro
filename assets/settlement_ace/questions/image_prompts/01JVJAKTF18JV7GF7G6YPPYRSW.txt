A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style depicting a diverse group of people standing together, shoulder to shoulder, in front of a stylised town hall building reminiscent of classic British architecture. The group comprises individuals representing various ethnicities and age groups. One person is clearly of Irish descent, with classic Irish features and clothing subtly referencing Irish heritage, such as a Claddagh ring visible on their hand. Another is an individual from a Commonwealth nation, perhaps wearing a discreet piece of traditional fabric from their country of origin subtly incorporated into their modern attire. A third person is clearly of European origin, with features and clothing alluding to their European heritage. Everyone is smiling and looking forward. The British citizen is placed slightly forward, symbolically representing the host nation, and wears a subtle Union Jack pin. The town hall in the backdrop features a clock tower with the time permanently set to 10:00 am, symbolizing the start of a new day and new beginnings. The overall colour palette should be pastel, with hints of blues, reds, and whites subtly resembling the UK flag without being overly patriotic. The composition should be balanced, with the town hall providing a solid background and the diverse group of people forming a strong, unified foreground, indicating the collaborative nature of local government. The sky above is a soft, watercolour wash of pale blue, suggesting optimism and progress.
