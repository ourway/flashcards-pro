A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a symbolic wedding ceremony set against the backdrop of a stylized British landscape. The art style should be reminiscent of classic botanical illustrations, with a focus on intricate details and soft pastel colors, primarily using shades of blue, red and white to evoke the UK flag. In the center of the image, two majestic oak trees, one representing England (symbolized by a Tudor rose subtly entwined in its branches) and the other representing Scotland (symbolized by a thistle subtly intertwined in its branches), are depicted with their roots intertwined underground. Above the intertwined roots lies an ornate wedding ring, half adorned with the Tudor rose and half with the Scottish thistle. The branches of the two trees reach up and intertwine, forming an archway resembling a chapel roof. Sunlight filters through the leaves, creating dappled patterns on the ground. At the base of the trees, a flowing river represents the border between the two countries now united. In the background, rolling hills dotted with sheep and quaint villages fade into the misty distance, symbolizing the unified landscape of Great Britain. The entire scene should convey a sense of harmony, unity, and historical significance, subtly hinting at the Act of Union without explicitly depicting any text. The overall composition should be balanced and aesthetically pleasing, evoking a sense of peace and prosperity. The image ratio is 16:9.
