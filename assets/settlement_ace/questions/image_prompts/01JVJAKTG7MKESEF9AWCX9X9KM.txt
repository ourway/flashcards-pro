A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical illustration, depicting Richard Arkwright in his original profession as a barber. The scene is set inside a traditional 18th-century British barbershop, with whitewashed walls and a single window providing soft, natural light. Arkwright, a young man with neatly combed hair, is shown carefully shaving a seated customer. The customer is a distinguished gentleman with a powdered wig, draped in a white cloth. Arkwright holds a gleaming straight razor in his right hand, his expression focused and professional. A small wooden table beside him holds shaving tools: a shaving brush, a bowl of soapy lather, and a sharpening strop. In the background, slightly blurred, are other details of the barbershop: a shelf with various bottles and jars, a hanging sign with a barber's pole, and a waiting area with wooden chairs. The color palette leans towards pastel hues, with soft blues, creams, and light browns dominating the scene. The barber's pole outside the window features the traditional red and white stripes, echoing the colors of the Union Jack. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, with Arkwright and the customer positioned centrally in the 16:9 frame, ensuring the focus remains on their interaction and the tools of his trade. The style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and the quiet, everyday life of 18th-century England.
