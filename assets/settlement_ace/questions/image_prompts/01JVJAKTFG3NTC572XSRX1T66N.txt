A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolour image in a realistic style, reminiscent of vintage legal illustrations. The scene is set against a backdrop of a faded, pastel blue sky, subtly echoing the colours of the UK flag. In the centre, a pair of antique scales of justice are prominently displayed. One side of the scale dramatically outweighs the other, signifying imbalance. On the lighter side, a feather, symbolising civil offense, gently floats upwards. On the heavier, grounded side, a meticulously detailed, ornate dagger rests heavily, its handle wrapped in a dark leather. The dagger is not overly menacing, but clearly suggests danger and intent. The base of the scales rests on a cobblestone street, alluding to the historical context of law and order in the UK. Subtle shadows and highlights accentuate the weight and sharpness of the dagger, contrasting with the ethereal lightness of the feather. The overall composition aims to convey the severe consequences of carrying a weapon, emphasizing that it is a serious criminal offense and not a minor civil matter. The colour palette is muted, predominantly pastel blues, reds, and creams, creating a serious yet approachable atmosphere.
