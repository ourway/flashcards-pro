A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting Edinburgh Castle perched majestically atop its volcanic rock, a visual representation of its enduring history. The castle should dominate the central space of the 16:9 landscape, its stone walls rendered with varied shades of grey and brown, highlighting the architectural details from different historical periods. The Scottish flag, the Saltire (a white cross on a blue background), gently flutters atop the highest tower, subtly echoing the Scottish identity. Around the base of the castle rock, suggest a vibrant, stylized representation of blooming heather, using pastel purples and greens to soften the overall image and add a touch of natural beauty. Emanating from the castle, create a soft, golden light that subtly illuminates the surrounding landscape, symbolizing the preservation and storytelling managed by "Historic Scotland." This light should not be harsh, but rather a gentle glow that suggests care and attention. In the foreground, barely visible, add a suggestion of a craftsman meticulously working on a stone, subtly implying the ongoing preservation efforts. The sky should be a soft, watercolour blend of blues and greys, typical of the Scottish climate, adding to the overall atmosphere of historical significance and careful preservation. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel variations of the UK flag colours – soft blues, reds, and whites – creating a visually appealing and memorable image that evokes the concept of historical preservation.
