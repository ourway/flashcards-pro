A watercolor painting in a realistic style, 16:9 ratio, depicting a warmly lit Welsh kitchen scene. The focal point is a rustic wooden table laden with freshly baked Welsh cakes. The cakes are golden brown, lightly dusted with powdered sugar, and arranged invitingly on a vintage floral patterned china plate. Beside the plate, a steaming cup of tea sits in a delicate china teacup, emitting wisps of vapor. In the background, a traditional Aga-style stove glows softly, casting a gentle warmth. A window behind the table offers a glimpse of the rolling green hills of the Welsh countryside, dotted with grazing sheep. A Welsh dragon motif is subtly incorporated into the design of the kitchen tiles behind the stove, using pastel blue and white shades. The color palette leans heavily on warm, inviting tones of gold, brown, and cream, with touches of pastel blue and green to evoke the Welsh landscape. The overall mood is cozy, inviting, and reminiscent of traditional Welsh hospitality. The composition should emphasize the visual appeal of the Welsh cakes and their connection to the Welsh landscape.
