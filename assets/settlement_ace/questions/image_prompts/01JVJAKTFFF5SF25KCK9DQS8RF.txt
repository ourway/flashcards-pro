A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a quaint, idealized English countryside scene. Rolling green hills stretch across the 16:9 landscape, dotted with charming cottages and grazing sheep. In the foreground, a weathered wooden signpost stands prominently, partially obscured by climbing roses and ivy. The signpost points in two directions; one arm leading toward a picturesque "County Court" building in the distance, complete with a slate roof and neatly trimmed hedges. The other arm is broken and tilting downwards. Near the broken arm of the signpost, a single, wilting red rose lies discarded on the ground. A pale bluebird perched atop the "County Court" sign, is singing into the wind. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel hues, with soft blues, greens, and pinks dominating the scene. The sky is a gentle gradient of light blue and white, suggesting a serene, yet subtly melancholic atmosphere. The artistic style is reminiscent of classic English landscape paintings, emphasizing detail and realism to create a memorable and symbolic image related to the correct answer.
