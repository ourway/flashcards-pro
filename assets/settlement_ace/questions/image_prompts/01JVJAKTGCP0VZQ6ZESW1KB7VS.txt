A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting two figures standing side-by-side in front of a silhouette of the Houses of Parliament. The figures are rendered as nearly identical twins, symbolizing the inseparable nature of the required documents. One twin holds an open passport, its pages subtly suggesting various visa stamps and immigration symbols, representing "documents proving your identity". The other twin holds a simplified, symbolic representation of a work permit, perhaps a stylized cogwheel intertwined with a laurel wreath, connoting industry and permission. The colour palette leans heavily on pastel shades of blue, white, and red, subtly echoing the colours of the Union Jack. The background is a soft, hazy watercolour wash, suggesting a bright, overcast London sky. The composition emphasizes symmetry and balance, reinforcing the idea that both documents are equally essential. Gentle light streams from the left, illuminating the twins and casting soft shadows that subtly define their forms. The overall tone is gentle, reassuring, and informative, designed to create a memorable visual association for the test-taker. The art style evokes classic British illustration, reminiscent of vintage travel posters or educational diagrams. The image should be in 16:9 format.
