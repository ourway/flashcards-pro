A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a split scene to highlight the historical discrepancy. The left side of the image showcases a vibrant, detailed depiction of the Battle of Hastings in 1066. William the Conqueror, clad in Norman armor, is depicted on horseback, leading his troops up a hill towards English soldiers wielding axes and shields. A prominent banner with Norman imagery flutters in the wind. The color palette on this side leans towards earthy tones and the red and yellow of the Norman flag. The right side of the image shows William of Orange on a horse, leading troops in the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland, 1690. Irish soldiers are shown on the opposite side of the river. The color palette on this side leans towards greens and blues to represent Ireland. A symbolic broken chain lies on the ground between the two scenes, representing the historical gap and the incorrect association of William of Orange with William the Conqueror's title. Above the broken chain, a ghostly image of a royal crown is shown, implying that William of Orange did not take the title "William the Conqueror". The composition is carefully balanced to emphasize the contrast and separation between the two historical figures and events. The overall style should evoke a sense of historical accuracy and educational clarity, employing a pastel color palette with hints of red, white, and blue to subtly allude to the UK flag.
