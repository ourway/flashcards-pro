A hand-drawn, realistic, watercolor-style illustration (16:9 landscape) depicting a bountiful breakfast plate, centered on a rustic wooden table. The plate is overflowing with an Ulster Fry: crispy bacon strips arranged artfully, two sunny-side-up eggs with vibrant orange yolks, plump sausages with a browned exterior, slices of black pudding showing their dark, rich color, and white pudding with a lighter hue. Button mushrooms and grilled tomato halves are nestled amongst the meats. Crucially, feature two distinct types of bread: slices of soda bread, identifiable by their characteristic cross cut, and potato bread, showcasing its slightly different texture and shape. The colors should lean towards a pastel palette, with creams, browns, and light reds dominating, accented by the bright yellow of the egg yolks and the deep reds of the tomatoes. The background should be softly blurred, suggesting a cozy kitchen setting, perhaps with a hint of a traditional Northern Irish cottage visible through a window. The overall impression should be one of warmth, abundance, and a hearty, traditional breakfast, unmistakably representing Ulster Fry. Avoid any cartoonish elements; strive for a realistic, detailed rendering that makes the food look appetizing and easily recognizable.
