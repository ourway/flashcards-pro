A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style (not cartoonish or abstract) depicting a vibrant purple Scottish Thistle against a soft, rolling, heather-covered hillside under a pastel blue sky with gentle clouds. The thistle should be the central focus, its thorny stem and leaves rendered with precision, showcasing its resilience and unique beauty. The purple flower head should be in full bloom, radiating a sense of proud defiance and natural elegance. The background should feature a subtle suggestion of distant, mist-shrouded mountains, evoking the Scottish Highlands. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel purples, blues, greens, and browns, creating a tranquil and serene atmosphere. The composition should ensure the thistle is prominently displayed in the center of the 16:9 landscape, with the hillside and sky acting as a supportive backdrop. The light should be soft and diffused, highlighting the delicate textures of the thistle and the surrounding landscape. The overall impression should be one of quiet strength, natural beauty, and a subtle reminder of Scotland's enduring spirit. No text should be included in the image. The artwork should feel educational and accurate.
