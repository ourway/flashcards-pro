A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting a classic British pub scene, bathed in soft, warm light. The image focuses on a centrally located, well-worn pool table with cues resting on its side. Two figures, rendered in a realistic style, are engaged in a friendly game of pool; one is lining up a shot, while the other leans casually against the table, a pint of beer resting nearby. The pub's interior is subtly visible, featuring wooden paneling, a dartboard in the background, and frosted glass windows. Subtle details, such as a chalk cube near the pool table and a patterned carpet beneath, add to the scene's authenticity. The color palette consists of pastel blues, reds, and whites, echoing the colors of the UK flag, while also creating a comfortable and inviting atmosphere. The lighting should highlight the green felt of the pool table and the polished wooden cues, drawing the viewer's eye to the game itself. The composition is balanced, with the pool table as the clear focal point, ensuring it dominates the central area of the 16:9 frame. The overall style should evoke a sense of nostalgia and the traditional British pub experience.
