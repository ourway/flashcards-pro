A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style landscape in a pastel color palette (primarily blues, light reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag) depicting a scene divided into two distinct geographical areas. On the left side, rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep lead towards a vibrant city skyline representing Aberdeen, Scotland. Key landmarks of Aberdeen, such as Marischal College, rendered in a realistic architectural style, are subtly visible against a backdrop of the North Sea. A gentle mist hangs in the air, characteristic of the Scottish Highlands. To the right, separated by a winding river (the River Tay), a similar landscape unfolds, showcasing Dundee, Scotland. The Dundee Law hill dominates the skyline, with the V&A Dundee museum depicted prominently at the river's edge. Both cityscapes are bustling with implied activity â€“ hints of ships in the harbor and people going about their day. In the far distance, a faint, stylized outline of the island of Ireland is visible, rendered in a muted green, almost blending into the horizon, subtly conveying its separation from the foreground Scottish cities. The overall composition emphasizes the geographical distance and cultural distinction between Scotland, represented by Aberdeen and Dundee, and the implied presence of Northern Ireland. The art style is realistic, avoiding cartoonish elements, and focuses on capturing the natural beauty and architectural details of the Scottish cities.
