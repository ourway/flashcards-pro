A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style depicting a lively town square scene split visually into two distinct sections representing Scotland and Wales. The left side portrays a bustling Scottish village square, complete with stone buildings, a bagpiper in traditional dress playing near a central fountain, and people engaged in community activities like a farmers market and children playing. The Scottish landscape extends into the background, showing rolling green hills and a loch. The right side mirrors this with a Welsh town square, featuring similar stone architecture but with a more rugged, mountainous backdrop characteristic of Wales. A choir sings in the Welsh square, and a game of rugby is taking place on a nearby field. Connecting both squares is a symbolic bridge adorned with intertwined thistle and daffodil emblems. People are freely walking across the bridge, engaging with both communities. Crucially, at the entrance to each town square, instead of individual registration desks, there's a single, shared welcome table overflowing with pamphlets about local events and community initiatives. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades with hints of blue, red, and white subtly incorporated to echo the UK flag, fostering a sense of shared heritage and common access rather than individual barriers. The overall composition emphasizes unity and shared community resources over individual processes.
