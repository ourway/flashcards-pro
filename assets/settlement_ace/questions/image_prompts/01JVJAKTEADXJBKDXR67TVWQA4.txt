A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting a scene in 15th-century Wales. The color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly referencing the UK flag without being overt. The focal point is a medieval Welsh scribe seated at a wooden table in a stone-walled study, illuminated by candlelight. He is diligently writing with a quill on parchment. Around him are stacks of bound legal documents, sealed with wax and ribbons. The documents feature intricate Celtic knotwork designs subtly incorporated into the borders. In the background, through an arched window, a vista of the Welsh countryside unfolds: rolling green hills dotted with stone villages, and a distant, snow-capped mountain range. A small, stylized Welsh dragon emblem is discreetly placed on the scribe’s signet ring. The light should cast long, soft shadows, lending an air of solemnity and historical significance to the scene. The overall composition should evoke a sense of order, permanence, and the establishment of laws and language within the Welsh landscape. The image should be detailed enough to capture the texture of the parchment, the wood grain of the table, and the intricate details of the scribe’s clothing, while maintaining a clear and focused composition.
