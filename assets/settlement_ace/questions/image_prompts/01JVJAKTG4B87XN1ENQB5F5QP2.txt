A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central composition depicts a grand, open book resting on a velvet cushion, its pages illuminated by soft, ethereal light. The book's spine is subtly embossed with a stylized royal crest. Emanating from the open pages is a radiant, swirling vortex of light in pastel blues, reds, and whites - colours reminiscent of the Union Jack. Within the vortex, symbolic representations of liberty and justice are intertwined: scales of justice, a quill pen writing on parchment, and a laurel wreath. The overall scene evokes a sense of enlightenment and transformation. The background is a muted, pastel blue, subtly hinting at a regal chamber with arched windows, but without any distracting details. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a peaceful and inspiring atmosphere. The art style should be reminiscent of classical book illustrations, with fine details and delicate brushstrokes. The image should convey the idea of a significant turning point, a 'revolution' of enlightenment leading to a 'glorious' new era, without any textual elements.
