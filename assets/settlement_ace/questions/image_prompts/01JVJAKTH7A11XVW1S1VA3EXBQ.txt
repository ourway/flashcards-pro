A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style (not cartoonish). The artwork visualizes the Union Flag of the United Kingdom, deconstructed into its constituent crosses. The primary focus is a central arrangement showcasing three distinct crosses, each representing a patron saint of the UK. To the left, St. George's Cross is depicted as a bold, upright red cross on a clean white background, symbolizing England. To the right, St. Andrew's Cross appears as a white saltire (diagonal cross) set against a vibrant azure blue field, emblematic of Scotland. Below, St. Patrick's Cross is represented by a red saltire on a white field, signifying Northern Ireland. The three crosses are slightly overlapping each other, implying their unification into a single entity. The background features a soft, blended wash of pastel blues and reds, subtly echoing the Union Flag's colour scheme. The overall composition is balanced and symmetrical, with the three crosses arranged to draw the eye to the center of the image. The watercolor technique should allow for soft gradients and subtle textures, giving the illustration a delicate and refined appearance. The color palette is predominantly pastel, with the reds, whites, and blues muted to create a calming and educational visual. The image should evoke a sense of British history and unity through its symbolic representation of the Union Flag's components.
