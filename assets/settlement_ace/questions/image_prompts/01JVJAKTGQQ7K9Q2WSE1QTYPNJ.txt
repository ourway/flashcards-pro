A watercolor illustration in a realistic style, ratio 16:9. The artwork depicts a central, symbolic representation of a fractured heart, rendered in pastel shades of pink and purple, resting on a stylized representation of the scales of justice. The heart is subtly cracked and pieced back together, with delicate, visible lines suggesting healing. The scales of justice are balanced, crafted from a combination of silver and gold hues, symbolizing fairness and impartiality. One side of the scale features a small, stylized figure representing an individual, while the other side features a figure representing their partner. Both figures are gender-neutral and are illustrated in simple, elegant lines. The background fades from a light blue at the top to a soft white at the bottom, creating a sense of calm and hope. The overall color palette leans towards pastel tones, with subtle accents of red, white, and blue – echoing the colors of the UK flag – woven into the details of the scales and figures. The scene is set indoors, with soft, diffused natural light coming from an unseen window, emphasizing the private nature of domestic violence. The artwork should convey a message of protection and justice, highlighting the equal application of the law regardless of relationship status.
