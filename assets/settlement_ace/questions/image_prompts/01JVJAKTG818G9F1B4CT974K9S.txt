A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a grand, classical-style building reminiscent of the UK's Royal Courts of Justice, rendered in pastel shades of blue and grey, with hints of red brick peeking through. The building's facade features several arched windows, each subtly framing a silhouette of a robed judge. These judges are diverse in age and gender, symbolizing the collective nature of the judiciary. In front of the building stands a meticulously detailed, ornate scale of justice, perfectly balanced, with light pastel blue and red ribbons intertwined around its stand. Soft, diffused light emanates from behind the building, creating a halo effect and emphasizing the importance of the judiciary. The surrounding environment is a serene, manicured lawn in pastel green, dotted with ancient oak trees, their leaves depicted in delicate shades of green and brown. The overall composition conveys a sense of solemnity, integrity, and the collective authority of the judicial system, using the building and the judges within as a visual representation of 'the judiciary' as a whole. The artwork should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and aiming for an educational and memorable visual mnemonic.
