A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting Margaret Thatcher standing confidently in front of the Houses of Parliament. The scene is set during a bright, crisp autumn day, with golden sunlight illuminating the iconic clock tower of Big Ben in the background. Thatcher is dressed in a sharp, navy-blue suit, a pearl necklace adorning her neck, her hairstyle perfectly coiffed. She holds a rolled-up document in her right hand, subtly symbolizing policy and leadership. The colour palette leans heavily on pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly echoing the colours of the Union Jack. Around Thatcher, stylized oak trees with rich green and golden leaves represent traditional British values and strength. Scattered at her feet are fallen autumn leaves, symbolizing the passage of time and the enduring impact of her policies. The overall composition is balanced and symmetrical, drawing the viewer's eye to Thatcher as the central figure, framed by the historical architecture and symbolic foliage. The Houses of Parliament are rendered with precise architectural detail, emphasizing their importance as a symbol of British democracy and governance. The background maintains a soft focus to ensure Thatcher remains the dominant element.
