A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolour illustration depicting a lively summer evening scene in Hyde Park, London. The artwork should be in a realistic style, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements. The colour palette should be primarily pastel, incorporating subtle hues of red, white, and blue to subtly allude to the UK flag.

The central focus is the iconic bandstand, brightly lit and overflowing with musicians passionately playing various instruments â€“ violins, cellos, trumpets, and flutes. The audience, composed of diverse individuals and families, sits and stands on picnic blankets scattered across the lush green lawn. They are dressed in light summer clothing, laughing, clapping, and enjoying the music. Balloons in pastel colours float gently above the crowd.

Behind the bandstand, silhouetted against the warm glow of the setting sun, are the recognizable London skyline landmarks: the London Eye, Big Ben, and the Shard. The overall atmosphere should be one of joyful celebration and cultural enrichment, emphatically conveying the idea of a summer music festival. The sky is a blend of light orange, pink, and blue, suggesting a long summer evening. The image should evoke the feeling of warmth, community, and the celebration of music, clearly associating the scene with a festive summer event rather than a religious observance. The scene should be detailed and realistic, capturing the essence of a lively Proms concert.
