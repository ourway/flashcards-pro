A meticulously detailed, realistic, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format depicting Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745. The central figure is a young, handsome man, Bonnie Prince Charlie, dressed in traditional Scottish Highland attire: a kilt in a muted tartan pattern, a sporran, a Jacobite white shirt, and a blue jacket. He stands on a slightly elevated, rocky outcrop in the Scottish Highlands. Around him, clansmen in various poses express their loyalty. Some are kneeling, offering their swords; others are raising their claymores in a salute. The background features a vast, misty Scottish Highland landscape with rolling hills, lochs reflecting the sky, and distant snow-capped mountains. Dominant colors are blues, greens, and browns of the landscape, complemented by the red accents in the tartans and the white of the Jacobite shirts. The overall style is realistic, aiming for historical accuracy, with soft, diffused lighting that creates a sense of romanticism and the misty atmosphere of the Highlands. The painting should evoke a sense of historical significance and the beginning of a campaign, with the focus on Bonnie Prince Charlie as a charismatic leader.
