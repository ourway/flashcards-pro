A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a central scene of balanced scales of justice. The scales are subtly stylized with embossed Celtic patterns on the arms, reflecting British heritage. On one tray, a stylized feather, light and airy, symbolizes "not guilty," while on the other, a weighty, antique-looking iron key represents "guilty." The key is slightly tarnished, hinting at the gravity of the decision. The backdrop features a soft-focus impression of the Houses of Parliament, rendered in pastel blues and grays, signifying the UK's legal framework. Light should stream from above, illuminating the scales and casting gentle shadows that emphasize the balance. The color palette should lean towards muted blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the Union Jack, but softened to create a calming, educational atmosphere. The overall composition aims for symmetry and clarity, ensuring the scales of justice are the focal point, with the feather and key clearly distinguishable, serving as visual cues for the jury's binary decision. The style should be realistic but with a touch of artistic flair to capture the solemnity and importance of the jury's role.
