A vibrant, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic, watercolor style. The scene is set in a gently rolling, verdant Northern Irish landscape under a pastel blue sky. In the foreground, a diverse group of people representing social services – a nurse assisting an elderly woman, a teacher helping a child read, a social worker talking to a family – are depicted interacting harmoniously. Behind them, a fertile agricultural scene unfolds: fields of golden wheat swaying in the breeze, healthy livestock grazing peacefully, and farmers tending to their crops with care. A quaint, whitewashed farmhouse with a red-tiled roof stands in the distance, emitting a sense of warmth and community. Subtle pastel shades of red, white, and blue are woven throughout the landscape, mirroring the colors of the UK flag. The overall composition emphasizes the interconnectedness of agriculture and social services, highlighting how both contribute to the well-being of Northern Ireland. The art style should evoke a sense of peace, prosperity, and diligent care, emphasizing the nurturing role of the Northern Ireland Assembly in these key areas. The image should be framed in a 16:9 ratio with the main subjects centered.
