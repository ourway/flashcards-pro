A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a pastel colour palette, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a brightly lit, humble stable scene. Inside, a newborn baby Jesus lies swaddled in a manger filled with soft straw, emanating a gentle, warm light. Mary and Joseph are kneeling beside the manger, looking down at the baby with expressions of love and adoration. A single, bright star shines directly above the stable, casting a beam of light onto the scene. Three wise men are depicted approaching the stable from the right side of the frame, carrying gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Shepherds are approaching the stable from the left side of the frame, their faces filled with awe and wonder. In the background, a peaceful, rolling landscape with sheep grazing in the fields. The overall mood is serene, joyful, and reverent, capturing the essence of the Nativity scene. The colour palette should consist of soft pastel blues, pinks, yellows, and whites, creating a gentle and comforting atmosphere. The art style should be reminiscent of classic Nativity paintings, with attention to detail in the figures' clothing, facial expressions, and the surrounding environment. The image should evoke a sense of peace, love, and new beginnings, symbolizing the birth of Jesus Christ.
