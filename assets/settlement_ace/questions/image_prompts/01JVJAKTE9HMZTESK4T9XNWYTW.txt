A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The scene depicts a lush, green, and slightly hilly Irish landscape at the dawn of the Middle Ages. Dominating the center is a Celtic high cross, intricately carved with traditional knotwork patterns. The cross is bathed in the soft, golden light of the rising sun, symbolizing the beginning of the era and Ireland's independent spirit. To the left of the cross, a small, round tower stands proudly, representing early Irish monastic settlements and centers of learning. Sheep graze peacefully in the foreground, indicating the agricultural nature of the society. In the background, rolling hills fade into a soft, misty blue, creating a sense of depth and tranquility. Colors are primarily pastel greens, blues, and golds, with subtle hints of red in the knotwork of the cross. The sky is a pale blue with delicate, watercolor clouds touched with pink and gold from the sunrise. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peace, self-sufficiency, and the distinct cultural identity of Ireland at the start of the Middle Ages, free from external influence. The artistic style should lean towards historical realism, capturing the essence of the time period while maintaining an educational and appealing aesthetic.
