A watercolor-style 2D illustration depicting a vibrant breakfast scene with an Ulster Fry as the central focus. The scene is set on a rustic wooden table, slightly worn, suggesting a cozy, traditional Northern Irish kitchen. The Ulster Fry is meticulously detailed: two pieces of soda bread, slightly browned and toasted, take up the center, accompanied by crispy bacon rashers, plump sausages with visible herbs, a perfectly fried egg with a runny yolk, grilled tomato halves, and a generous serving of white pudding and black pudding, all artfully arranged. The colors should be vibrant and appetizing, with the reds and browns of the meats contrasting against the paler tones of the bread and egg. The backdrop features a glimpse of a traditional Irish dresser, painted in a muted pastel blue, adorned with simple white porcelain plates and cups. Soft, natural light streams in from a window, casting gentle shadows across the table. In the distant background, a subtle, hazy representation of the Giant's Causeway can be seen through the window, hinting at the Northern Irish location. The overall style should evoke a sense of warmth, heritage, and the comforting appeal of a traditional Northern Irish breakfast. Focus on realistic rendering of the food textures and the details of the kitchen setting, avoiding cartoonish or overly stylized elements.
