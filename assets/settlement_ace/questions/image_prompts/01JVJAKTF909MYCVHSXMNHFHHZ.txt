A serene, hand-drawn watercolor painting depicting a Scottish landscape under a soft, pastel-colored sky. The central focus is a figure representing St. Andrew, rendered in a realistic style. He is depicted as an elderly man with kind eyes and a gentle smile, wearing simple, flowing robes in shades of muted blue and white, reminiscent of the Scottish flag. He stands on a gentle, grassy hillside overlooking a calm, blue loch. Behind him rises a majestic, snow-capped mountain range, characteristic of the Scottish Highlands. In his hands, he holds a saltire, the St. Andrew's Cross, depicted as a white "X" shape. The cross is subtly glowing with a soft, ethereal light. Around his feet, wildflowers in pastel shades of purple, yellow, and white dot the landscape. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peace, tranquility, and reverence. The style should be reminiscent of classic landscape paintings, emphasizing the natural beauty of Scotland and the saint's connection to the land. The colors should be primarily blues, whites, and greens, with touches of pastel yellow and purple, creating a visually harmonious and memorable image. The goal is to create a strong association between the image of Scotland, St. Andrew, and his symbolic cross.
