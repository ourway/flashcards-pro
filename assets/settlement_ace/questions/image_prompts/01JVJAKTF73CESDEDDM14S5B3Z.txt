A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is Emmeline Pankhurst, depicted from the waist up, standing on a makeshift wooden platform in a bustling town square reminiscent of early 20th-century Britain. Her attire consists of a dark, elegant Edwardian-era dress with suffragette ribbon colours of purple, white and green, symbolizing dignity, purity, and hope. She wears a determined expression, her eyes conveying passion and resolve. Her right arm is raised, hand formed into a fist, as if mid-speech, projecting her voice to the crowd. Around her, a diverse crowd of women, also dressed in period clothing, are listening intently, some holding banners with the WSPU colours and subtle, symbolic imagery (broken chains, rising suns). The background features brick buildings with vintage shop signs, a horse-drawn carriage passing by, and cobblestone streets. The overall colour palette should be a mix of pastel hues and the suffragette colours, with a slight emphasis on sepia tones to evoke a historical feel. The sky is overcast, but a ray of light breaks through, illuminating Emmeline Pankhurst, symbolizing her pivotal role in the women's suffrage movement. The composition should convey a sense of historical significance and the power of collective action, focusing on the visual representation of Emmeline Pankhurst's leadership and the birth of the WSPU.
