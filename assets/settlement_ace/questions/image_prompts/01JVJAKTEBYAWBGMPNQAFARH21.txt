A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a serene park scene in England, bathed in soft, pastel hues reminiscent of a vintage postcard. The composition is centered around a gently rolling green hill, crowned with a majestic, ancient oak tree with sprawling branches. In the foreground, two Norman lords, dressed in finely detailed, historically accurate attire of the 11th-12th century, are leisurely strolling. One lord carries a hunting horn slung across his shoulder, while the other gestures expansively with his hand, seemingly surveying the landscape. A small, winding stream meanders through the park, crossed by a quaint stone bridge. Scattered throughout the scene are grazing deer and rabbits, adding to the pastoral ambiance. In the background, a distant, stylized representation of a Norman castle perched atop a hill, rendered in soft greys and blues, hints at their power and influence. The overall atmosphere should evoke a sense of tranquility, history, and the subtle infusion of Norman culture into the English landscape. The colours should subtly incorporate shades of red, white and blue, reflecting the UK flag, while maintaining a soft, pastel palette. The trees should be lush, the grass vibrant, and the sky a gentle, cloud-strewn blue.
