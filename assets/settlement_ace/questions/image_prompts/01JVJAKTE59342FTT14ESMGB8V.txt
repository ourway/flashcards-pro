A hand-drawn, realistic watercolour illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a stylized courtroom scene bathed in soft, pastel blues and reds reminiscent of the UK flag. The central focus is a set of scales of justice, meticulously detailed and balanced. One pan of the scales holds a collection of diverse religious symbols: a Christian cross, a Star of David, a crescent moon and star, a Dharma wheel, and a Om symbol, all rendered in delicate pastel shades. The other pan depicts a gavel, also in pastel colours, resting firmly on a stack of legal documents, suggesting the weight of legal authority. Behind the scales, a stylized representation of the Houses of Parliament can be seen, fading gently into the background, symbolizing the source of law. The overall composition conveys a sense of solemnity and fairness, with the balanced scales emphasizing the equal importance of religious and ethnic respect under the law. Soft light emanates from behind the scales, highlighting the diversity of symbols and the gavel, drawing the viewer's eye to the core message: that causing harassment, alarm, or distress due to someone's religion or ethnic origin is a serious legal matter. The style should be realistic, detailed and educational, with no cartoonish elements.
