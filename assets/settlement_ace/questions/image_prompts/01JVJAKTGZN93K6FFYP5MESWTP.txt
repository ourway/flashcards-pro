A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical painting. The color palette leans towards pastel hues, subtly incorporating shades of red, white, and blue to reflect the UK flag. The central focus is a stylized, ornate quill pen resting on a partially unrolled parchment scroll. The scroll bears no text but is sealed with a wax seal imprinted with a stylized lion rampant, symbolizing England. Behind the quill and scroll, softly focused but clearly visible, is a depiction of the Tower of London. Sunlight streams through a narrow window in the Tower, illuminating the scene with a gentle, hopeful glow. Chains, broken and lying on the floor near the scroll, suggest the liberation and protection afforded by the Habeas Corpus Act. The composition should evoke a sense of historical importance and the triumph of justice. The overall aesthetic aims for a blend of historical accuracy and artistic beauty, suitable for educational purposes without being overly literal or cartoonish. The scene is set within a stone chamber, suggesting the historical context of legal proceedings.
