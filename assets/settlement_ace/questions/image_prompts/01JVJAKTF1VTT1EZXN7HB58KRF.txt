A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image, ratio 16:9, depicting the allegorical annexation of Wales to England through symbolic representation. The central focus is on two adjacent landmasses, one distinctly representing Wales and the other England, divided by a lightly sketched border that is dissolving. Wales is symbolized by a majestic, emerald-green dragon resting on a bed of daffodils, its posture proud yet yielding. England is depicted as a sturdy, ancient oak tree rooted firmly in rolling green hills, with a regal lion resting at its base. The border area between the two should feature intertwined roots from the oak tree gradually enveloping the dragon's daffodil bed, symbolizing the annexation. Above, a soft, pastel-colored sky blends from a Welsh sunset of deep purples and reds on the left to an English dawn of pale blues and yellows on the right. A single, ornate scroll, representing the Statute of Rhuddlan, unfurls across the sky, its edges subtly blending into the clouds, indicating its impact on the landscape below. The overall color palette should be dominated by the soft pastels, with accents of deep green, red, and gold to emphasize the Welsh and English identities. The style should be realistic, detailed, and evocative of historical maps and heraldic imagery, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements.
