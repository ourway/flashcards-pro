A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D panoramic illustration in a realistic, watercolour style, reminiscent of historical tapestries, depicting a stylized representation of the Bayeux Tapestry, elongated to fit a 16:9 aspect ratio. The central focus features a grand, stylized letter "H", formed by key scenes from the Battle of Hastings. The left vertical stroke of the "H" showcases Norman soldiers, depicted in pastel blues and greys, embarking on ships towards England. The right vertical stroke illustrates the English army, clad in earthy browns and greens, defending their land. The crossbar of the "H" vividly portrays the climatic battle itself, with clashing swords, falling soldiers, and strategically positioned horses. Above the "H," a subtle, ethereal depiction of William the Conqueror's ship sailing towards England is visible. Below the "H," the tapestry continues to depict the aftermath of the battle, including the fleeing English and the crowning of William as king. The overall colour palette leans towards the pastel shades of blue, red, and beige, echoing the traditional colours of the UK flag and the Bayeux Tapestry itself. The edges of the image should appear slightly frayed, mimicking the aged texture of an actual tapestry. Details such as individual stitches are visible to enhance the hand-crafted feel. The composition emphasizes the historical significance and the storytelling aspect of the Battle of Hastings through the symbolic representation of the "H".
