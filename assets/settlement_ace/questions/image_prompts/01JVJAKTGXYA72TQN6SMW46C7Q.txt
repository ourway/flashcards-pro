A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is the iconic clock tower of Big Ben, rendered with careful attention to architectural accuracy, showcasing its neo-Gothic details and the intricate clock face. The colour palette leans towards pastel shades of blue, red, and white, subtly echoing the colours of the UK flag. Big Ben is visually integrated as part of the larger complex of the Houses of Parliament, positioned directly behind and connected to the clock tower. The Houses of Parliament should be depicted with its recognizable towers, spires, and detailed stonework. The River Thames flows gently in the foreground, reflecting the buildings' images with soft ripples. The sky is a gentle gradient of pastel blues and whites, suggesting a clear, bright day. Around Big Ben, include subtle symbolic elements representing the UK: a small, stylized rose (England), a thistle (Scotland), a daffodil (Wales), and a shamrock (Northern Ireland), subtly integrated into the architectural details or the surrounding landscape near the Houses of Parliament. These symbols should be understated and not detract from the main subject. The overall composition should evoke a sense of history, stability, and the central role of Parliament in British life. The absence of text ensures the image focuses on visual learning and recall.
