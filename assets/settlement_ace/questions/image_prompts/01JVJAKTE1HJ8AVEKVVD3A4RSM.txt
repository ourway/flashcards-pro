A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format. The central focus is a gently rolling green landscape bisected by a clearly defined, yet subtly rendered, border. To the left of the border, representing the Republic of Ireland, depict lush, vibrant green fields dotted with traditional stone cottages and grazing sheep. A light, airy sky with fluffy white clouds hangs above. To the right of the border, visually representing the UK, incorporate four distinct yet connected land segments: a rolling English countryside with thatched-roof houses, the Scottish Highlands with majestic mountains and lochs, the Welsh valleys with quaint villages, and the Northern Irish coast with its dramatic cliffs. Each of these segments should subtly incorporate elements of the Union Jack's colors â€“ red poppies in the English fields, a faint blue tint to the Scottish lochs, white-washed Welsh cottages, and red brick buildings along the Northern Irish coast. The border itself should be represented by a low, unassuming stone wall, suggesting a peaceful separation. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel shades, with a focus on greens, blues, whites, and soft reds, evoking a sense of tranquility and geographical distinction. The style should be realistic yet painterly, avoiding harsh lines and embracing soft gradients. The composition should emphasize the distinct visual character of each region while highlighting the clear separation between the Republic of Ireland and the four nations comprising the UK.
