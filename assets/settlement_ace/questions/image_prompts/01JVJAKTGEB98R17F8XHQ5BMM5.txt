A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolour image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a serene, rolling English countryside transitioning from late winter to early spring. The central focus is a winding path, subtly illuminated by the soft, diffused light of dawn. Along the path, forty small, simple crosses are subtly placed, each progressively blooming with tiny spring flowers as the path progresses towards the right side of the image. The crosses on the left side of the path are bare, reflecting the austerity of late winter. The colour palette should transition from cool blues and greys on the left side, representing winter, to warmer pastel shades of green, yellow, and pink on the right, symbolising spring and new life. In the far distance, at the end of the path, a silhouette of a church with a subtly glowing stained-glass window is visible, bathed in a warm, golden light, representing Easter. The sky above is a soft, watercolour wash of pastel blues and pinks, suggesting the hope and renewal associated with the season. A flock of birds is seen flying towards the church, adding a sense of movement and pilgrimage. The overall composition should evoke a feeling of quiet reflection, anticipation, and the passage of time, visually representing the forty days of Lent leading to Easter. The image should be devoid of any text or numbers.
