A breathtaking, hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting the British Isles dramatically separating from the European continent approximately 10,000 years ago. The scene unfolds with a vibrant, pastel colour palette, dominated by blues, greens, and creams to evoke a sense of ancient geological change. The landmass representing Britain is stylized with rolling green hills, reminiscent of the English countryside, and chalky white cliffs along its soon-to-be coastline. A giant number '10' composed of the same chalky material as the cliffs, crumbles and breaks off from the European landmass.

The European side should feature hints of familiar landmarks, though not explicitly detailed, to suggest its continental connection. The separating sea is turbulent, with swirling patterns in varying shades of blue, hinting at the powerful forces at play. Floating debris, such as stylized chunks of ice and rock, litters the water, underscoring the dramatic nature of the event. The sky is a soft, watercolour wash of pastel blues and creams, with subtle hints of sunrise or sunset, casting a warm glow on the separation. The overall composition should emphasize the isolation of Britain, with a clear visual distinction between the newly formed island and the mainland. The artistic style aims for realism while incorporating a touch of fantastical grandeur to capture the significance of this geographical event in British history.
