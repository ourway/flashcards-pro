A hand-drawn, realistic, 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a Christmas pudding aflame. The pudding, round and dark brown with a slightly cracked surface, sits on a festive, patterned china plate. A sprig of holly with bright red berries adorns the top of the pudding. Blue flames flicker upwards, casting a warm, inviting glow. Around the plate, sugared plums and candied orange slices are scattered, adding pops of vibrant color. The background is a soft, diffused blend of pastel blues and creams, resembling a subtly textured tablecloth. The overall composition should evoke a sense of warmth, tradition, and festive cheer, reminiscent of a classic British Christmas scene. The lighting should emphasize the pudding as the focal point, with the flames providing a natural highlight. The image style should be detailed and realistic to aid recognition, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements. The colors should be predominantly pastel, with accents of red, orange, and blue, reflecting a subtle nod to the UK flag's color palette. The 16:9 ratio should center the pudding, plate, and surrounding festive elements.
