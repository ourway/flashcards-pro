A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic, 2D watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a young Mary, Queen of Scots, in a French royal garden. The color palette leans towards pastel hues with subtle hints of blue, white, and red, evoking the colors of both the French and British flags in a subdued manner. Mary, around 8 years old, is centrally positioned in the image, dressed in a historically accurate, elegant dress of the period, perhaps with subtle Scottish tartan accents incorporated into the design. She is holding a partially eaten croissant in one hand and a small book bound in royal blue in the other. The background features a classic French formal garden, complete with precisely manicured hedges, rose bushes bursting with pastel-colored blooms, and a baroque-style fountain gently spraying water. In the distance, a glimpse of a grand French chateau can be seen, its architecture reflecting the opulence of the French court. Symbolic fleur-de-lis motifs are subtly incorporated into the garden design, perhaps as decorative elements on the fountain or as patterns within the hedges. The overall atmosphere is one of refined elegance, youthful innocence, and academic pursuit, designed to evoke a strong association with France and the early life of Mary, Queen of Scots.
