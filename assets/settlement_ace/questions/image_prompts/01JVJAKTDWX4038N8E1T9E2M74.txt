A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in watercolor style, depicting a set of traditional weighing scales, perfectly balanced. The scales are rendered in a classic British style, perhaps with ornate detailing reminiscent of Victorian-era craftsmanship. One side of the scale holds a collection of diverse, stylized figures representing women from various professions - a doctor, a teacher, a businesswoman, an artist, a scientist, all rendered in pastel-colored clothing. Each figure is distinct and contributes equally to the weight on that side. The other side of the scale holds a similar collection of diverse male figures, also in pastel-colored attire, representing their contribution to the workforce. The background is a soft, blurred wash of pastel blue, suggestive of the British sky. The focal point is the balance of the scales, clearly indicating equilibrium. The overall impression is one of harmony and equal representation. The colour palette should mainly use pastel blues, reds, and whites, subtly referencing the UK flag without being overtly patriotic. The style is realistic but softened by the watercolor medium, creating a welcoming and educational visual.
