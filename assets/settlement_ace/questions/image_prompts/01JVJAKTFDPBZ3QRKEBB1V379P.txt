A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a serene, pastel-toned scene. Dominating the center is a grand, classical courthouse building with tall, imposing columns and a peaked roof reminiscent of British architectural style. The courthouse is bathed in soft, early morning light, casting gentle shadows that emphasize its solidity. In front of the courthouse, a winding cobblestone path leads towards the entrance. On either side of the path, stylized scales of justice are depicted, perfectly balanced. One side of the scale shows a pile of coins, coloured in pastel gold and yellow, the other side shows a single key, coloured in pastel grey. The background features a tranquil park with lush green trees and a clear blue sky, subtly incorporating the colors of the UK flag (red, white, and blue) in the flowers blooming in the foreground. The overall composition aims to convey a sense of seriousness and the importance of financial responsibility, while remaining visually appealing and educational. The artwork should avoid any harsh lines or overly dramatic elements, maintaining a soft, approachable aesthetic suitable for learning.
