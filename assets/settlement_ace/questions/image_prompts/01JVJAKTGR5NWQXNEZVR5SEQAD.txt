A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour painting depicting a grand clock tower, reminiscent of Big Ben but with distinct Welsh architectural features such as slate roofing and Celtic knot detailing adorning its face. The clock's face displays the time at precisely one minute past the hour, with the minute hand prominently pointing to the number "1" and the second hand sweeping past the "60" mark. Around the base of the clock tower, a vibrant scene unfolds: a bustling market square filled with people representing diverse backgrounds, symbolizing the Welsh population. Intertwined with the crowd are subtle visual cues alluding to Welsh culture, such as traditional Welsh flags gently waving in the breeze and a street musician playing a traditional Welsh harp. The color palette emphasizes pastel blues, reds, and whites, reminiscent of the UK flag, creating a harmonious and educational image. The overall composition should be balanced, with the clock tower as the central focal point, drawing the viewer's eye to the crucial element: the seconds ticking away, visually linking to the number 60. The sky above the clock tower is a soft, watercolour wash of blues and pinks, adding a dreamy, memorable quality to the scene.
