A meticulously detailed watercolor painting depicting a regal, yet somber, portrait of King Charles I. He is adorned in royal attire, including a dark velvet robe trimmed with ermine and a lace collar. His expression is one of restrained frustration. Behind him, stretching across the background, is a towering, intricately designed grandfather clock. The clock's face is subtly distorted, with the roman numeral "XI" (representing 11) prominently displayed, larger and slightly more vibrant than the other numerals. The clock hands are frozen, pointing to a symbolic moment in time. Eleven faint suns, each diminishing in brightness, are arranged in an arc above the clock, visually representing the passing of eleven years. The color palette should lean towards muted blues, deep reds, and golds, reminiscent of royal tapestries and the British flag. The overall style should evoke a sense of historical drama and the weight of time, capturing the essence of Charles I's period ruling without parliamentary approval. The background should transition from a detailed depiction of the king to a softer, almost dreamlike quality as it moves towards the clock and the suns, creating a visual hierarchy that emphasizes the duration of the eleven years.
