A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape ratio. The scene depicts a gently rolling green hillside in the English countryside, bathed in the soft, diffused light of a slightly overcast day. Seven figures, diverse in age, ethnicity, and attire, stand closely together in the center of the frame. They are arranged to subtly suggest the shape of a cross, with one figure at the top, three across the horizontal bar, and three forming the base. Each figure is rendered with individual detail, their clothing reflecting contemporary British fashion with muted, pastel color tones. Three additional, less detailed figures are positioned slightly behind the main group, fading into the background to represent the remaining 30%. These background figures are also diverse, but their features are softer and less defined. The sky above is a blend of soft blues and grays, hinting at a typical British climate. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades with subtle hints of red, white, and blue, reminiscent of the UK flag. The composition is carefully balanced, drawing the viewer's eye to the central group of seven figures, reinforcing the concept of "70%". The style should evoke a sense of peace, unity, and the diverse nature of modern Britain, all within a traditional, artistic watercolor style.
