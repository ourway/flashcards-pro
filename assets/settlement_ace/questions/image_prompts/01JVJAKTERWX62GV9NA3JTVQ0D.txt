A vibrant, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a theatrical stage bathed in warm, golden spotlight. The stage's backdrop showcases a grand, old-fashioned theatre interior, complete with plush velvet curtains in a deep burgundy hue reminiscent of classic British theaters. In the center of the stage, a large, ornate, golden mousetrap is prominently displayed, its design intricate and Victorian-era. A single, stylized silhouette of a mouse, crafted from a dark, mysterious shadow, is seen approaching the trap cautiously. Around the mousetrap, miniature figures representing audience members are seated in rows, their faces expressing a mixture of shock, anticipation, and intrigue. These figures are dressed in clothing styles spanning from the 1950s to the present day, subtly indicating the play's long run. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with hints of red, white, and blue subtly incorporated to evoke the British flag without being overt. The atmosphere should be one of classic suspense and timeless drama, capturing the essence of Agatha Christie's enduring murder mystery. The composition should draw the viewer's eye to the mousetrap as the central element, symbolizing the captivating and long-running nature of "The Mousetrap."
