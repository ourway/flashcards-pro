A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, presented in a 16:9 landscape format. The scene depicts Sir Robert Walpole, rendered in the style of a formal portrait from the early 18th century. He is positioned centrally, wearing a powdered wig, a dark blue velvet coat with gold embroidery, and a white lace jabot. His posture is confident and slightly imposing. Above and behind Walpole, a subtle, ethereal banner unfurls, coloured in pastel blue and white, bearing no text but visually suggesting an official designation. In the background, a stylized depiction of the Houses of Parliament is visible, rendered in soft, muted pastel tones of white and grey, suggesting the seat of power. At the bottom of the image, a small, ornate table holds an inkwell and quill, alluding to the documentation and record-keeping associated with his office. The overall colour palette leans towards the blues, reds, and whites of the Union Jack, but softened into pastel shades to create a serene and dignified atmosphere. The lighting is soft and diffused, highlighting Walpole's face and the subtle details of his attire, emphasizing his historical importance. The artwork should evoke a sense of historical gravitas and the establishment of a significant political role within the British government.
