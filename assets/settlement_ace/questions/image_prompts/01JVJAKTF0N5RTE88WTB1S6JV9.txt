A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a vintage British naval ship sailing on a calm, cerulean sea. The ship's main mast proudly displays a large, billowing Union Flag (Union Jack). The flag's colours should be vibrant and accurate, showcasing the red, white, and blue of the United Kingdom. The ship itself should be rendered in a muted, pastel color palette, primarily creams, light blues, and grays, to create a sense of historical authenticity and prevent it from overpowering the flag, which is the focal point. The sea should gently reflect the sky, with subtle ripples and highlights. The sky above is a soft gradient of pastel blues and whites, suggesting a clear, bright day. The composition should be centered, with the ship occupying the central space of the 16:9 ratio, emphasizing the prominent display of the Union Flag. The overall feeling should be one of national pride, maritime history, and the enduring symbol of the Union Jack.
