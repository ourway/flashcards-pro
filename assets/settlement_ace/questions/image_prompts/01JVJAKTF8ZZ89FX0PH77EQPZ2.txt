A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D illustration in watercolor style, depicting a serene British countryside scene under a pastel-blue sky. Rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep stretch towards a stately, yet welcoming, manor house in the center of the frame. The manor house is surrounded by vibrant flower gardens in pastel shades of pink, yellow, and lavender. To the left, a rugged coastline featuring iconic white cliffs meets a gentle, turquoise sea. A classic red telephone box and a traditional stone wall subtly incorporate UK elements. In the foreground, a symbolic oak tree stands tall, its branches reaching protectively over the landscape. The overall composition evokes a sense of tranquility, preservation, and the beauty of the British Isles. The style should be realistic, avoiding cartoonish or abstract interpretations, and utilizing a pastel color palette to create a comforting and trustworthy atmosphere. The image should be centered and in 16:9 landscape format.
