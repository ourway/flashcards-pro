A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format depicting the Tower of London. The Tower should dominate the central composition, rendered in shades of grey stone with subtle blue and red undertones echoing the UK flag. The architectural details must be precise, showcasing its historical significance and robust structure. Perched atop the highest tower, subtly gleaming yet not overpowering the scene, should be a stylized representation of the Crown Jewels; a symbolic crown, scepter, and orb. The jewels should be rendered with fine detail, utilizing a pastel color palette of gold, sapphire blue, and ruby red for a touch of regal splendor without being overly gaudy. The River Thames flows gently in the foreground, reflecting the Tower's image and the pastel hues of the sky above. The sky should be a blend of soft blues, pinks, and whites, creating a serene and dignified atmosphere. Around the base of the tower, suggest the presence of Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters) in their traditional scarlet uniforms, adding a human element and a sense of historical context, but keep them small and subtle to not distract from the tower and jewels. The overall impression should be one of grandeur, history, and the enduring legacy of the British monarchy, creating a memorable visual link between the Tower of London and the Crown Jewels, and making it educational.
