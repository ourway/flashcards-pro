A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting depicting a symbolic representation of the United Kingdom's formal adoption of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in 1950. The central image showcases a stylized British lion, rendered in soft, muted blues and grays reminiscent of the UK flag, extending its paw to gently grasp a cluster of doves, each dove representing a signatory nation of the European Convention. The doves are colored in a pastel palette of pinks, yellows, and greens. The lion stands on a foundation of weathered stone blocks, symbolizing the established legal system of the UK. The stone blocks are partially covered in moss, suggesting the passage of time. Behind the lion and doves, a soft-focus background depicts a sunrise over the White Cliffs of Dover, utilizing warm pastel oranges and yellows to symbolize a new era of rights and freedoms. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peace, collaboration, and the historical significance of the UK's commitment to human rights. The style should be realistically detailed, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, and should have a timeless, classic feel, as if taken from the pages of a historical document. The image should be in a 16:9 landscape ratio with the lion and doves centered.
