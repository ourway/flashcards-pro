A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style, ratio 16:9. The scene depicts a brightly lit, classic laboratory setting. Dominating the center is a detailed portrait of Ernest Rutherford, depicted as a strong, determined man in his late 40s, wearing a neatly buttoned lab coat. His face is etched with concentration and scientific curiosity. In front of him, on a sturdy wooden workbench, is a complex arrangement of scientific equipment: glass tubes, wires, and a central device resembling an early particle accelerator. Emanating from this device is a visual representation of an atom being split. The atom is artistically rendered as a shimmering, translucent sphere, with smaller particles visually breaking away in a burst of light and energy. The colour palette should be in pastel colours. Subtle blues and reds are used to suggest the colours of the UK flag. The background includes bookshelves filled with aged scientific texts and diagrams of atomic structures. Lighting is focused on Rutherford and the atom-splitting device, with softer, diffused light elsewhere in the laboratory. The overall impression is one of scientific breakthrough and the revealing of hidden powers, serving as a visual mnemonic for remembering Rutherford's role in splitting the atom.
