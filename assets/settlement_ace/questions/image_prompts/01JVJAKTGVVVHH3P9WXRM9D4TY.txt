A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a grand, ornate British pendulum clock, its face subtly resembling the Houses of Parliament clock tower. The clock's pendulum, rendered in pastel shades of blue and red (echoing the UK flag), swings dynamically between two symbolic emblems positioned on either side of the clock face. On the left, where the pendulum swings towards, is a stylized, majestic oak tree, its roots deeply embedded, representing the Conservative Party's traditional values and connection to the land. The oak tree is depicted with lush green foliage, and the ground around it is subtly textured to resemble rolling hills. On the right, where the pendulum swings to the opposite side, is a stylized, vintage-style miner's lamp, emitting a warm, inviting glow, symbolizing the Labour Party's historical ties to the working class and industrial heritage. The lamp is placed on a textured surface resembling cobblestones. The background is a soft, diffused wash of pastel blue, creating a sense of depth and highlighting the central clock. The clock itself is intricately detailed, with Roman numerals and delicate hands, subtly suggesting the passage of time and the cyclical nature of political power. The overall composition should be balanced and visually appealing, with a focus on clarity and symbolic representation. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel shades, with subtle hints of red, white, and blue.
