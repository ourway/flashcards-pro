A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting the Tower of London as a majestic fortress against a soft, pastel-blue sky. The Tower should be rendered with historical accuracy, showcasing its iconic White Tower at the center, surrounded by the concentric rings of defensive walls and turrets. Positioned prominently within the White Tower, but visible through an arched window, is a dazzling display of the Crown Jewels. The jewels themselves – crowns, scepters, orbs, and swords – should be rendered with intricate detail, glittering with simulated light reflecting off of precious stones in shades of red, blue, green, and gold. The overall color palette should lean towards pastel blues, reds, and whites to evoke the colors of the UK flag, with touches of gold and silver highlighting the regalia. In the foreground, a meticulously drawn Beefeater, standing guard with a halberd, adds a human element and reinforces the Tower's role as a secure location. The composition should be centered, emphasizing the Tower of London as the focal point, with the Crown Jewels subtly visible, creating a visual association between the two. The style should be realistic but with the charm and softness of watercolor, making it visually appealing and memorable for educational purposes. The image should evoke a sense of history, security, and the preciousness of the Crown Jewels.
