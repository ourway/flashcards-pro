A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a pastel color palette (primarily blues, soft reds, and creams) depicting a family tree. The base of the tree is labeled "Great Britain," with three sturdy branches emerging from it. These branches are subtly colored with the St. George's Cross (red cross on a white background), representing England, the Scottish Saltire (white cross on a blue background) for Scotland, and the Welsh Dragon flag (red dragon on a green and white background) for Wales. From the "Great Britain" trunk, a separate, smaller branch extends outwards, subtly colored with the St. Patrick's Saltire (red saltire on a white background) representing Northern Ireland, signifying its distinct yet connected relationship. This smaller branch is clearly connected to the main "Great Britain" trunk, but visually distinct, indicating that they are not identical. The overall composition is centered, with the family tree filling the 16:9 aspect ratio. The background is a soft, blurred wash of pastel blue, resembling a clear sky. The style should evoke a sense of historical importance and familial connection, reminiscent of old family portraits and maps. The image should be easily understood and memorable, highlighting the non-identical relationship between Great Britain and the United Kingdom through the family tree metaphor.
