A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a serene Polish countryside scene abruptly disrupted. The composition is centered on a field of vibrant red poppies swaying gently in the breeze under a pastel blue sky, a quintessential symbol of Poland. In the distance, on the horizon line, dark, ominous storm clouds are gathering, their shapes subtly resembling the silhouette of German warplanes. The normally bright and cheerful field is cast in shadow by the approaching storm. Running through the poppy field is a faint, almost ethereal line representing a border. On the other side of the border, the poppy field abruptly stops and turns into a barren, grey landscape. The overall color palette leans heavily on the red and white of the Polish flag, juxtaposed with the darker greys and blues of the encroaching war. The art style should evoke a sense of foreboding and the loss of innocence, while still maintaining a respectful and educational tone. The image should capture the peaceful beauty of Poland before the invasion, contrasted with the looming threat of war. The poppies should be painted with detailed brushstrokes, capturing the delicate texture of the petals. The storm clouds should have a swirling, turbulent quality, suggesting the chaos and destruction of war. The barren landscape should be empty and desolate, emphasizing the impact of the invasion. The entire scene should be framed to create a sense of depth and perspective.
