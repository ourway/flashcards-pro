A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting a scene set in a quaint English village. The image ratio is 16:9 and landscape orientation. The main subject and idea should be mainly in the center of the image. In the foreground, a slightly oversized, pastel blue poll card is prominently displayed, acting as a signpost. The card is decorated with a simple, elegant illustration of a ballot box with a stylized Union Jack flag subtly incorporated into its design. From the poll card, a winding cobblestone path leads towards a traditional village hall in the background. The village hall is adorned with pastel red and white bunting, suggesting an upcoming election. Villagers, painted in soft, muted tones, are seen strolling along the path, their faces reflecting a sense of civic duty and anticipation. The sky is a gentle, pastel blue, with fluffy white clouds adding depth to the scene. The overall color palette should evoke a sense of tranquility and the importance of democratic participation. The style should be reminiscent of classic English illustrations, focusing on detail and realism. The image should avoid any text and numbers, focusing solely on visual cues to represent the concept of a poll card guiding voters to their polling station.
