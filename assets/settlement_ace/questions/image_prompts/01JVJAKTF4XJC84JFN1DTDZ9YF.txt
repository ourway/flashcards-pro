A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting on high-quality paper, depicting a partially unfurled Union Flag against a soft, pastel blue sky. The flag should be realistically rendered, with subtle variations in color and texture to give it a sense of depth and movement. Three distinct, symbolic crosses should be prominently visible within the flag's design: the white diagonal cross of Saint Andrew (representing Scotland), layered over the red cross of Saint Patrick (representing Ireland), and the red cross of Saint George (representing England) positioned centrally. These three crosses should be depicted with slight variations in their texture and shading to subtly emphasize their distinct identities within the unified design. The fourth corner of the flag should be slightly out of the frame, creating a sense of incompleteness. The colour palette should be pastel, with muted reds, whites, and blues reminiscent of the Union Flag, but softened to create a calming and educational visual. The composition should focus on the central area of the flag, with the three visible crosses arranged in a visually balanced manner. Light should gently illuminate the flag, highlighting the intricate details of the fabric and the subtle variations in color. The overall impression should be one of serene elegance and historical significance, reinforcing the concept of unity through the combination of three distinct crosses.
