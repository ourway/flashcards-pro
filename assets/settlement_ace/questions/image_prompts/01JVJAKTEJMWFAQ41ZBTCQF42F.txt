A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a scene centered around the iconic Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, USA. The bell, slightly aged with a visible crack, sits prominently on a wooden platform, bathed in soft, natural light. Behind the Liberty Bell, a gathering of figures dressed in colonial-era attire are visible, their faces reflecting a mix of determination and hope. The backdrop is a stylized representation of Independence Hall, rendered with careful attention to architectural details, complete with the American flag subtly waving atop. The color palette should lean towards a pastel range, with muted blues, reds, and creams dominating the scene to evoke a sense of historical authenticity and solemnity. The overall composition should aim to capture the moment of declaration, with the Liberty Bell symbolizing the birth of a new nation. The focus should be on creating a visually appealing and historically evocative image that subtly hints at the year 1776 through symbolic elements like the number of people in the crowd or details in the architecture, without explicitly writing the year itself. The scene should be framed within a 16:9 aspect ratio, with the main subject matter concentrated in the center.
