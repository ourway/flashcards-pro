A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of vintage movie posters, depicting Charlie Chaplin as his iconic "Tramp" character. The scene is set against a subtly textured, off-white backdrop, suggesting an old cinema screen. Chaplin, positioned centrally within the 16:9 frame, is dressed in his signature tattered suit, oversized shoes, and bowler hat. He carries his trademark cane, hooked jauntily over his arm. His facial expression is a poignant blend of melancholy and mirth, capturing the essence of the Tramp's persona. The colour palette should primarily use soft, muted pastel tones, with occasional pops of deeper blues and reds to subtly echo the colours of the Union Jack. The lighting should be soft and diffused, creating a nostalgic, dreamlike atmosphere. Focus on detailed rendering of Chaplin's clothing and facial features, conveying the character's vulnerability and resilience. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of timeless charm and the enduring power of silent film, creating a memorable visual cue for the answer.
