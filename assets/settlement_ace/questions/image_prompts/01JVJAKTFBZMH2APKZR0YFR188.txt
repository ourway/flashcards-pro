A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a 16:9 landscape format. The central subject is a solitary figure standing on a stylized version of the White Cliffs of Dover, rendered in soft, chalky whites and pale blues. The figure is dressed in a simple, muted grey suit, conveying neutrality and independence. They are facing the viewer, with a calm and determined expression. Behind the figure, the English Channel stretches out, depicted with gentle, undulating waves in varying shades of pastel blue and grey. Above, the sky is a soft, diffused light blue, with subtle hints of pink and orange near the horizon, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. To the left and right of the central figure, subtly smaller and further away, are stylized representations of the Houses of Parliament, one rendered in a slightly reddish hue and the other in a light, yellowish tone, symbolizing the two main political parties, but distinct and separate from the central figure. A gentle breeze is implied through the slight movement of the figure's hair and clothing, adding a sense of dynamism. The overall color palette should be soft and calming, primarily using pastel shades of blue, grey, and white, with subtle touches of red and yellow to represent the political parties. The composition should emphasize the figure's independence and separation from the established political structures, reinforcing the concept of an MP not affiliated with a primary party. The style should be reminiscent of classic British landscape paintings, with a focus on realism and detail.
