A hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting in a pastel color palette (primarily blues, reds, and creams), depicting an ancient artisan crafting a bronze axe head. The scene is set outdoors near a primitive forge built from stones. The artisan, a muscular man with a beard and wearing simple, earth-toned clothing, carefully pours molten bronze from a clay crucible into a stone mold. Sparks fly from the forge, illuminating his focused expression. Beside him, a finished bronze axe rests on a rough-hewn wooden stump. In the background, rolling green hills dotted with ancient standing stones fade into a misty horizon. The sun is setting, casting a warm, golden glow over the scene, highlighting the bronze's metallic sheen. A simple, stylized timeline is subtly integrated into the landscape: a faint, winding path leading from the distant hills (representing the past) towards the foreground (representing the present), with the forge positioned approximately a quarter of the way along the path, visually indicating the 4,000-year timeframe. The overall composition should evoke a sense of history, craftsmanship, and the dawn of a new era.
