A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of historical paintings. The artwork features William the Conqueror on horseback, positioned centrally within the 16:9 frame. He is depicted as a strong, determined leader, wearing regal Norman armor with subtle blue and red accents, reflecting the colors of the UK flag. In the background, rising majestically, is the Tower of London, depicted as it would have looked during its initial construction phase: a formidable, yet incomplete, stone structure. The sky above is a pastel blue, hinting at the dawn of a new era. Symbolic elements include a blueprint scroll partially unfurled in William's hand, representing his vision and ambition. Around the base of the Tower, stonemasons are shown diligently working, adding to the realism and historical accuracy. The overall composition should convey a sense of power, ambition, and the lasting impact of William the Conqueror on British history. The color palette leans towards pastel shades, with strategic use of blues, reds, and creams to connect the image to the UK flag subtly and maintain a visually appealing aesthetic. The landscape should be rolling green hills typical of the English countryside, dotted with early medieval settlements.
