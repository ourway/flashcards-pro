A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, rendered in a pastel color palette with subtle hints of blue and white to evoke a sense of calm and clarity. The 16:9 landscape composition centers on a windswept Scottish highland scene in late autumn. Dominating the foreground is a weathered stone calendar, its pages fluttering to reveal the date "30" prominently marked in deep blue ink on the November page. A thistle, the national flower of Scotland, is delicately painted beside the calendar, its purple hues contrasting softly against the muted tones of the stone. In the middle ground, a lone bagpiper in traditional Scottish attire stands silhouetted against a setting sun, playing a mournful tune. His kilt features a blue and white tartan pattern. The background features rolling hills fading into a misty horizon, dotted with grazing sheep. The overall atmosphere should be one of quiet contemplation and remembrance, subtly conveying the message that St. Andrew's Day is intrinsically linked to the end of November and not the spring season. The sky should be a blend of soft oranges, pinks, and purples, creating a serene backdrop that emphasizes the solemnity and autumnal nature of the celebration. There should be no text or numbers anywhere else in the image.
