A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolour painting depicting Stonehenge at dawn, set against a backdrop of the Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, England. The colour palette should lean towards pastel shades of blue, grey, and ochre, reminiscent of the UK flag's colours and the natural hues of the stones. The composition should centre on the main circle of standing stones, capturing their weathered textures and the subtle variations in colour caused by centuries of exposure. The sky should be a soft gradient of pastel blues and pinks, hinting at the sunrise. Light should gently illuminate the eastern side of the stones, casting long, subtle shadows that emphasize their size and arrangement. In the foreground, depict a gently rolling green field with subtle wildflowers scattered throughout. The overall style should evoke a sense of mystery, history, and the passage of time, aiming for a serene and awe-inspiring representation of this iconic Stone Age landmark. The level of detail should be high, focusing on accurately rendering the textures of the stones and the natural landscape, reinforcing the 'rocky' and 'henge' aspects of the landmark.
