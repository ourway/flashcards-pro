A watercolor illustration, 16:9 landscape, depicting a softly lit hospital ward during the Crimean War. The scene is dominated by a central figure: Florence Nightingale, rendered in a realistic style, her face showing compassion and focused determination. She holds a traditional oil lamp, its warm glow illuminating the faces of wounded soldiers lying in beds. The ward is clean but spartan, reflecting the conditions of the time. Around the central figure, various scenes of nursing are subtly depicted: a nurse bandaging a wound, another taking a patient's pulse, and another writing notes. The color palette is dominated by muted pastel shades of blue, grey, and beige, with accents of red on the soldiers' uniforms and bandages. The overall mood is one of quiet dedication and care. In the background, a faint outline of a schoolhouse is shown, but it is distant, blurred, and much smaller in scale compared to the main scene in the hospital, subtly emphasizing the focus of Florence Nightingale's work. The lighting should emanate from the lamp, casting soft shadows and highlighting the faces of the patients and nurses, creating a sense of hope and healing amidst the harsh realities of war.
