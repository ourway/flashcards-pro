A tender, hand-drawn watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a lavishly decorated Scottish royal cradle, centrally positioned within a grand, yet softly lit, castle chamber (16:9 ratio). The cradle is draped in rich, crimson fabric, subtly reminiscent of the Scottish flag, with gold embroidered thistle patterns. Nestled inside, resting on a cloud of white lace, is a newborn baby, swaddled in royal blue cloth. The baby's eyes are only slightly open, suggesting its extreme youth. A miniature, ornate golden crown rests gently on the baby's head, almost comically oversized. Soft, pastel lighting illuminates the scene, emanating from a stained-glass window in the background, showcasing a heraldic lion rampant. Around the cradle, faintly sketched in the background, are concerned but hopeful faces of Scottish nobles and ladies-in-waiting, observing the infant queen. The overall composition is designed to evoke a sense of fragility, new beginnings, and the weight of responsibility placed upon such a young child. The color palette should be predominantly pastel blues, reds, and golds, creating a serene and regal atmosphere.
