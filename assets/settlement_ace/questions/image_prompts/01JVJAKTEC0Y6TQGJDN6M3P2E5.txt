A meticulously hand-drawn, 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a grand, stylized oak tree, its trunk representing the UK Parliament. From the main trunk, three substantial branches extend outwards, each representing Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. From the UK Parliament trunk, golden leaves are depicted gently falling, symbolizing powers being 'devolved'. These golden leaves are landing on each of the three branches, where they transform into symbols representing each region: a thistle for Scotland on the first branch, a daffodil for Wales on the second, and a shamrock for Northern Ireland on the third. The leaves should be detailed and distinct. The background is a soft, pastel blue sky with gentle, blurred clouds. The tree's leaves are a mix of greens and golds, with the falling leaves catching the light. The overall color palette should evoke a sense of gentle authority and historical significance, primarily using pastel blues, greens, and golds. The composition should be centered, with the tree filling most of the frame, allowing the details of the falling leaves and regional symbols to be clearly visible. The entire scene should have a peaceful, almost ethereal quality, emphasizing the smooth transfer of power. The oak tree should look majestic, strong and rooted in the ground.
