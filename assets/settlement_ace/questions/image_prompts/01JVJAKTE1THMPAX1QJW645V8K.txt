A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a stylized but historically plausible 18th-century naval battle scene. Two tall sailing ships, one adorned subtly with elements suggesting the Union Jack (hints of red, white and blue in the sails and flags, subtly incorporated into the design, not explicitly the flag itself), and the other with colors suggesting the French flag (similar subtle incorporation of red, white, and blue, but arranged differently), are locked in combat. The ships are positioned centrally within the 16:9 frame, broadside to each other, cannons firing, with plumes of smoke billowing around them. The sea is rendered in shades of deep blue and turquoise, with whitecaps suggesting a turbulent ocean. The sky is a dramatic mix of stormy greys and hints of a pale, diffused sunlight breaking through the clouds. The overall color palette leans towards muted blues, reds, and whites, evoking the era and subtly referencing the UK flag without explicitly displaying it. The composition emphasizes the chaos and intensity of the battle, yet maintains a sense of historical accuracy and artistic beauty. The scene should convey a sense of prolonged conflict and rivalry, but without any depiction of violence or destruction of human life. The style should avoid cartoonish elements, and the overall impression should be one of a detailed historical illustration suitable for educational purposes.
