A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor image in a realistic style, focusing on the concept of global peace maintained by the United Nations. The colour palette should lean towards pastel shades of blue, white, and a muted red, subtly referencing the UK flag without directly replicating it. The central element is a stylized, gentle dove, its wings outstretched, encompassing a softly rendered globe. The globe should feature recognizable, but simplified, landmasses, devoid of harsh lines or political boundaries, emphasizing unity. Radiating outwards from the dove and globe are interconnected, stylized olive branches, symbolizing peace and harmony. The background is a serene, gradient wash of pastel blue, suggesting a clear, hopeful sky. The overall composition should evoke a sense of calm and collaboration, with the dove and globe positioned slightly above the center, conveying aspiration and protection. Avoid any harsh lines or aggressive imagery; instead, focus on soft textures and blending to create a visually soothing and memorable representation of the United Nations' peace-keeping role. The image should be 16:9 ratio and landscape oriented, with the main subject in the center.
