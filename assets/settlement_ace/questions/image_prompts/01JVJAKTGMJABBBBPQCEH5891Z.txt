A watercolor painting in a realistic style, ratio 16:9, depicting a woman gracefully walking through a moonlit garden in England. The garden is filled with roses and lilies, all rendered in soft pastel colors (primarily blues, pinks, and creams). The woman is dressed in a flowing, classical-style gown, primarily in shades of white and pale blue, reminiscent of Grecian attire. Her hair is dark and cascades down her back as she moves. A gentle breeze causes the gown and her hair to sway slightly, adding to the sense of movement and grace. The moon is full and prominent in the night sky, casting a soft, ethereal glow over the scene. The background includes a stately English manor house, partially obscured by trees, suggesting a sense of history and aristocracy. The overall composition aims to capture the essence of beauty, serenity, and graceful movement, reflecting the poem's theme. The color palette is predominantly pastel, with accents of red and blue, subtly echoing the colors of the UK flag. The focus should be on the woman's beauty and her gentle motion, creating a visual representation of the poem "She Walks in Beauty." The artwork should evoke a sense of romanticism and elegance, characteristic of Lord Byron's poetic style.
