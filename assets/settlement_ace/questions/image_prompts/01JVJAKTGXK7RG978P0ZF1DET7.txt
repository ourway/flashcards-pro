A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9, depicting the Houses of Parliament bathed in the soft, pastel hues of dawn. In the foreground, a young woman, clearly 18 years old, stands confidently, holding a symbolic ballot box crafted from polished oak, adorned with a subtle, embossed emblem of the United Kingdom. Light streams from the background, illuminating her face and emphasizing her determined expression. Her attire is a smart, modern business suit, a nod to contemporary British professionalism. A faint, ethereal silhouette of a person much older, perhaps in their late twenties, stands slightly behind her, partially faded, symbolizing the past, when the age restriction was higher. The color palette should be predominantly pastel blues and reds, echoing the colors of the Union Jack, creating a calming yet patriotic atmosphere. The composition should focus on the young woman and the ballot box, placing them centrally within the frame, with the Houses of Parliament providing a stately, yet gentle, backdrop. The overall impression should be one of youthful potential and the democratic process within a modern, accessible Britain. There should be no text present anywhere in the image.
