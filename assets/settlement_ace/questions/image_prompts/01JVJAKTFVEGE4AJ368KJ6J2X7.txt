A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format, portraying two distinct scenarios representing civil law instances. The color palette should lean towards pastel shades and incorporate subtle hints of the UK flag's colors (red, white, and blue) where appropriate. The composition is centrally focused, dividing the scene vertically into two halves. The left half depicts a cozy, yet tense, interior scene: a landlord (depicted as a stern-looking individual in a tweed jacket, holding a document) stands opposite a tenant (a young adult with a worried expression). A partially visible lease agreement rests on a small table between them, symbolizing a dispute over tenancy. The right half illustrates a workplace setting: an employee (of any gender or ethnicity) looks dejected while sitting at a desk. In the background, a shadowy figure (representing a discriminatory employer or colleague) casts a long, unfair shadow over the employee's workspace. The overall mood should be somber yet hopeful, emphasizing the need for legal recourse in such situations. The art style should be detailed and realistic, ensuring clarity and emotional impact, avoiding cartoony or abstract interpretations. Subtle British architectural elements (such as a sash window in the landlord scene or a traditional office lamp in the workplace scene) can be included to subtly ground the image in the UK context. The illustration should be easily understandable and memorable, serving as a visual mnemonic for the concept of civil law disputes.
