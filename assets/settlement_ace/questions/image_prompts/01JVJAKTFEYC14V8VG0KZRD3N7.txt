A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9. The central focus is a portrait of Emmeline Pankhurst, depicted with a determined yet compassionate expression. She is wearing a dark, turn-of-the-century dress with a high collar and a suffragette sash in the iconic colors of purple, white, and green. The sash should be draped elegantly across her chest. Behind her, slightly blurred but still discernible, is a crowd of women marching peacefully, holding banners with symbolic representations of equality, such as scales balanced evenly. The background transitions from a muted, sepia-toned depiction of early 20th-century London streets to a brighter, pastel-colored field of wildflowers in the foreground. These flowers include white daisies (representing purity), purple violets (dignity), and green foliage (hope). A single ray of light shines down from the top left corner, illuminating Pankhurst's face and highlighting the determination in her eyes. The colour palette should be primarily pastel, with accents of purple, white, and green to subtly evoke the suffragette colours. The overall composition should convey a sense of historical significance and the power of peaceful protest. The image should evoke a feeling of respect and admiration for the courage and perseverance of Emmeline Pankhurst and the suffragette movement.
