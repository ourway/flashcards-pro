A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolour illustration in a realistic style, showcasing a quintessential 19th-century Gothic cathedral bathed in the soft glow of a setting sun. The cathedral should be the focal point, occupying the central space of the 16:9 landscape. Its architecture should be prominently displayed, featuring pointed arches, ribbed vaults, flying buttresses, and ornate tracery. Stained glass windows, predominantly in deep blues, reds, and purples reminiscent of the UK flag, filter the sunlight, casting intricate patterns onto the stone floor within. Gargoyles perch menacingly on the roof, their shadows stretching dramatically. The surrounding landscape features a serene English countryside, with rolling green hills in the background and a winding river reflecting the cathedral's majestic silhouette. The colour palette should primarily consist of pastel blues, greys, and purples, interspersed with vibrant stained-glass hues. The overall mood should be awe-inspiring and slightly mystical, capturing the essence of the Gothic revival movement's grandeur and its romantic fascination with the medieval past. The architectural details must be precise and accurate, suitable for educational purposes. The image should evoke a sense of history and cultural significance, subtly reminding the viewer of the architectural trends that defined the 19th century in the UK.
