A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a medieval English village scene under a pall of ominous, swirling black and grey clouds. The village is rendered in muted, pastel tones, with thatched-roof cottages and a central cobblestone square. Dominating the foreground is a skeletal figure cloaked in tattered black robes, representing the Black Death. The figure is not overtly menacing but conveys a sense of inescapable dread. From the figure's outstretched hand emanates a swarm of stylized, dark-grey rats, each leaving a subtle trail of dark particles behind them. Villagers in period attire are scattered throughout the square, some collapsing, others tending to the sick with handkerchiefs covering their faces. The overall composition should be balanced, with the skeletal figure at the central focal point. A subtle red hue should be applied to the setting sun, casting long, distorted shadows across the village to emphasize the despair and mortality of the scene. The art style should be reminiscent of medieval tapestries and illuminated manuscripts, with intricate details in the architecture and clothing. The color palette should primarily consist of pastel blues, greys, and browns, punctuated by the stark black of the central figure and the subtle red of the sunset, referencing the UK flag colours in a muted way. The image should evoke a sense of historical accuracy while maintaining a delicate, educational, and non-frightening tone.
