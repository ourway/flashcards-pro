A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style depicting William Caxton's printing press actively printing 'The Canterbury Tales'. The scene should be set within a historically accurate 15th-century print shop, bathed in the warm glow of candlelight. Caxton himself, dressed in period attire, stands observing the press with a look of focused concentration. The printing press is the central focus, rendered with intricate details showcasing its mechanical complexity. Sheets of parchment are being fed into the press, and freshly printed pages of 'The Canterbury Tales' are stacked neatly nearby. The pages should feature faint, illegible text suggestive of Middle English script. Dominant colors should be muted reds, blues, and creams, reflecting the hues of the UK flag but in a pastel palette, with accents of gold highlighting the importance of the printed text. The composition should emphasize the laborious yet revolutionary nature of the printing process. The background should include details such as ink pots, type trays, and partially printed scrolls, creating a sense of historical authenticity and scholarly endeavor. The lighting should cast soft shadows, adding depth and dimension to the scene and focusing the viewer's attention on the act of printing. The overall impression should be one of historical significance and the dawn of a new era in literature and knowledge dissemination.
