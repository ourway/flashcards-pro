A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic British architectural renderings. The focal point is 10 Downing Street, depicted with accurate architectural details. The door should be dark and prominent, with the number "10" clearly visible but subtly integrated into the door's design rather than being a separate element. The building's facade is rendered in warm, aged stone tones, conveying a sense of history and gravitas. Flanking the entrance are meticulously drawn potted bay trees, adding a touch of greenery. The scene is set on a slightly overcast day, casting soft shadows that accentuate the building's features. In the background, barely visible, are hints of other Georgian buildings, suggesting the street's context. The color palette leans towards muted blues, grays, and creams, echoing the UK flag's colors while maintaining a sense of understated elegance. The overall composition emphasizes the door of Number 10, drawing the viewer's eye and creating a memorable visual association with the Prime Minister's residence and office. The sky should be a pale, washed-out blue, hinting at typical British weather. The image should evoke a sense of quiet authority and historical significance.
