A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, ratio 16:9, depicting a vibrant yet serene scene set in a quintessential 18th-century Edinburgh café. The color palette leans towards pastel blues, reds, and creams, subtly echoing the UK flag's colors. At the center, Adam Smith and David Hume are engrossed in a lively discussion. Smith, portrayed with a thoughtful expression and holding a quill, gestures animatedly towards a partially written manuscript on the table—symbolizing "The Wealth of Nations." Hume, with a calm demeanor, listens intently, a gentle smile gracing his lips, and a hand resting on a book titled "A Treatise of Human Nature." The café setting is richly detailed, featuring period-appropriate furniture, including dark wood tables and chairs. Soft, natural light streams through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the intellectual atmosphere. In the background, other patrons are seen engaged in quiet conversations, some reading books or newspapers, all contributing to the ambiance of intellectual curiosity and debate. Teacups and saucers are scattered on the tables, with steam subtly rising, adding a touch of realism. The overall composition is designed to evoke a sense of historical authenticity and intellectual vibrancy, capturing the essence of the Enlightenment era and the pivotal roles Smith and Hume played in shaping it. The image should be artistically engaging and easy to understand, serving as a visual mnemonic for the correct answer.
