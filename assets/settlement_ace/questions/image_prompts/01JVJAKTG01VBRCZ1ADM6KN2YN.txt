A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of vintage geographical maps and botanical illustrations. The canvas, in a 16:9 ratio and landscape orientation, is dominated by two central islands, each distinctly labeled only through visual cues, avoiding any text. The island on the left, representing the Falkland Islands, features rugged, windswept terrain with a flock of stylized, hand-drawn sheep grazing peacefully on the green pastureland. Scattered across the landscape are distinct rock formations, hinting at the islands' unique geology. A stylized albatross soars gracefully overhead. The island on the right, representing St Helena, showcases a more tropical environment with lush, verdant vegetation and steep volcanic cliffs. Endemic flora, such as the St Helena ebony and the St Helena olive, are depicted with botanical accuracy. A wirebird, unique to St Helena, is perched on a branch. The surrounding ocean is rendered in varying shades of blue, with subtle wave patterns that suggest the vastness of the South Atlantic. A faint, antique map-like texture overlays the entire image, enhancing its educational and historical feel. The color palette leans towards pastel hues interspersed with the red and blue from the UK flag, creating a visually appealing and memorable mnemonic for the correct answer.
