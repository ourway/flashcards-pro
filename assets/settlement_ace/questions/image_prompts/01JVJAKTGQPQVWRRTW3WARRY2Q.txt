A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style (16:9 ratio). The scene depicts a horse race across the British countryside. The foreground shows four horses with jockeys racing towards a clear finish line. Each jockey wears brightly colored silks, predominantly in pastel shades of blue, red, yellow, and green. The horse in the lead is slightly ahead of the others, its jockey looking determined. The finish line is marked by two traditional wooden posts with a red and white checkered tape stretched between them. The background features rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep, a quintessential British landscape. A small, quaint village with stone houses and a church steeple is nestled in the distance. The sky is a soft blue with fluffy white clouds. The overall color palette leans towards pastel tones, creating a gentle and inviting scene. The composition focuses on the horse race, emphasizing the concept of "first past the post." The style is realistic, avoiding cartoonish features, and aims for a visually appealing and memorable image that associates the racing concept with the UK's electoral system.
