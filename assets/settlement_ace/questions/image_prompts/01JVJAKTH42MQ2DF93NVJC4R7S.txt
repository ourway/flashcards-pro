A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a grand, yet intimate, meeting within a medieval-era stone castle hall. The scene is bathed in soft, natural light streaming through arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. At the center sits a regal king, adorned in a crimson robe with gold embroidery, his expression thoughtful and slightly burdened. He gestures gently with his hand. Surrounding him in a semi-circle are a group of advisors, each distinct in their appearance and attire. One is a scholarly looking man in a dark blue robe, holding a scroll; another a knight in shining armor, his helmet resting on the floor beside him; a third, a robed cleric with a kind face. The overall color scheme leans towards pastel shades of blue, red and gold. The background includes subtle details such as tapestries depicting historical scenes, wooden beams supporting the high ceiling, and a large round table in the center of the room, symbolizing unity and shared decision-making. The composition is balanced, drawing the eye towards the King and his council, emphasizing their crucial role in the origins of the British Parliament. The image evokes a sense of history, wisdom, and the birth of a significant institution.
