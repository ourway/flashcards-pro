A watercolor illustration in a realistic style, capturing the essence of devolved powers within the UK. The composition is divided into four distinct panels, each representing a constituent country: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The central focus is on Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, depicted with symbols of lawmaking and governance. Scotland's panel showcases a university building alongside medical staff, symbolizing their power over education and healthcare. The Welsh panel features a dragon holding a scroll with a caduceus next to it, illustrating healthcare policy and cultural identity. Northern Ireland's panel displays the Belfast City Hall combined with a green field and livestock, representing agriculture and local governance. These three panels are brightly colored in pastel greens, blues, and purples, emphasizing their active roles. England's panel, situated slightly off-center, is rendered in muted grey and beige tones. This panel features the Houses of Parliament, but with a more subdued palette, signifying the UK Parliament's overarching role. The overall art style evokes a sense of traditional British artistry with a modern educational twist, using pastel colors to create a visually appealing and informative image. The landscape orientation and 16:9 ratio ensure the image is well-suited for educational displays, with the main idea concentrated in the center.
