A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting Joseph Turner standing on a rocky coastline, his back partially turned to the viewer. He is holding a palette and brush, intently focused on capturing the scene before him. The scene is a vibrant, dramatic sunset over the sea. The sky is ablaze with hues of orange, red, and yellow, reflecting off the water's surface in shimmering patterns. The coastline is rugged and textured, with detailed depictions of rocks, sea foam, and distant cliffs. Turner is dressed in period-appropriate attire, perhaps a dark coat and a cravat. His easel is positioned firmly on the rocks. The overall color palette leans towards warm, pastel tones, with some stronger contrasting reds and oranges in the sky. The composition should emphasize the vastness of the landscape and the interplay of light and shadow. The horizon line is slightly below the middle of the frame to emphasize the sky. The art style should evoke the feeling of 19th-century Romanticism, emphasizing the sublime beauty of nature.
