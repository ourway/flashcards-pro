A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor painting in a realistic style, depicting a serene yet symbolic scene of the Wars of the Roses' conclusion. The composition is centered on a battlefield transitioning into a blooming rose garden. The left side of the image shows a stylized battlefield, rendered in muted greys and blues. Fallen, but not explicitly graphic, medieval weaponry (swords, shields with heraldic symbols) lay scattered on the ground. The ground is barren earth. The right side of the image dramatically transforms into a lush rose garden, vibrant with red and white roses, symbolizing the Houses of Lancaster and York uniting. The roses are incredibly detailed, with visible water droplets on their petals, creating a sense of freshness and renewal. A single, antique sundial stands at the dividing line between the battlefield and the garden, its shadow subtly pointing towards the "85" minute mark, though the numerals themselves are absent. The background features a soft, pastel-colored sky in hues of dawn pink and light blue, suggesting the end of a dark period and the beginning of a new era. A subtle mist hangs over the battlefield, adding depth and atmosphere. A single Tudor rose bush, a symbol of the union of the two houses, is prominently featured in the center, its petals a blend of red and white, creating a visually striking focal point. The overall color palette leans towards pastel shades, with strategic use of red and white to emphasize the rose symbolism, subtly mirroring the colors of the UK flag, while maintaining a gentle, educational tone. The style should evoke historical paintings, with attention to detail and realistic rendering of textures and light.
