A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a dove of peace soaring above a stylized globe. The globe is not a literal representation, but rather an artistic interpretation featuring interconnected landmasses subtly colored in pastel hues of blue, pink, and cream, symbolizing the Earth's nations. Tiny, stylized olive branches sprout from these landmasses, intertwining to form a delicate network across the globe. Below the globe, a group of diverse figures, each representing a different culture and ethnicity, stand shoulder-to-shoulder, holding hands. Their clothing incorporates subtle patterns inspired by traditional textiles from around the world. Above them, the dove carries a banner created from interwoven ribbons colored in muted shades of red, white, and blue, reminiscent of the UK flag, but in a softer, pastel palette. The background is a serene sky painted in watercolor washes of pale blue and pink, giving a sense of hope and tranquility. The overall composition emphasizes unity and global harmony, aiming to create a memorable visual mnemonic for the United Nations' goal of preventing war and promoting international peace and security. The art style evokes a sense of classic, timeless illustration, suitable for educational purposes.
