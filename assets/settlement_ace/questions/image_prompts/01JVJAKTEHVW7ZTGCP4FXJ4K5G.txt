A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn, 2D watercolour illustration in a realistic style, depicting a grand, ornate quill pen hovering above a parchment scroll. The scroll is partially unfurled, revealing faint, elegant calligraphy suggesting legal text but no readable words. Dominating the center of the composition is a stylized, symbolic depiction of the British Parliament: the Houses of Parliament subtly rendered as a sturdy, unwavering foundation upon which the scroll rests. Above the scroll and quill, a regal, but dimmed, crown floats, its light subtly less intense than the glow emanating from the Parliament depiction below. Delicate chains, seemingly made of light, extend from the crown downwards, gently tethering it to the Parliament, symbolizing limitations. The colour palette should primarily utilize muted pastel shades of blue, red, and white, reminiscent of the Union Jack, but softened for a gentler, more historical feel. The background is a soft, diffused wash of parchment colour, giving the impression of age and historical significance. The quill pen should be richly detailed, with subtle variations in its feathering, highlighting the importance of the written word in establishing rights. The overall composition aims to evoke a sense of balance, order, and the establishment of clear boundaries, with the Parliament visually anchoring the scene and the subdued crown indicating the limits placed upon its power.
