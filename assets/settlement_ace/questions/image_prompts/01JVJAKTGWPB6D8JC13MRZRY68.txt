A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustration in a realistic style, depicting a Roman soldier sadly departing a misty, green, and rolling British landscape. The soldier, clad in historically accurate Roman armor with a red plume on his helmet, is turning his back to a weathered stone Roman archway overgrown with ivy. He carries a standard bearing a faded Roman emblem, symbolizing their empire's presence. The archway, a remnant of Roman construction, stands amidst a field of Celtic knot-patterned grass, subtly hinting at the blending of cultures during the Roman occupation. A winding, ancient Roman road disappears into the distance, suggesting a long period of influence. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, greens, and browns to evoke a sense of history and melancholy, with touches of faded red on the soldier's attire and the standard. Three prominent, stylized cracks are visible on the archway, symbolizing the fracturing and eventual end of Roman rule. The scene is set under a cloudy sky, with a faint sunrise breaking through, representing the dawn of a new era after the Romans' departure. The composition focuses on the departing soldier and the crumbling archway, emphasizing the theme of leaving and the passage of time, visually representing the fact that the roman occupation was not 300 years, but over 400 years.
