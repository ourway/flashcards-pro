A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style, ratio 16:9. The central composition depicts a split scene, divided vertically. On the left side, a bustling city street scene with people walking on the pavement, a red double-decker bus filled with passengers, and a train partially visible entering a station. The air above is clear and bright, with subtle pastel blue and white hues suggesting a clean environment. Stylized, green trees line the street, and a few bicycles are visible. On the right side, a congested road filled with various cars, mostly red, white, and blue (resembling the UK flag colours), emitting grey exhaust fumes. The air above this side is murky and grey, suggesting pollution. The background on the left shows iconic London architecture in soft, pastel colours. The background on the right is obscured by smog. The overall art style should be reminiscent of a classic travel poster, emphasizing the contrast between eco-friendly transport and car pollution. The intention is to create a visual representation of the positive impact of walking and public transport on the environment, using a clear and easily understandable composition.
