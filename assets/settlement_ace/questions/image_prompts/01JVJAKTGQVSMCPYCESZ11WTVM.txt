A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration depicting the British Isles with a clear visual distinction for the Channel Islands. The main island of Great Britain is colored in a soft, pastel blue, reminiscent of the UK flag's blue. Ireland is depicted in pastel green, reflecting its landscape. The Channel Islands, positioned south of mainland Britain near the French coast, are rendered in a contrasting, muted pastel yellow. A thin, dotted line extends from the mainland UK towards the Channel Islands, visually suggesting a connection but not a full inclusion. Above the Channel Islands, a delicately drawn, stylized royal crown hovers, symbolizing the "Crown dependency" status. A gentle, stylized wave pattern surrounds all the islands, representing the sea and their geographical separation. The overall composition is centered, with a 16:9 aspect ratio, emphasizing the relative location of the Channel Islands to the UK. The art style should be realistic but with a soft, educational feel, avoiding harsh lines or overly simplistic cartoonish features. The color palette should primarily use pastel shades of blue, green, and yellow, creating a calming and memorable image. The image should convey a sense of proximity and connection without implying complete integration.
