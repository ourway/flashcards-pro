A hand-drawn, realistic watercolour painting in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a scene of empowerment and determination. The central focus is a group of diverse women, shoulder-to-shoulder, marching forward with resolute expressions. They are dressed in early 20th-century attire, reflecting the historical period of the suffragette movement. Predominant colours are pastel shades of purple, white, and green â€“ the colours of the Women's Social and Political Union. Soft, diffused lighting creates an atmosphere of hope and progress. In the background, a faint outline of the Houses of Parliament can be seen, symbolizing the political arena they were striving to influence. Subtle details include banners and sashes with no text, only symbolic representations of equality. The overall composition emphasizes unity and the unwavering spirit of the women fighting for their right to vote, creating a memorable visual association with the term 'suffragettes'.
