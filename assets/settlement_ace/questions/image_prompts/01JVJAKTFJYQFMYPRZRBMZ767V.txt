A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolor style, depicting Boudicca, the warrior queen of the Iceni tribe, leading her forces against the Roman army. The image is in a 16:9 landscape format. Boudicca is the central figure, positioned slightly off-center to the left. She is portrayed as a strong, determined woman with long, flowing red hair, adorned with simple Celtic jewelry. She wears tribal war paint in blue woad across her face and arms, and is clad in simple, functional Celtic clothing - a woolen tunic, leather bracers, and perhaps a cloak fastened with a brooch. She is standing on a simple chariot pulled by two horses. Her posture is commanding, her gaze fixed on the Roman legions in the distance. In her right hand, she wields a spear, raised in a gesture of defiance.

To the right, filling the rest of the frame, are the ranks of the Iceni warriors, a mix of men and women, armed with spears, swords, and shields. Their faces are also painted with woad, conveying a sense of unity and determination. In the far background, a line of Roman soldiers is visible, their disciplined ranks contrasting with the more organic formation of the Celtic warriors. The scene is set in a grassy, open field, perhaps somewhere in East Anglia. The sky is overcast, with hints of a stormy, dramatic atmosphere. The color palette leans towards earthy tones – browns, greens, and grays – with splashes of red in Boudicca's hair and the war paint on the warriors. The overall mood is one of impending conflict, courage, and resistance against a powerful empire. The image must be educational and inspiring, focusing on the bravery and leadership of Boudicca.
