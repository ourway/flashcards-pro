A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting the Speaker of the House of Commons. The central figure is a distinguished individual in traditional Speaker attire: a black gown and a white wig. The Speaker is positioned standing in front of a slightly blurred backdrop of the Houses of Parliament. Above the Speaker's head, subtly floating but clearly visible, are two distinct hats. One is a formal, ornate Speaker's hat, symbolizing their role as the presiding officer. The second hat is a commoner's hat, a simple, yet dignified hat representing the Speaker's role as a Member of Parliament representing a constituency. This hat is slightly tilted and worn, implying the responsibility to represent the public. Pastel colours of light blue and beige should dominate the colour palette, with subtle hints of red in the parliamentary backdrop. The composition should be balanced, placing equal emphasis on both hats and the Speaker's face. The overall impression is one of solemnity, responsibility, and the duality of the Speaker's role.
