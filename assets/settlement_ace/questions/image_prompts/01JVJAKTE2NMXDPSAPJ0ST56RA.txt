A hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor illustration in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting a serene Scandinavian fjord scene at dawn. In the center, two Viking longboats are setting sail, one originating from a Norwegian fjord on the left and the other from a Danish coast on the right. The Norwegian fjord is characterized by steep, snow-capped mountains in the background, with a small, traditional wooden village nestled along the shoreline. The longboat departing from Norway is adorned with a dragon head figurehead painted in deep red and its sail is striped with blue and white, reminiscent of the Norwegian flag. On the right, the Danish coast is flatter, with rolling green hills and a scattering of ancient rune stones. The Danish longboat has a simpler design, with a raven figurehead in black and its sail is striped with white and red, echoing the Danish flag. The sun is just beginning to rise, casting a soft, pastel-colored glow (primarily blues, pinks, and whites) over the scene, reflecting on the calm waters of the fjord and the sea. The water should be clear enough to see the reflection of the boats and the surrounding landscapes. The overall atmosphere should be peaceful yet evocative of adventure and exploration, capturing the historical context of Viking voyages originating from Norway and Denmark.
