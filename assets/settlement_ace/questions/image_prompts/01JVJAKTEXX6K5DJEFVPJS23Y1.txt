A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style, ratio 16:9, depicting a quintessential Halloween scene set against a backdrop of a twilight sky painted in pastel oranges, purples, and blues. In the centre, a silhouette of a classic haunted house sits atop a gently sloping hill, its windows glowing with an eerie yellow light. A winding path leads up to the house, lined with cartoonishly oversized pumpkins carved with various spooky faces – some smiling, some frowning, all illuminated from within by candlelight. A group of children dressed in Halloween costumes – a witch, a ghost, a vampire, and a werewolf – are trick-or-treating, their bags overflowing with candy. A full moon, tinged with a pastel blue hue, dominates the upper-centre of the image, casting long, dramatic shadows. Bare, gnarled trees with twisted branches frame the scene on either side, their silhouettes adding to the spooky atmosphere. Wisps of mist curl around the base of the hill, enhancing the sense of mystery and foreboding. The overall colour palette should lean towards pastel shades reminiscent of a vintage Halloween postcard, with accents of orange, purple, and deep blue to create contrast and visual interest. The style should evoke a sense of nostalgia and childhood wonder, capturing the excitement and thrill of Halloween night. The scene should be rich in detail, with textures and patterns that invite the viewer to linger and explore.
