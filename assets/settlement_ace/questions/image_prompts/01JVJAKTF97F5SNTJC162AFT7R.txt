A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style, depicting a vibrant community garden in the heart of a quaint British village. The garden is thriving with colourful flowers and vegetables, arranged in neat rows. In the center, a diverse group of people, representing different ages and ethnicities, are actively engaged in various gardening tasks. An elderly woman is carefully planting seedlings, a young man is watering the plants with a watering can, and a family is harvesting ripe tomatoes. The overall colour palette leans towards pastel shades of red, white, and blue, reminiscent of the UK flag. The background features charming brick houses with neatly trimmed hedges and blooming window boxes. The garden is enclosed by a traditional stone wall, symbolizing the boundaries of the community. The image should evoke a sense of unity, cooperation, and positive contribution. The composition should be balanced, with the central focus on the people working together in the garden. Sunlight filters through the leaves, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The art style should be realistic and detailed, capturing the textures of the plants, the expressions on the people's faces, and the overall charm of the British countryside.
