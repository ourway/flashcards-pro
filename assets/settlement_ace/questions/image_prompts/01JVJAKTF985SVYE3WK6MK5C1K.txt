A meticulously detailed, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a historical painting. The scene depicts King Charles II in regal attire, standing confidently with one foot in Scotland and the other in England. The Scottish side of the image features a rolling, green landscape with traditional stone buildings and a distant loch, rendered in muted greens and browns. A single thistle, subtly placed, lies near his foot. The English side showcases a more cultivated landscape, with hints of London's skyline in the background, including a recognizable, yet simplified, depiction of the Tower of London. The color palette leans towards a pastel scheme, dominated by blues, creams, and gentle reds, subtly echoing the colours of the Union Jack. Charles II himself is dressed in a royal blue coat, with a cream-colored lace collar. He holds a sceptre topped with a subtle rose and thistle emblem, symbolizing the unification. Light should fall dramatically on the King, highlighting his confident expression. The overall composition should communicate a sense of restored order and unified rule, emphasizing the year 1660 through symbolic elements like oak leaves subtly woven into his crown (referencing the Royal Oak). The image should convey the historical significance of Charles II's restoration to the throne, underlining his connection to both Scotland and England without any text. The entire image should have a warm, inviting feel, conducive to learning and recall.
