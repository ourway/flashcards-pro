A heartwarming, hand-drawn, watercolor illustration in a realistic style, reminiscent of classic storybook art. The scene depicts a softly lit, cozy, and inviting living room interior during a New Year's Eve celebration in the UK. Dominant colors should be pastel shades of blue, red, and white, subtly echoing the UK flag, with warm accents of gold and amber from the fireplace and candlelight. The central focus is a group of diverse individuals, old and young, standing in a circle, holding hands, with expressions of joy and nostalgia on their faces. They are dressed in a mix of traditional and modern winter attire. An open book of sheet music rests on a nearby antique piano, clearly showing musical notes. In the background, a window reveals a snowy landscape with distant fireworks softly illuminating the night sky. The overall atmosphere should evoke feelings of warmth, friendship, remembrance, and the passage of time, subtly hinting at the "old" in "Auld Lang Syne." Include details such as a grandfather clock gently ticking in the corner, a partially decorated Christmas tree suggesting the festive season, and a steaming teapot on a nearby table, all contributing to the sense of a cherished and timeless tradition. The composition should be balanced and harmonious, drawing the viewer's eye to the circle of people and the emotions they are sharing.
