A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic watercolor painting (16:9 ratio) depicting a solitary figure, Hamlet, in a moment of profound contemplation. The scene is set within a grand, yet slightly decaying, hall reminiscent of Elsinore Castle, with high arched windows casting long, dramatic shadows across the stone floor. Hamlet, dressed in dark, melancholic attire with subtle pastel shades of blue and grey, stands center-frame, holding a skull in his left hand. His gaze is directed downwards, a pensive expression etched upon his face. The background features subtle details like faded tapestries depicting scenes of Danish royalty and a barely visible, ghostly figure lurking in the shadows near a distant doorway, hinting at the supernatural elements within the play. A single, flickering candle on a nearby table casts a soft, warm glow on Hamlet's face, contrasting with the cool tones of the castle walls. The overall color palette leans towards muted blues, greys, and browns, punctuated by the warm yellow of the candlelight and the ivory of the skull, creating a somber yet captivating atmosphere that encapsulates the essence of Hamlet's famous soliloquy and the play's exploration of mortality and existence. The composition should emphasize the figure's isolation and internal struggle.
