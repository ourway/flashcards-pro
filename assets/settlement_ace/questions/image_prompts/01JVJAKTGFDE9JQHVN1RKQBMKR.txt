A meticulously hand-drawn, watercolor-style image in a 16:9 landscape format, depicting the Welsh Assembly building in Cardiff, Wales. The building should be rendered with realistic architectural detail, showcasing its modern design with glass and Welsh slate elements. The color palette should consist of pastel blues, greens, and whites, subtly echoing the Welsh flag. In the foreground, a friendly-looking, uniformed staff member stands near a stylized information desk, handing a symbolic 'Access All Areas' pass to a diverse group of smiling visitors. The pass is intricately designed with a dragon emblem, a national symbol of Wales. Behind the staff member, a softly glowing, ethereal light emanates from the Assembly building, suggesting openness and accessibility. The overall composition should convey a sense of welcome and easy access to the Welsh Assembly, emphasizing the importance of the Assembly Booking Service. The background should feature rolling green hills and a clear blue sky with wispy clouds, representative of the Welsh landscape. The style should be realistic and detailed, avoiding cartoonish or abstract elements, with a focus on creating a visually appealing and memorable image that highlights the accessibility of the Welsh Assembly through its booking service.
