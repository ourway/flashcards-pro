A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style, ratio 16:9, depicting a stylized, ornate crown resting gently atop a globe. The globe is predominantly blue and green, representing the Earth, with landmasses subtly outlined. The crown is crafted with intricate detail, showcasing various precious gems in red, white and blue hues, reminiscent of the Union Jack colours. Light reflects realistically off the gems and metallic surfaces of the crown, adding depth and dimension. The background is a soft, gradient wash of pastel blues and whites, creating a serene and ethereal atmosphere. The globe and crown are centrally positioned, commanding attention. Symbolic rays of light emanate outwards from the crown, subtly suggesting influence and leadership. The overall composition evokes a sense of history, tradition, and global connection, reflecting the Commonwealth's nature. The artwork should be detailed and realistic, emphasizing the textures of the globe and the craftsmanship of the crown, using a pastel colour palette where possible.
