A hand-drawn, realistic 2D image in a watercolour style, depicting King Henry VIII standing prominently in the centre. He is adorned in royal attire, including a red and gold robe, a jeweled crown, and holding a scepter. His expression is stern but slightly melancholic. Behind Henry, a grand Tudor-style archway leads to two distinct scenes on either side. To Henry's left, within the archway, depict a faint, ethereal image of the Pope seated on his throne, with a symbolic "no" symbol subtly overlaying him (a red circle with a diagonal line). To Henry's right, within the archway, illustrate a newly constructed cathedral bathed in golden light, symbolizing the Church of England. The cathedral should appear strong and independent. The colours should be in a pastel colour palette, with dominant hues of light blue, soft pink, and creamy white to evoke a sense of historical elegance and solemnity. The composition should emphasize the division caused by the divorce issue, with Henry VIII acting as the central figure caught between the authority of the Pope and the creation of his own church. The art style should be reminiscent of historical portraiture, with meticulous attention to detail in the clothing, architecture, and facial expressions, avoiding any cartoonish or abstract elements.
