A serene, hand-drawn 2D image in a realistic style, reminiscent of a vintage botanical illustration, utilizing a pastel color palette with subtle hints of red, white, and blue. The central focus is on a close-up of a person's head and shoulders, viewed from the side. The individual has dark hair and skin, suggesting Indian ethnicity. Their eyes are closed in peaceful relaxation. A pair of hands, slightly blurred to indicate motion, are gently massaging the scalp with oil. The hands belong to another individual, only partially visible, dressed in traditional Indian clothing. The background features stylized representations of Ayurvedic herbs and spices – neem leaves, sandalwood, turmeric root – depicted in delicate watercolor washes. The composition should evoke a sense of calm and well-being. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The overall effect should subtly communicate the historical connection between "shampooing" and the Indian art of head massage, emphasizing the sensory experience and traditional roots. The image is framed in a 16:9 ratio, with the main subject matter centered, allowing for a balanced and visually appealing composition.
