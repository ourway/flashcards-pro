A meticulously detailed, realistic watercolor painting depicting the iconic Scottish Highlands as a backdrop to a grand, neoclassical courthouse. The courthouse, rendered in shades of grey stone with subtle blue undertones, dominates the central composition, its architecture imposing yet elegant. A winding road, in pastel blue, leads up to the courthouse entrance, subtly resembling a river. Above the courthouse, a dramatic sky with swirling clouds in hues of blue and grey, reminiscent of the Scottish flag, adds a sense of gravity and importance. In the foreground, a single, majestic Scottish thistle, painted in shades of purple and green, stands tall, its thorny leaves meticulously detailed. The overall color palette leans towards pastel blues, greys, and purples, evoking a sense of solemnity and tradition. The style should be reminiscent of a classic landscape painting, with a focus on realism and attention to detail. The intention is to convey the idea of the "High Court" through the majestic setting and the prominent thistle, a national symbol of Scotland, creating a memorable visual association for the test-taker. The image should be framed in a 16:9 format, with the courthouse centered to emphasize its significance.
