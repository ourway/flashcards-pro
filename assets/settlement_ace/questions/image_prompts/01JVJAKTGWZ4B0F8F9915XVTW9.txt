A meticulously hand-drawn, realistic 2D watercolor painting in a pastel color palette (primarily blues, creams, and light reds) depicting the London Eye Ferris wheel. The London Eye is positioned centrally in the frame, its circular form dominating the composition. Several capsules are visible, each containing miniature figures gazing outwards. Below the London Eye flows the River Thames, rendered with gentle ripples and reflections. Small stylized boats, reminiscent of classic river cruisers, navigate the waterway. The banks of the Thames are lined with iconic London landmarks, subtly suggested in the background in a pale wash of color - perhaps a glimpse of the Houses of Parliament or the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral. The sky above is a soft, graduated blue, with a few wispy pastel clouds. The overall atmosphere is bright, cheerful, and inviting, evoking a sense of gentle, observational tourism. The artwork style should be reminiscent of a travel poster, with clean lines and a focus on capturing the essence of a classic London scene. The colors should be muted, creating a sense of timelessness and elegance.
