A hand-drawn, watercolor-style 2D image in a 16:9 landscape format depicting a serene, rolling green landscape of Northern Ireland. In the center, a majestic Celtic cross stands bathed in soft sunlight, its intricate carvings highlighted with pastel blues and greens. At the base of the cross, shamrocks grow abundantly, their three leaves rendered in varying shades of emerald. Positioned slightly to the left of the cross is a gentle, stylized figure of St. Patrick, dressed in simple robes, holding a bishop's staff. He exudes a peaceful demeanor, with a subtle halo around his head. To the right of the cross, partially obscured by the cross's shadow, is a faint, ghostly image of St. George's flag (a red cross on a white background), symbolizing England. The overall color palette leans heavily on pastel greens, blues, and whites, reminiscent of the Irish countryside and the UK flag. The sky above is a soft, watercolor wash of pale blue, suggesting a calm and contemplative atmosphere. The art style should be realistic and detailed, resembling a classic watercolor painting, yet maintaining a soft, approachable aesthetic suitable for educational purposes. This image should evoke a sense of peace, history, and cultural identity.
