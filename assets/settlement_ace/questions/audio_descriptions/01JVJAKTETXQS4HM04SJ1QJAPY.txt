Boxing Day, celebrated on December 26th, has a couple of interesting origin stories. One popular theory links it to the Victorian era, where wealthy landowners would box up gifts and leftover food to give to their servants and employees the day after Christmas. This was a gesture of goodwill and allowed servants to visit their families, as they were usually working on Christmas Day itself. Another theory suggests it stems from the tradition of churches opening their alms boxes, collecting money for the poor, on December 26th. Regardless of the exact origin, Boxing Day is traditionally a day for giving to those in need and spending time with family and friends. So, while Christmas Day is the 25th, Boxing Day always follows directly after, making the 26th of December the correct answer. It's not the day before Christmas (24th) or a day later (27th) â€“ it's that immediate post-Christmas day of goodwill.
