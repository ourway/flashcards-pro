The Magna Carta, often called the Great Charter, is a foundational document in the history of British law and democracy. Think of it as a really important agreement made way back in 1215. King John, who wasn't a very popular ruler, was facing rebellion from his barons. They were fed up with his heavy taxes and abuse of power. So, they forced him to sign the Magna Carta at Runnymede. Now, what's so special about it? Well, it limited the king's power for the first time and established principles like due process and the idea that everyone, even the king, is subject to the law. It didn't create democracy overnight, but it was a crucial step in that direction. While other dates might sound plausible, 1215 is the year this landmark document was sealed, making it the correct answer. It's a cornerstone of British legal history.
