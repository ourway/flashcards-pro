Okay, let's talk about the Parliament of Northern Ireland. Understanding its origins requires a bit of historical context. Following the Irish War of Independence and the Government of Ireland Act in 1920, Ireland was divided. This led to the creation of two separate parliaments: one in Dublin for Southern Ireland and one in Belfast for Northern Ireland. While the Dublin parliament didn't really take off due to continued conflict, the Parliament of Northern Ireland did. It was officially established in 1922, marking a significant moment in the political landscape of the island. This parliament was responsible for governing Northern Ireland for several decades, dealing with issues specific to the region. It's easy to get confused with later dates like 1999, when the Northern Ireland Assembly was established as part of the Good Friday Agreement, but that's a completely different body. So, 1922 is the key year to remember for the *first* establishment of a parliament specifically for Northern Ireland.
