The 20th century saw incredible technological leaps, and two British figures stand out for their foundational contributions to the digital age. Alan Turing, though he tragically died young, is considered one of the fathers of computer science. In the 1930s, he developed the concept of the Turing machine, a theoretical device that could perform any calculation. This was a crucial step towards the development of actual computers. Later, during World War II, Turing played a vital role at Bletchley Park, helping to crack the German Enigma code, which significantly shortened the war. Then there's Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web in 1989 while working at CERN. He created the system of hyperlinks, URLs, and HTML that allows us to navigate and share information online. Without Berners-Lee's invention, the internet would be a very different, much less accessible place. The other options listed are important figures, but they primarily contributed to earlier eras. Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Brunel were all pioneers in their respective fields, but their contributions predate the digital revolution of the 20th century.
