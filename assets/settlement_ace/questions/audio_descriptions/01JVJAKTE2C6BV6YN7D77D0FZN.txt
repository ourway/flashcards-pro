Solicitors, like many professionals who provide services, typically charge fees based on the amount of time they dedicate to a case. This is because legal work can vary significantly in complexity and the time it takes to resolve. A simple will might take only a few hours, while a complex property dispute could take months. Charging by time allows the solicitor to accurately reflect the effort involved. While some legal work might be offered at a fixed price, this is usually for very specific, routine tasks. "No Win No Fee" arrangements are also possible, but these are generally reserved for specific types of cases, such as personal injury claims, and even then, the fees are still calculated based on the time spent if the case is successful. So, while other fee structures exist, the most common and fundamental basis for a solicitor's fees is the time they spend working on your case.
