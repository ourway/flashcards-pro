The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 56 independent countries, most of which were formerly part of the British Empire. It's a unique organization where countries cooperate on various issues like trade, development, and democracy. Pakistan's history is deeply intertwined with the British Empire, having been part of British India before gaining independence in 1947. When Pakistan became independent, it initially joined the Commonwealth. There was a period when Pakistan temporarily left the Commonwealth in 1972, but it rejoined in 1989. So, even though there was a break, Pakistan is currently a member. This membership reflects the ongoing historical and cultural ties between Pakistan and the UK, as well as Pakistan's commitment to the Commonwealth's values. It's easy to get confused because of that brief exit, but Pakistan is indeed part of the Commonwealth family.
