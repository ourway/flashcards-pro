Okay, let's talk about TV licenses for older folks. The TV license fee is something everyone in the UK generally has to pay if they watch or record live TV programmes on any channel, or download or watch BBC programmes on iPlayer. It's how the BBC is funded, allowing it to remain free from advertising. Now, for a long time, everyone over 75 was entitled to a free TV license. This was introduced in 2000, as a way to help pensioners on low incomes. However, things changed in August 2020. The BBC, which took over responsibility for funding the concession from the government, said it could no longer afford to provide free licenses to all over-75s. So, the rules changed. Now, only those over 75 who receive Pension Credit are eligible for a free TV license. Pension Credit is a benefit that provides extra money to help with living costs for people over State Pension age and on a low income. So, while it was once universally true that over 75s got a free license, now it's only true for those receiving Pension Credit.
