Maiden Castle is one of the largest and most complex Iron Age hill forts in Europe, and it's a truly impressive sight. These hill forts were essentially fortified settlements, providing protection for communities during times of conflict. Maiden Castle, in particular, has a long history, with evidence of occupation dating back to the Neolithic period, thousands of years before the Iron Age. It reached its peak in terms of size and complexity during the Iron Age, around 600 BC. Now, while there are hill forts scattered across Britain, Maiden Castle is specifically located in Dorset, in the southwest of England. Dorset is known for its beautiful coastline, rolling hills, and rich history, and Maiden Castle is one of its most iconic landmarks. So, when you think of Maiden Castle, picture it nestled in the Dorset landscape â€“ that's its home. The other options listed are also areas with historical significance, but they simply aren't where Maiden Castle is found.
