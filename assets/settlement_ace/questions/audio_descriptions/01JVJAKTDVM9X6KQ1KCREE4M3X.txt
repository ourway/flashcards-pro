The Battle of Trafalgar, fought in 1805, was a pivotal naval engagement during the Napoleonic Wars. It pitted the British Royal Navy against the combined fleets of France and Spain. Now, while figures like the Duke of Wellington were instrumental in land battles against Napoleon, Trafalgar was all about naval power. The British fleet, under the command of Admiral Horatio Nelson, achieved a decisive victory, preventing Napoleon from invading Britain. Nelson's innovative tactics and inspirational leadership were key to this success. Sadly, Nelson himself was fatally wounded during the battle, becoming a national hero. Oliver Cromwell lived much earlier, during the 17th century, and Robert the Bruce was a Scottish king in the 14th century, so neither were involved in the Napoleonic Wars. Therefore, Admiral Nelson is the correct answer because he was the commander who led the British fleet to victory at the Battle of Trafalgar.
