Scotland operates with a devolved government, meaning it has its own parliament and handles many of its own affairs independently from the UK Parliament in London. This system of devolution was formally established following a referendum in 1997 and the subsequent Scotland Act of 1998. The Scottish Parliament, located in Edinburgh, is responsible for making laws on a wide range of issues, including education, healthcare, and the environment, within Scotland. While certain matters like defense and foreign policy remain under the control of the UK Parliament, the Scottish government, based in Edinburgh, is undeniably the primary governing body for Scotland. So, when you think about who's making decisions about Scottish schools or hospitals, it's the government in Edinburgh, not London.
