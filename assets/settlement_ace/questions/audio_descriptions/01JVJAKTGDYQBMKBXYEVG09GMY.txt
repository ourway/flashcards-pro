The UK's national anthem, "God Save the Queen" (or "God Save the King" when there's a male monarch), represents the country and the monarch as head of state, but it's not exclusively reserved for royal appearances. Think of it like a national flag; it symbolizes the nation and can be used in various contexts. The anthem is played at significant national events, sporting occasions, and even in cinemas before films sometimes. It's a way to express national pride and unity. While it's certainly played when the monarch is present, that's not the only time. Believing it's *only* for the Queen's presence is a common misconception because it's so closely associated with the monarchy. However, its use extends far beyond just those specific instances. So, you can hear it played in many settings, not just when the Queen (or King) is around!
