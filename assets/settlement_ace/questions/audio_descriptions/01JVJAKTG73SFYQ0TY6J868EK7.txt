Hadrian's Wall, constructed by the Roman army beginning around 122 AD, was a massive defensive barrier stretching across northern Britain. Think of it as the northern frontier of the Roman Empire. It wasn't just a wall; it was a complex system including forts, milecastles, and turrets, all designed to control movement and defend against raids from the north. Housesteads was one of the largest and best-preserved Roman forts along the wall, housing a significant garrison. Vindolanda, located just south of the wall, was another crucial Roman auxiliary fort, famous for the Vindolanda tablets â€“ incredibly rare wooden writing tablets that give us a fascinating glimpse into daily life in Roman Britain. Skara Brae, on the other hand, is a Neolithic village in Orkney, dating back thousands of years *before* the Romans even arrived in Britain. Sutton Hoo is an Anglo-Saxon burial site from the 7th century AD, centuries *after* Hadrian's Wall was built and the Roman Empire had declined in Britain. So, Housesteads and Vindolanda are the only options directly associated with Hadrian's Wall and Roman military presence in the area.
