Okay, let's break down why "Friends of the Earth" is the charity dedicated to environmental protection. Environmental charities focus on safeguarding our planet, its ecosystems, and natural resources. "Friends of the Earth" is a well-known international environmental advocacy organization. Founded in the US in 1969 and later expanding to the UK and other countries, its core mission is to campaign for environmental protection and sustainability. They work on issues like climate change, deforestation, pollution, and biodiversity loss. Now, let's look at why the other options are incorrect. The NSPCC is the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, focusing on child welfare. Shelter is a charity that campaigns for and supports people struggling with homelessness. Crisis is another charity dedicated to helping homeless people. While these are all very worthy causes, they are primarily focused on social welfare rather than environmental issues. So, when you think about charities dedicated to protecting the environment, "Friends of the Earth" is the one that directly aligns with that goal.
