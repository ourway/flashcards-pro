The Channel Islands, located off the coast of France, have a unique relationship with the UK. They're not part of the United Kingdom itself, but they are Crown Dependencies. This means that the British monarch is the head of state, but the islands have their own elected governments, laws, and courts. This arrangement dates back to the Norman Conquest in 1066 when William the Conqueror, who was Duke of Normandy, became King of England. The Channel Islands were part of the Duchy of Normandy, and this connection has persisted even though mainland Normandy is now part of France. So, while the UK is responsible for their defense and international relations, the Channel Islands maintain a high degree of autonomy. Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, on the other hand, are all constituent parts of the United Kingdom, governed by the UK Parliament in Westminster. The Channel Islands' unique position is a result of a long and fascinating history, setting them apart from the rest of the UK.
