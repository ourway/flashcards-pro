Okay, let's talk about American independence. The key thing to remember is that the American colonies formally declared their independence from Great Britain in 1776. This was a huge moment, marked by the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4th. Think of it as America's birthday! The Revolutionary War then raged for several years. While fighting continued after 1776, the *declaration* itself happened that year. The war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which is when Britain formally recognized American independence. So, while 1783 is important for marking the *end* of the conflict, the declaration of independence, the actual statement that they were breaking away, happened seven years earlier. That's why the statement is false. It's easy to get the dates mixed up, but focusing on the Declaration itself being in 1776 helps to keep it straight.
