Diwali, often called the Festival of Lights, is a significant five-day festival celebrated by Hindus, Sikhs, and Jains around the world. Its timing is linked to the Hindu lunar calendar, usually falling between mid-October and mid-November. The festival symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. Homes, shops, and public places are brightly decorated with oil lamps called diyas, candles, and colourful lights. Fireworks and feasts are also a big part of the celebrations. The lights are central to the festival's meaning, representing the inner light that protects from spiritual darkness. While Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, and Easter Monday are important Christian holidays marking periods of repentance, the crucifixion of Jesus, and his resurrection respectively, they have no connection to Diwali's traditions or its celebration of light.
