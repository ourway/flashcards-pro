Wales, a constituent country of the UK, is known for its rugged coastline, mountainous national parks, distinctive Welsh culture, and of course, its own language. Snowdonia is a mountainous region in northwestern Wales and a national park, dominated by Mount Snowdon, the highest peak in Wales. The name "Snowdonia" itself is derived from "Snowdon," reflecting the area's mountainous terrain. So, when you're asked about a UK landmark located in Wales, Snowdonia immediately stands out because it's geographically situated within Wales and is a significant natural landmark. The other options are located elsewhere: Loch Lomond is in Scotland, famous for its beautiful loch; The Giant's Causeway is in Northern Ireland, known for its unique rock formations; and The Lake District is in England, known for its lakes and mountains.
