Wales has a really interesting history of resisting outside rule. After the Roman Empire withdrew from Britain in the 5th century, the Anglo-Saxons began migrating and establishing kingdoms in what is now England. However, the mountainous terrain of Wales provided a natural barrier, and the Welsh people, descendants of the ancient Britons, fiercely defended their territory. They maintained their own distinct culture, language, and political structures, largely independent from the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to the east. While there were certainly periods of conflict and border skirmishes, Wales was never fully conquered or integrated into Anglo-Saxon England. Think of figures like King Arthur, a legendary British leader who, according to some accounts, fought against the Anglo-Saxon invaders. So, while Anglo-Saxon influence certainly existed, the Welsh fiercely maintained their independence and were never under Anglo-Saxon rule.
