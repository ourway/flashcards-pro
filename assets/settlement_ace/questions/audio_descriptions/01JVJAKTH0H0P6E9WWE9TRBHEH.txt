Okay, let's talk about the Church of England. Back in the 16th century, England was a Catholic country, and the head of the Catholic Church was the Pope in Rome. King Henry VIII wanted to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, because she hadn't produced a male heir. He needed a son to secure the Tudor dynasty! However, the Pope wouldn't grant him an annulment. Henry, being a powerful king, decided to take matters into his own hands. In 1534, he passed the Act of Supremacy, declaring himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England. This essentially broke England away from the Roman Catholic Church, establishing a new, independent church with the monarch at its head. So, while the Pope was a major religious figure at the time, he certainly didn't establish the Church of England; Henry VIII did it to get a divorce! Henry VII was his father, and St. George is the Patron Saint of England, but neither of them had anything to do with the creation of the Church of England.
