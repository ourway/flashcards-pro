Okay, let's talk about Sutton Hoo. This is a really important archaeological site in England, and it gives us incredible insight into the early Anglo-Saxon period. Think around the early 7th century, so we're talking about the time after the Romans left and before England was really unified. What makes Sutton Hoo so special is the discovery of an undisturbed ship burial. Inside, archaeologists found amazing treasures: gold jewellery, silverware, weapons, and other artifacts that suggest the person buried there was someone of very high status, possibly even a king. Now, all of this history is rooted in a specific location. Sutton Hoo is actually the name of the area where these burial mounds were found, and that area is in Suffolk. So, if you're thinking about where this incredible Anglo-Saxon treasure was unearthed, remember the name Sutton Hoo and link it to the county of Suffolk. While Norfolk, Essex and Sussex are all English counties, they are not the location of the Sutton Hoo ship burial.
