The Battle of Worcester, fought on 3 September 1651, was the final battle of the English Civil War. Charles II, son of the executed Charles I, attempted to reclaim the throne but was decisively defeated by Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army. Following this defeat, Charles II was on the run, desperately trying to escape to mainland Europe. During his escape, he famously hid in an oak tree at Boscobel House in Shropshire to avoid capture by Parliamentarian soldiers. This oak tree became known as the Royal Oak, a symbol of Charles's escape and the restoration of the monarchy. While Bosworth Field is famous for the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, marking the end of the Wars of the Roses, and Dunbar was the site of a Scottish victory in 1650, neither are associated with Charles II's escape. Hastings, of course, is linked to the Norman invasion of 1066, centuries before Charles II. Therefore, Worcester is the correct answer because it was after this battle that Charles II needed to evade capture and famously used the oak tree as refuge.
