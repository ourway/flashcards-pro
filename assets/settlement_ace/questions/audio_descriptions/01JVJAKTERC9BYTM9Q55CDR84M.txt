St. Andrew's Day, celebrated on November 30th, is Scotland's official national day. St. Andrew is the patron saint of Scotland, and his connection to the country dates back centuries. Legend has it that some of his relics were brought to Scotland in the 4th century. While the exact details are shrouded in history, St. Andrew became a symbol of Scottish identity. The Saltire, Scotland's flag featuring a white diagonal cross on a blue background, is said to represent the cross on which St. Andrew was crucified. Celebrations on St. Andrew's Day often involve traditional Scottish food, music, dancing, and ceilidhs. It's a day to celebrate Scottish culture and heritage. So, while the other dates in November might seem plausible, November 30th is the specific day dedicated to honouring Scotland's patron saint and celebrating Scottish identity.
