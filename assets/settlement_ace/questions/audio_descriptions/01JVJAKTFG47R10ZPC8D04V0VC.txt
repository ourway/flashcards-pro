The Commonwealth is all about cooperation and shared values, not obligation. Think of it like a club â€“ countries choose to join and can leave whenever they want. This stems from its historical roots. The Commonwealth evolved from the British Empire, but as former colonies gained independence, they weren't forced to stay connected to Britain. Instead, the Commonwealth was reimagined as a voluntary association of equal and independent nations. This transformation was formalized in the 1926 Balfour Declaration and the 1931 Statute of Westminster, which recognized the Dominions (Canada, Australia, South Africa, etc.) as autonomous communities. So, while there are benefits to membership, like trade opportunities and cultural exchange, no country is compelled to join or remain a member. A country can leave, like Zimbabwe did in 2003, and rejoin later, as it did in 2018, highlighting the voluntary nature of the organization.
