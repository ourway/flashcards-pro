London's history as the capital of England stretches back over a thousand years, solidifying its position as the nation's political, economic, and cultural heart. While England is part of the United Kingdom, and the UK has its own government, London predates the formation of the UK by centuries. It became the capital of the Kingdom of England way back in the 11th century, around the time of the Norman Conquest. Over time, key institutions like Parliament, the Royal Family, and major financial centres all concentrated in London. Now, when we talk about the capital of England, we're referring to the city where the English government is based, where major English cultural institutions are located, and which has historically been the centre of power. Belfast is the capital of Northern Ireland, Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland, and Cardiff is the capital of Wales, but none of these are the capital of England.
