Hanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, is a Jewish festival commemorating the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem during the second century BCE. The story goes that when the Maccabees, a Jewish rebel army, reclaimed the Temple from the Seleucid Empire, they found only enough consecrated oil to light the Temple's menorah for one day. Miraculously, the oil burned for eight days. This miracle is central to the Hanukkah celebration. Because of this, the festival is observed for eight nights and days, starting on the 25th day of Kislev in the Hebrew calendar, which usually falls in December. Each night, one additional candle is lit on the menorah until all eight candles are lit on the final night. So, the duration of Hanukkah directly commemorates the eight-day miracle of the oil.
