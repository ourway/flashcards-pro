Okay, let's clear up some royal history! It's easy to get Queen Elizabeth I mixed up with other monarchs, especially when religion is involved. The key thing to remember is that Elizabeth I, who reigned from 1558 to 1603, actually established the Church of England as the dominant religion. Her father, Henry VIII, had broken away from the Catholic Church to get a divorce, and while there were religious shifts during the reigns of Edward VI and Mary I, Elizabeth firmly cemented England's Protestant identity. Now, Mary I, Elizabeth's half-sister, was a devout Catholic. She earned the nickname "Bloody Mary" because she brutally persecuted Protestants during her reign (1553-1558), burning hundreds at the stake. So, the statement about Elizabeth I being a devout Catholic who persecuted Protestants is false. It's Mary I whose reign was marked by Catholic zeal and the suppression of Protestants. A common misconception is confusing the two queens due to their similar names and the religious turmoil of the era, but their religious stances were actually quite opposite!
