The Wars of the Roses, a tumultuous period in English history, were essentially a power struggle for the English throne during the 15th century. Think of it as a massive family feud, but with crowns and armies involved! The two main families vying for control were the House of Lancaster and the House of York. Each house had a symbolic rose associated with it: Lancaster with the red rose, and York with the white rose â€“ hence the name "Wars of the Roses." This wasn't just about territory; it was about who had the rightful claim to be king. The conflict spanned several decades, involving battles, betrayals, and shifting allegiances. While the Tudor dynasty did emerge from this period, they came to power *after* the Wars of the Roses by uniting the two houses through marriage. The House of Windsor is a much later royal house, only taking that name in the 20th century. So, the core conflict was between those two rose-bearing houses, Lancaster and York.
