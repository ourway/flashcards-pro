Okay, let's talk about the origins of the Church of England and why St. Augustine is the correct answer. Before Augustine arrived in 597 AD, Christianity existed in Britain, but it wasn't centrally organized. Pope Gregory the Great sent Augustine to convert the Anglo-Saxons, who were largely pagan at the time. Augustine landed in Kent, which was ruled by King Ethelbert, whose wife Bertha was already a Christian. Ethelbert allowed Augustine to preach, and he was very successful, converting the King and many of his subjects. Augustine established his headquarters in Canterbury, which became the most important religious center in England. He founded a monastery there and became the first Archbishop of Canterbury, laying the foundation for the structure of the Church of England as we know it. While St. Patrick is famous for his missionary work in Ireland and St. Columba spread Christianity in Scotland, neither of them were involved in establishing the primary religious seat in England. St. George is the patron saint of England, but he lived much earlier and wasn't an Archbishop.
