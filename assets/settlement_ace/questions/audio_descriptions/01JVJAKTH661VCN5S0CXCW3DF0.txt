Bank Holidays are a key part of the UK's calendar, providing welcome breaks throughout the year. They were originally established by the Bank Holidays Act of 1871, introduced by Sir John Lubbock, a banker and politician. The intention was to give bank employees time off, but the holidays quickly became observed by the wider public. The specific timing of the May and August Bank Holidays is designed to space out these breaks and avoid long stretches without a public holiday. The early May Bank Holiday is always the first Monday of May, and the late May/early June Bank Holiday falls on the last Monday of May. The August Bank Holiday is always the last Monday in August. This scheduling creates long weekends that are popular for travel, outdoor activities, and spending time with family and friends. So, it's true that Bank Holidays are typically scheduled at the beginning of May, late May/early June, and in August.
