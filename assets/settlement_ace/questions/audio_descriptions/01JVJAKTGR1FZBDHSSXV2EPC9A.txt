John Constable was indeed a real person, and a very important one in British art history! He lived from 1776 to 1837 and is famous for his incredibly beautiful landscape paintings, particularly those depicting the English countryside, especially Suffolk. Think of iconic images like "The Hay Wain" â€“ that's Constable's work. Now, the idea that he founded the modern police force is where the question becomes false. The creation of the modern police force is attributed to Sir Robert Peel, who established the Metropolitan Police Service in London in 1829. These officers were even nicknamed "bobbies" or "peelers" after him! So, while Constable was busy capturing the beauty of the natural world on canvas, Peel was laying the groundwork for modern law enforcement. It's easy to get historical figures mixed up, but remembering Constable as the landscape artist and Peel as the father of modern policing should help you avoid this kind of trick question.
