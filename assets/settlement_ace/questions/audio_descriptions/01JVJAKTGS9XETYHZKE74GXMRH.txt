Okay, let's talk about women in the UK workforce. For a long time, women's participation in the workforce was significantly lower than men's, largely due to societal expectations and limited opportunities. However, over the 20th and 21st centuries, things have changed dramatically. The Equal Pay Act of 1970 was a landmark piece of legislation that aimed to eliminate pay discrimination between men and women. Combined with increased access to education and changing social attitudes, women's participation in the workforce has steadily grown. Now, women make up roughly half of the UK's workforce. While it's not exactly 50% – it fluctuates slightly – it's the closest and most accurate approximation. The other options, like 30% or 40%, are far too low and don't reflect the current reality of women's significant contribution to the UK economy. And while some sectors might have a higher percentage of women, 60% is too high when considering the entire UK workforce. So, remembering that women's participation has increased dramatically over the years helps you recall that they now make up approximately half of the workforce.
