The late 17th century was a turbulent time in British history, marked by religious and political tensions. King James II, a Catholic, faced increasing opposition from Parliament, who were largely Protestant and feared a Catholic dynasty. They invited William of Orange, the Protestant ruler of the Netherlands and husband of James II's daughter Mary, to take the English throne. In 1688, William landed in England with an army. James II's support crumbled, and he fled to France. This transfer of power is known as the 'Glorious Revolution' because it was achieved with very little bloodshed in England. It marked a significant shift in power from the monarchy to Parliament, establishing constitutional monarchy principles. The other options refer to different periods: The Restoration was when the monarchy was brought back after the English Civil War, the Great Depression was a global economic crisis in the 1930s, and the Blitz was the intense bombing of Britain during World War II.
