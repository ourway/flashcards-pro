Radar, which stands for Radio Detection and Ranging, is a crucial technology used for detecting objects at a distance, whether it's ships at sea or airplanes in the sky. Its invention wasn't the work of a single moment, but rather the culmination of scientific advancements over time. However, Sir Robert Watson-Watt is widely credited with its practical development and implementation. In the 1930s, as the threat of war loomed, Britain needed a way to detect incoming enemy aircraft. Watson-Watt, a Scottish physicist, built on earlier experiments with radio waves and developed a system that could bounce radio signals off aircraft, allowing their location and speed to be determined. This early radar system, deployed along the British coast, proved vital during the Battle of Britain in 1940, giving the Royal Air Force crucial early warning of German air raids. While others contributed to the underlying science, Watson-Watt led the team that turned the theory into a working, life-saving technology, making him the key figure associated with the invention of radar. The other names listed are notable individuals, but they are known for achievements in different fields: Patrick Steptoe was a pioneer in in-vitro fertilization, James Goodfellow invented the ATM, and Mary Peters is a celebrated athlete.
