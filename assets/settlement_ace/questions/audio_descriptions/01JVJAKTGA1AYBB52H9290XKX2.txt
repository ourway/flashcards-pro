Okay, let's break down how the legal system works in Northern Ireland regarding minor criminal cases. The UK actually has three separate legal systems: one for England and Wales, one for Scotland, and one for Northern Ireland. Each has its own court structure and procedures. In Northern Ireland, the court system is structured to handle different levels of crime. Minor criminal cases, things like petty theft, traffic offenses, or minor public order offenses, need to be dealt with efficiently. That's where District Judges and Deputy District Judges come in. They preside over these lower courts, similar to magistrates in England and Wales. So, the statement is true because Deputy District Judges are specifically tasked with handling these smaller criminal matters in Northern Ireland's legal framework. It's a key part of how the justice system ensures that less serious crimes are addressed promptly without overwhelming the higher courts.
