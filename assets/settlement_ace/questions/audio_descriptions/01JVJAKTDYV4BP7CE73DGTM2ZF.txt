The abolition of slavery in the British Empire was a gradual process, building on earlier efforts to limit the slave trade. While the slave trade itself was outlawed in 1807, owning slaves remained legal. The movement to fully abolish slavery gained momentum in the early 19th century, driven by abolitionist campaigners and changing public opinion. The Emancipation Act of 1833 finally made the purchase or ownership of slaves illegal throughout the British Empire. It came into effect on 1 August 1834. Although the Act freed enslaved people, it also included a controversial provision for compensation to slave owners for the loss of their "property." This compensation highlights the complex and often contradictory attitudes towards slavery at the time. So, 1833 is the year to remember because that is when the Emancipation Act was enacted.
