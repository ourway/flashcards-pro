The House of Lords, while part of the UK Parliament, doesn't simply rubber-stamp the government's plans. It's designed to act as a check and balance on the House of Commons, which is where the government usually has its majority. The Lords is made up of life peers, appointed for their expertise, and hereditary peers. They bring a wealth of experience from various fields, allowing them to scrutinize legislation in detail. They can propose amendments to bills passed by the Commons, and while the Commons can ultimately override the Lords, it's a process that requires careful consideration. The Lords often focuses on refining laws, pointing out potential flaws or unintended consequences that might have been missed. So, while the government certainly influences the legislative agenda, the House of Lords plays an independent role in shaping the final laws of the UK. Thinking that the Lords just follows the government is a common mistake because the government proposes the laws, but the Lords are there to improve them.
