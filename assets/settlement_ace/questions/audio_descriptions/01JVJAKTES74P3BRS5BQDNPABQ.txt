The phrase "Dunkirk spirit" is deeply rooted in the events of World War II. In May and June 1940, the British Expeditionary Force, along with French and other Allied troops, were trapped by the advancing German army on the beaches of Dunkirk in France. Facing imminent capture or death, a massive rescue operation, codenamed Operation Dynamo, was launched. What made this evacuation so remarkable was the involvement of hundreds of civilian boats – fishing boats, pleasure cruisers, and other small vessels – alongside naval ships. These brave civilians sailed across the English Channel to help rescue the stranded soldiers. The "Dunkirk spirit" thus refers to this extraordinary act of courage, resilience, and community effort during the evacuation of Allied soldiers from France. It symbolizes a time when people came together in the face of adversity, demonstrating a determination to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. It's not about the Blitz (the bombing of British cities), social changes after the Black Death, or Huguenot refugees; it's specifically tied to this pivotal moment in WWII.
