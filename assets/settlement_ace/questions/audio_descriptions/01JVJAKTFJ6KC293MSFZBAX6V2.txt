Snowdon, or Yr Wyddfa in Welsh, is the highest mountain in Wales, standing at 1,085 metres. It's a real symbol of Welsh identity and pride. The name "Snowdon" is thought to come from the Old English for "snow hill," which makes sense given its height! But its Welsh name, Yr Wyddfa, translates to "the tumulus" or "the grave," linking it to ancient legends. Snowdonia National Park, where Snowdon is located, is a protected area known for its stunning landscapes and rich history. So, while Scotland has Ben Nevis, England has Scafell Pike, and Northern Ireland has Slieve Donard, Snowdon is definitively in Wales. Thinking of Welsh dragons and the country's distinct culture should help you remember that this iconic mountain belongs to Wales.
