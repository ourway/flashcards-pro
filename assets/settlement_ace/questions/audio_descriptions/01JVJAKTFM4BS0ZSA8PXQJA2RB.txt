Hadrian's Wall stands as a powerful reminder of Roman Britain, built nearly 2,000 years ago in the 2nd century AD on the orders of Emperor Hadrian. Its purpose was to mark the northern boundary of the Roman Empire and to control movement in and out of the province of Britannia. Think of it as a physical manifestation of Roman power and organization. Now, UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, designates sites around the world that are considered to have outstanding universal value to humanity. These sites are protected so that future generations can appreciate them. Given Hadrian's Wall's incredible historical significance, its remarkable preservation, and its representation of Roman civilization, it was indeed designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. This recognition underscores its importance not just to Britain, but to the world's shared history. So, the statement is true.
