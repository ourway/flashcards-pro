The Paralympics are an international sporting event for athletes with disabilities, running parallel to the Olympic Games. They showcase incredible talent and determination. Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson is one of Britain's most successful Paralympians. She competed in wheelchair racing and has won 11 gold, 4 silver, and 1 bronze medals across several Paralympic Games. She's also a prominent advocate for disability rights. Ellie Simmonds is another celebrated British Paralympian, known for her achievements in swimming. She has won multiple gold medals, starting from a young age, and has been a significant figure in raising the profile of Paralympic sports in the UK. While Dame Kelly Holmes is a celebrated Olympic athlete, known for her gold medals in running at the Athens Olympics, and Jayne Torvill is a famous Olympic ice skater, they are not Paralympians. Therefore, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson and Ellie Simmonds are the correct answer because they are both highly decorated and well-known British athletes who have competed in the Paralympic Games.
