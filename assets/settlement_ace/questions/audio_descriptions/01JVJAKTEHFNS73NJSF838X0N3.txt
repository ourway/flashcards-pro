The United Kingdom operates under a system where the people elect Members of Parliament (MPs) to represent them in the House of Commons. This is the core of a parliamentary system. The political party that wins a majority of these seats usually forms the government, and their leader becomes the Prime Minister. It's a democracy because citizens have the right to vote and choose their representatives. The "democracy" part means that ultimate power resides with the people, who exercise it through their elected officials. The "parliamentary" part specifies that the elected parliament is the central institution of government. While some decisions are devolved to other regions, the UK isn't a federal system like the United States or Germany, where power is constitutionally divided between a central government and regional governments. The UK certainly isn't a communist state or a dictatorship, as these systems lack the fundamental democratic principles of free and fair elections, political pluralism, and protection of individual rights that are central to the UK's governance.
