The English Civil War, a pivotal period in British history during the 17th century, was essentially a power struggle between King Charles I and Parliament. The conflict wasn't just about who ruled, but also about religious differences and the rights of the people. Now, the two main sides in this war were known by nicknames that reflected their appearance and allegiances. The supporters of King Charles I were called Cavaliers. This name came from the French word for horseman, and it implied a certain aristocratic flair and loyalty to the monarchy. On the other side, the Parliamentarians were known as Roundheads. This name referred to their closely cropped hair, a stark contrast to the long, flowing locks fashionable among the Cavaliers. The Roundheads were largely Puritan and represented a growing middle class who wanted more say in how the country was governed. So, Cavaliers and Roundheads are the terms that specifically identify the two opposing factions in this significant conflict.
