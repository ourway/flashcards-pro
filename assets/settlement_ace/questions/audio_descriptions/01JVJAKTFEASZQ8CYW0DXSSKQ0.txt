The UK has a long history of religious diversity and tolerance, even though the Church of England is the official state church. Freedom of religion is a fundamental principle protected by law. Historically, various Acts of Toleration, starting in the late 17th century, gradually granted religious freedoms to nonconformists â€“ those who didn't adhere to the Church of England. Today, the Human Rights Act of 1998, incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights, guarantees freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. This means people in the UK can practice any religion they choose, or none at all, without fear of government interference or persecution. While the monarch is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, this doesn't translate to mandatory adherence for citizens. The idea that the state dictates religious belief is simply untrue in the modern United Kingdom.
