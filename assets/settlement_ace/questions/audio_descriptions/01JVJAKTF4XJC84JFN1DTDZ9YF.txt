The Union Flag, often called the Union Jack, is a powerful symbol representing the United Kingdom, and its design is all about history and unity. It's actually a combination of three different crosses, each representing a different patron saint and kingdom. First, there's the red cross of St. George, the patron saint of England. Then, there's the white saltire, which is a diagonal cross, representing St. Andrew, the patron saint of Scotland. Finally, there's the red saltire, representing St. Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland. The flag was created over time, starting with the union of England and Scotland in 1603 under King James I (also James VI of Scotland), and the Irish cross was added later in 1801 when Great Britain and Ireland united. So, while it might look complex, it's only made up of those three crosses layered together. Saying it has four crosses is incorrect because there isn't a fourth distinct cross incorporated into the design.
