Cambridge University, established in the early 13th century, has a long and storied history of academic excellence, particularly in the sciences. Think of it as one of the oldest and most respected universities in the English-speaking world! Isaac Newton, one of the most influential scientists of all time, attended Cambridge's Trinity College. He arrived there in 1661 and spent much of his academic life at Cambridge, developing his groundbreaking theories on gravity, motion, and calculus. While Oxford is another very old and prestigious university, and Warwick and London State University are modern institutions, Newton's legacy is firmly linked to Cambridge. It's even said that the famous apple tree incident, which inspired his theory of gravity, happened in the orchard at his family home near Cambridge. So, when you think of Newton, think of Cambridge!
