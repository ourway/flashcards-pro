The Battle of Agincourt stands out because it occurred way before Napoleon Bonaparte even lived! Agincourt was a pivotal battle during the Hundred Years' War, fought in 1415 between England and France. Think medieval knights, longbows, and muddy fields â€“ a very different era from Napoleon's time. On the other hand, the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 was a crucial naval victory for the British against Napoleon's forces, securing British dominance at sea. Then there's the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, where Napoleon was finally defeated, marking the end of his reign. So, while Trafalgar and Waterloo are directly linked to Napoleon's military campaigns in the early 19th century, Agincourt is firmly rooted in the 15th century, making it the battle that wasn't fought against him. It's easy to get confused with all the battles in British history, but remembering Agincourt's connection to the Hundred Years' War helps place it in a completely different historical period.
