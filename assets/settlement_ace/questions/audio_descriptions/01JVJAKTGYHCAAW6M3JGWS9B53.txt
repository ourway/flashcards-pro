During Charles II's reign in the 17th century, London experienced a period of significant rebuilding and change after the turbulent years of the English Civil War and the Commonwealth. However, one event overshadows much of this era: the Great Fire of London in 1666. This devastating fire started in a baker's shop on Pudding Lane and raged for several days, consuming much of the city. Wooden buildings, narrow streets, and a lack of effective firefighting methods allowed the fire to spread rapidly. While the other options – flood, earthquake, and war – represent potential disasters, none of them occurred in London during Charles II's reign with the same scale and impact as the Great Fire. The fire led to the destruction of many important buildings, including St. Paul's Cathedral, but it also paved the way for a new, more modern London to emerge, designed in part by Sir Christopher Wren.
