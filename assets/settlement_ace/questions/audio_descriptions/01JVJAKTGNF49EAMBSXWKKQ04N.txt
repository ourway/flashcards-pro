Okay, so the idea here is that you *are* responsible for cleaning up after your pet in public places. Think about it this way: public spaces are shared by everyone, and keeping them clean and safe is a collective responsibility. In the UK, local councils have bylaws that specifically address dog fouling, and these laws are in place to maintain hygiene and prevent the spread of diseases. Dog waste can carry harmful bacteria and parasites, posing a health risk, especially to children. Ignoring this rule can lead to on-the-spot fines, sometimes called "fixed penalty notices," issued by local authorities. So, the statement that you are *not* responsible is definitely false, making "True" the correct answer. It's all about being a responsible member of the community and respecting shared spaces.
