Okay, let's talk about the origins of the Prime Minister role in the UK. While the office of Prime Minister wasn't formally established with that title in the early 18th century, Sir Robert Walpole is widely regarded as the first person to effectively act as one. He was the First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Leader of the House of Commons from 1721 to 1742. Crucially, he developed a close working relationship with King George I, who spoke little English and relied heavily on Walpole to manage government. Walpole skillfully controlled Parliament through patronage and political management, becoming the leading minister in the government. Although he never officially held the title "Prime Minister," his power and influence were so significant that he was often referred to as such by his contemporaries, sometimes derisively. The other options are incorrect because they all came much later. Edward Heath was a Prime Minister in the 20th century, William Lamb (Lord Melbourne) in the 19th, and Arthur Wellesley (Duke of Wellington) also in the 19th. So, while the title wasn't official, Walpole's role and recognition make him the first person we consider the Prime Minister.
