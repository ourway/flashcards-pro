The UK has a long history of evolving religious freedom, culminating in a society where individuals are legally protected in their right to choose, or not choose, a religion. This freedom is a cornerstone of British values and is underpinned by various pieces of legislation, including the Human Rights Act 1998, which incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law. Article 9 of the Convention specifically protects freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. Historically, while the Church of England holds a special position, religious tolerance has gradually expanded over centuries. The idea that individuals should be free to follow their own beliefs, or to have no religious beliefs at all, is a fundamental principle of modern British society. So, the statement that everyone in the UK has the legal right to choose their religion, or choose not to practice one, is indeed correct.
