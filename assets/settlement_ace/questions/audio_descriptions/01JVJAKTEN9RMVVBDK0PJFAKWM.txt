St. Patrick's Day is the celebrated national day in Northern Ireland, and it's deeply rooted in Irish culture and history. Saint Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland, credited with bringing Christianity to the island in the 5th century. The holiday, observed on March 17th, commemorates his death and celebrates Irish heritage. Because Northern Ireland shares the island of Ireland, St. Patrick's Day is widely celebrated there, often with parades, traditional music, dancing, and wearing green. While St. George's Day is associated with England, St. Andrew's Day with Scotland, and St. David's Day with Wales, St. Patrick's Day specifically represents Irish identity and is therefore the correct answer for a national day celebrated in Northern Ireland. It's a day when people of all backgrounds in Northern Ireland often come together to enjoy the festivities and celebrate Irish culture.
