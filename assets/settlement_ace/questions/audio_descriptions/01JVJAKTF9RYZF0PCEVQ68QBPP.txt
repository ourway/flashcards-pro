Mary, Queen of Scots, is one of the most fascinating figures in British history, and her religious affiliation was a major factor in the events of her life. Scotland during the 16th century was undergoing the Reformation, a period of religious upheaval where Protestantism was challenging the authority of the Catholic Church. While Scotland eventually became predominantly Protestant, Mary remained a devout Catholic throughout her life. This is crucial because her Catholicism made her a target for suspicion in both Scotland and England, especially as she had a claim to the English throne. Many English Protestants feared a Catholic monarch. So, while it might be tempting to think that as Queen of Scotland she would be Protestant, her unwavering Catholic faith is a well-documented historical fact and a key part of understanding her story. This ultimately led to her execution after being implicated in plots against Queen Elizabeth I.
