Alright, let's talk about the Roman occupation of Britain. The Romans were a major force in shaping the island, but their rule wasn't forever. They first invaded Britain in 55 BC under Julius Caesar, but this was more of a reconnaissance mission than a full-scale takeover. The real Roman conquest began nearly a century later, in 43 AD, under Emperor Claudius. From that point on, they established settlements, built roads, and introduced Roman law and culture. Think of Hadrian's Wall, a massive defensive structure built to mark the northern boundary of Roman Britain. However, by the early 5th century, the Roman Empire was facing increasing pressure from barbarian invasions on the continent. Roman legions were gradually withdrawn from Britain to defend other parts of the empire. The final departure of Roman troops occurred around 410 AD. So, if you do the math, from 43 AD to 410 AD, that's a period of roughly 370 years. Therefore, the statement that the Romans remained in Britain for 300 years is false, as they were here for closer to 400 years.
