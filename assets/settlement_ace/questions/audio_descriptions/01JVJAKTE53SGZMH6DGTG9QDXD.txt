Okay, so when an MP leaves their position mid-term, whether it's because they've sadly passed away or decided to resign, the seat they held in Parliament can't just stay empty. The people in that constituency still need to be represented. Unlike some other countries, the UK doesn't allow the political party to simply appoint a replacement. Instead, a special election, called a by-election, is triggered. Think of it as a mini-election just for that specific area. All the political parties, and sometimes independent candidates, put forward someone to stand, and the people living in that constituency get to vote for their new MP. This ensures that the constituents have a say in who represents them, even outside of the regular general election cycle, and keeps the democratic process going. It's a key part of how the UK ensures continuous representation in Parliament.
