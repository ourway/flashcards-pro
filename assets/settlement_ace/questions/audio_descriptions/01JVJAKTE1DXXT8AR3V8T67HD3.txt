Life expectancy in the UK has dramatically increased over the last century, and it's not down to luck or better weather! The primary drivers are improvements in living standards and healthcare. Think about it: access to nutritious food, clean water, and safe housing are fundamental. As these improved, people became less susceptible to diseases and illnesses that previously shortened lives. Simultaneously, advancements in medical science, the establishment of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948 providing free healthcare at the point of use, and public health initiatives like vaccinations have played a crucial role in treating and preventing diseases. While outdoor activities are beneficial and can contribute to a healthy lifestyle, they aren't the main reason for the overall increase in life expectancy across the population. Similarly, unemployment benefits, while important for social welfare, don't directly impact the nation's lifespan.
