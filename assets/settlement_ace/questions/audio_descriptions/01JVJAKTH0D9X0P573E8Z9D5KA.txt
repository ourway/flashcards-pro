Okay, let's break down the relationship between church and state in the UK, specifically focusing on Northern Ireland and Wales. Historically, England has the Church of England, which is the established state church, meaning it has a formal connection to the government. Scotland, however, has the Church of Scotland, which is the national church, but it's not a state church in the same way as the Church of England. It governs its own affairs. Now, when we look at Northern Ireland and Wales, neither has its own established church. The Church in Wales was actually part of the Church of England until it was disestablished in 1920, meaning it became independent. Northern Ireland, being part of the UK, doesn't have a specific state church either. So, the idea of a separation of church and state applies to both Northern Ireland and Wales in that they don't have a church formally linked to their governments like England does. It's a common misconception to assume that every part of the UK has its own state church, but that's not the case.
