Let's talk about the fight against slavery in Britain. The transatlantic slave trade was a dark period in British history, but it also spurred a powerful abolitionist movement. William Wilberforce was a key figure in this movement. He was a Member of Parliament who tirelessly campaigned for decades to end the slave trade. His efforts finally paid off in 1807 when the Slave Trade Act was passed, making it illegal to trade slaves in the British Empire. However, this didn't end slavery itself. Wilberforce continued his fight, and slavery was eventually abolished throughout the British Empire in 1833, shortly before his death. Now, the Quakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, were pioneers in the anti-slavery movement. They believed that all people are equal in the eyes of God, and they were among the first to condemn slavery on moral and religious grounds. They established some of the earliest anti-slavery groups, advocating for its abolition long before it became a mainstream cause. So, that's why the correct answer highlights Wilberforce's leadership and the Quakers' early activism. While slavery did persist for a time after the initial bans, it certainly didn't last into the 20th century, and the Royal Navy played a crucial role in suppressing the slave trade after it was outlawed, actively intercepting ships carrying slaves.
