Okay, let's unravel the story behind the Tudor rose. The key here is understanding the Wars of the Roses, a series of English civil wars fought in the 15th century between the House of Lancaster, symbolized by a red rose, and the House of York, symbolized by a white rose. Think of it like a medieval family feud, but with armies and thrones at stake! The conflict was incredibly bloody and destabilized England for decades.

Now, the Tudor dynasty emerged from this chaos. Henry Tudor, who became Henry VII, defeated Richard III of York at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. To unite the warring factions and solidify his claim to the throne, Henry married Elizabeth of York. This union was symbolically represented by combining the red rose of Lancaster and the white rose of York into a single emblem: the red and white Tudor rose. It wasn't just a pretty flower; it was a powerful symbol of peace, unity, and the beginning of a new era in English history. So, while a red or white rose alone represents one side of the conflict, the red and white rose together specifically signifies the House of Tudor and their efforts to bring England together.
