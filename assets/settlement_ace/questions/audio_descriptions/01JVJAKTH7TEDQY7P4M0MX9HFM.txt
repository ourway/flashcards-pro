The fight for women's suffrage in the UK was a long and arduous one, spanning decades. Before the 20th century, women were largely excluded from the political process. Groups like the Suffragettes, led by Emmeline Pankhurst, used increasingly radical tactics to demand the right to vote. World War I proved to be a turning point. Women stepped into roles traditionally held by men, contributing significantly to the war effort in factories, hospitals, and other vital sectors. This demonstrated their capabilities and challenged existing societal norms. In 1918, Parliament passed the Representation of the People Act, granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who met certain property qualifications. While this wasn't universal suffrage, it was a monumental step forward, enfranchising around 8.4 million women. It wasn't until 1928 that women achieved equal voting rights with men, with the voting age lowered to 21 for everyone. So, while the fight continued beyond 1918, that year marks the initial breakthrough when women were first awarded the right to cast their votes in the UK.
