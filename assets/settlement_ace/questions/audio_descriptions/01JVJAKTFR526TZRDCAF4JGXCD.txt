Common law, at its heart, is about building legal principles over time through court decisions. Think of it like a snowball rolling down a hill, gathering more snow and getting bigger as it goes. In the British legal system, this means that when a court makes a ruling on a particular case, that ruling becomes a precedent. Other courts, especially lower courts, are expected to follow that precedent when faced with similar cases in the future. This creates a consistent and predictable legal framework. So, the term 'common law' suggests 'following previous decisions' because it's a system where past rulings shape future judgments. It's different from codified law, which is written down in comprehensive legal codes. While juries do decide on verdicts, they don't define common law. The judges interpret and apply the law, building upon the existing body of precedents.
