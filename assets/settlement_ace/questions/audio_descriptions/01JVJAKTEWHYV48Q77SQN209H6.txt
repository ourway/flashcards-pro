Bonfire Night, also known as Guy Fawkes Night, is celebrated on November 5th because it commemorates the failure of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605. This plot was a conspiracy by a group of English Catholics, including Guy Fawkes, to assassinate King James I and blow up the Houses of Parliament. The plot was discovered on November 5th, 1605, when Guy Fawkes was found guarding explosives in the cellars beneath Parliament. Ever since, the 5th of November has been a day of celebration, initially marking the survival of the King and the Protestant establishment. Over time, it evolved into a more general celebration with bonfires, fireworks, and the burning of effigies, often representing Guy Fawkes himself. While Halloween on October 31st involves costumes and trick-or-treating, and other dates in late October or November might have other cultural significance, only November 5th is specifically tied to the historical event of the Gunpowder Plot and the tradition of Bonfire Night.
