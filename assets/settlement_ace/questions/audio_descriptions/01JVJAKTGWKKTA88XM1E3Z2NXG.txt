Okay, let's talk about women's suffrage in the UK. The fight for women to have the right to vote was a long and hard-fought battle spanning decades. It wasn't a single event but a gradual process. The first significant step came in 1918, after World War I, when women over the age of 30 who met certain property qualifications were granted the right to vote. This was partly in recognition of the vital roles women played during the war effort. However, this wasn't full equality. It wasn't until ten years later, in 1928, that the Representation of the People Act was passed, granting all women over the age of 21 the right to vote on equal terms with men. So, 1928 is the key year because it marks the moment when the UK finally achieved voting equality between men and women. It's easy to remember if you think of the "Roaring Twenties" and the social changes happening at that time. The other years are incorrect because they either predate the initial partial enfranchisement or come after the landmark achievement of full equality.
