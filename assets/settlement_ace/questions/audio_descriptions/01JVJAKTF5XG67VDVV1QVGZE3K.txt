Agriculture arrived in Britain relatively late compared to other parts of the world. The last Ice Age ended around 12,000 years ago, and for a long time, people in Britain were hunter-gatherers, moving around to find food. It wasn't until around 6,000 years ago, during the Neolithic period, that farming really took hold. This is when people from the continent, likely from areas now in France and the Netherlands, started to settle and cultivate crops like wheat and barley, and domesticate animals like sheep and cattle. This transition to farming led to more settled communities, the development of villages, and the construction of monuments like Stonehenge. So, while there were people in Britain much earlier, the shift to a farming-based society, which fundamentally changed how people lived, occurred approximately 6,000 years ago. The other options are incorrect because they either predate the arrival of farming or are too recent to reflect this significant historical shift.
