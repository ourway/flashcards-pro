Remembrance Day, also known as Armistice Day, is observed on 11th November because it marks the anniversary of the end of World War I. The armistice, or agreement to stop fighting, was signed between the Allies and Germany on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918. This effectively brought the war to an end after more than four years of devastating conflict. Every year since then, the 11th of November has been dedicated to remembering the sacrifices made by members of the armed forces and civilians in times of war, specifically World War I and later conflicts. The poppy, a flower that grew on the battlefields of Flanders, has become a symbol of Remembrance Day. While November is certainly the month for remembering those who have died in conflict, the specific date is tied directly to the historical moment the First World War ended.
