Okay, so when we talk about official records of what happens in Parliament, we're talking about Hansard. Think of it as Parliament's official diary. The name "Hansard" actually comes from Thomas Curson Hansard, a printer who took over the publication of these reports in the early 19th century. Before him, various people had been recording parliamentary debates, but Hansard's name became synonymous with the official record. These reports are incredibly detailed, aiming to capture everything said in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. They're published daily while Parliament is in session and then compiled into bound volumes. So, while "Canvassing" refers to campaigning for votes, "Cabinets" are groups of senior government ministers, and the "Domesday Book" was a land survey from 1086, only Hansard provides a written record of parliamentary proceedings. It's a vital resource for anyone wanting to know exactly what was said and done in Parliament.
