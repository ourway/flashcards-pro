Okay, let's break down why Good Friday and Easter Monday are public holidays in the UK. Public or bank holidays are days when most businesses are closed, and people generally get a day off work. These holidays are usually established by law or tradition. In the UK, many public holidays have religious origins, and Easter is a prime example. Good Friday, which falls on the Friday before Easter Sunday, commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Easter Monday, the day after Easter Sunday, continues the Easter celebration. Because of their religious and cultural significance, these two days are legally recognized as public holidays across the UK. While April Fool's Day and St. Valentine's Day are celebrated, they are not official public holidays. Similarly, while the King's birthday is a public holiday, individual birthdays are not. So, when you think of spring bank holidays in the UK, remember that Good Friday and Easter Monday are key dates rooted in Christian tradition and officially recognized for time off.
