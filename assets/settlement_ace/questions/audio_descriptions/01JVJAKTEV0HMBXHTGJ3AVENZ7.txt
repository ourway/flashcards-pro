Horse racingâ€™s origins in Britain stretch way back to Roman times. When the Romans invaded and occupied Britain from 43 AD to 410 AD, they brought with them their customs and entertainment, including chariot racing. These races were held in purpose-built arenas, and while not exactly the same as modern horse racing, they definitely laid the groundwork. Think of it as the ancestor of today's sport! While horse racing became popular again during the Georgian and Victorian eras, those were periods of revival and formalization, not the origin. The Victorians, for example, established many of the rules and traditions we associate with racing today, but the sport itself had much earlier roots. So, while the Victorian era is known for its advancements in many areas, horse racing's true beginnings in Britain are firmly planted in the Roman era.
