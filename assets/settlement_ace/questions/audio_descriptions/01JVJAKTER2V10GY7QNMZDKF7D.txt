Okay, let's delve into the structure of the Scottish Parliament during the Middle Ages. Unlike the English Parliament which evolved into two houses – the House of Lords and the House of Commons – the Scottish Parliament operated with three distinct "Estates," often referred to as Houses. These were the Lords Spiritual, comprising bishops and abbots; the Lords Temporal, which included nobles and landowners; and the Commissioners of Burghs, representing the towns and cities. This three-part structure reflected the key power groups within Scottish society at the time. Each Estate had its own role and influence in the decision-making process. So, when you think about the medieval Scottish Parliament, remember that it wasn't a two-part system like England's. It was a more complex arrangement with three distinct voices shaping the laws and governance of Scotland. The other options might seem plausible if you're only familiar with the English system, but the three Estates are a unique feature of the historical Scottish Parliament.
