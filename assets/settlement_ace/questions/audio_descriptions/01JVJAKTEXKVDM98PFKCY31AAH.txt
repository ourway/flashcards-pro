Okay, let's break down why that statement about Northern Ireland and Scotland is false. Devolution is the key concept here. Devolution is when the UK Parliament grants some powers to national or regional bodies. Think of it like delegating responsibilities. Both Scotland and Northern Ireland have benefited from this process. Scotland has its own Parliament, established in 1999, located in Edinburgh. It has significant powers over areas like education, healthcare, and justice. Northern Ireland also has its own Assembly, located in Belfast, established under the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The Assembly allows locally elected representatives to make decisions on a range of issues specific to Northern Ireland. So, the statement is incorrect because it gets the facts wrong about both regions. Both have their own devolved governing bodies, a Parliament in Scotland and an Assembly in Northern Ireland. A common misconception is that only Scotland has a devolved body, perhaps because it's been in the news more, but it's important to remember Northern Ireland does too.
