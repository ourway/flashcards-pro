The Corn Laws, enacted in the early 19th century, were a series of measures designed to protect British agricultural producers. Think of "corn" in this context as referring to all grains, not just what Americans call corn. Essentially, these laws placed high tariffs on imported grain. The idea was to keep the price of British-grown grain high, benefiting landowners and farmers. However, this also meant that food prices were higher for everyone else, especially the poor. By 1846, a major debate raged about whether to repeal these laws. Supporters argued it would lower food prices and boost industry, while opponents feared it would ruin British agriculture. The Irish potato famine of the 1840s, which led to widespread starvation, intensified the pressure to repeal the Corn Laws. Finally, in 1846, Parliament voted to repeal them, marking a significant shift towards free trade in Britain. So, the statement that the Corn Laws blocked the import of inexpensive grain into Britain is indeed true; that was their very purpose until they were repealed.
