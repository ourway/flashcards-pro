The Paralympics are an international sporting event for athletes with disabilities, and Britain has a strong tradition of success in these games. When we think about British Paralympic heroes, David Weir is a name that immediately springs to mind. He's a wheelchair racer, specializing in events from 100 metres up to the marathon. Weir has won a staggering number of medals across multiple Paralympic Games, including six gold medals. His incredible speed, strength, and determination have made him a household name and an inspiration to many. Jessica Ennis-Hill is a celebrated Olympian, known for her heptathlon achievements, Andy Murray is a tennis superstar, and Bobby Moore captained England's World Cup-winning football team. While all are sporting legends, they are not primarily associated with the Paralympic Games, which is why David Weir is the correct answer here.
