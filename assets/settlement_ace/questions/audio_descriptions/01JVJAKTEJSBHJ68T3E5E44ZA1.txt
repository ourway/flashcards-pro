Okay, let's break down the structure of the UK Parliament. The UK operates under a parliamentary system, and at its heart lies the legislative branch, which is Parliament. Now, Parliament isn't just one big room of people; it's divided into two distinct parts, often referred to as houses. These are the House of Lords and the House of Commons. The House of Commons is made up of elected Members of Parliament, representing constituencies across the UK. They are directly chosen by the people in general elections. The House of Lords, on the other hand, has a more complex composition, including hereditary peers, life peers appointed for their expertise, and bishops of the Church of England. Historically, the Lords represented the aristocracy, while the Commons represented the common people. So, when we talk about the two houses that make up Parliament, it's the Lords and Commons working together to create and amend laws.
