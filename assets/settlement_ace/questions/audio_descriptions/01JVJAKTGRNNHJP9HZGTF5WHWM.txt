Elizabeth I's reign in the mid-16th century was a pivotal moment in English history, largely defined by religious upheaval. Her father, Henry VIII, had broken with the Catholic Church to establish the Church of England, but the religious landscape remained turbulent. Her half-sister, Mary I, a devout Catholic, attempted to reinstate Catholicism, earning her the nickname "Bloody Mary" for her persecution of Protestants. When Elizabeth ascended the throne in 1558, she re-established Protestantism as the state religion through the Act of Supremacy and the Act of Uniformity. While she sought a middle ground, a "via media," to avoid religious extremism and maintain stability, she remained firmly committed to the Protestant faith. This was crucial for England's political and economic alliances, as many European powers were Protestant. So, the statement that Queen Elizabeth I adhered to the Protestant faith is indeed true; it was a defining characteristic of her reign and a key factor in shaping England's future.
