World War II is one of the most significant events in modern history, and understanding its origins is key. Tensions had been building in Europe throughout the 1930s, with Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime in Germany aggressively expanding its territory and influence. While other nations were involved in the lead-up to the war, it was Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, that is widely considered the spark that ignited the global conflict. Britain and France had pledged to defend Poland, and following the invasion, they declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939. So, while Italy was an ally of Germany, and the USSR was initially allied with Germany before being invaded themselves, it was the invasion of Poland that triggered the declarations of war and the start of World War II. The USA did not enter the war until 1941.
