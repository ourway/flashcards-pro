Halloween, celebrated on October 31st, has roots stretching back to ancient Celtic traditions. The Celts believed that on this night, the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead blurred. They held festivals and lit bonfires to ward off evil spirits. When the Romans conquered Celtic lands, they added their own festivals, like honoring the dead. Over time, these customs evolved. The name "Halloween" itself comes from "All Hallows' Eve," the night before All Saints' Day, a Christian holiday. In the UK, Halloween is now a popular secular celebration. People dress up in costumes, often spooky ones, go trick-or-treating, carve pumpkins, and attend parties. So, October 31st is distinctly associated with Halloween due to this blend of ancient Celtic beliefs and later cultural adaptations. Valentine's Day is in February, Bonfire Night is November 5th, and Hogmanay is the Scottish New Year celebration on December 31st.
