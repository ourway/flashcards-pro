After the Second World War, there was a strong desire in Britain to build a better society, one that looked after its citizens "from the cradle to the grave." This led to the creation of the welfare state, a system designed to provide support for everyone, especially those in need. Two cornerstones of this new system were the National Health Service (NHS) and a comprehensive social security system. The NHS, established in 1948, provided free healthcare to all at the point of use, a revolutionary concept at the time. Before this, healthcare was often unaffordable for many. Simultaneously, the introduction of a social security system aimed to protect people from poverty and hardship by providing benefits for unemployment, sickness, and other circumstances. While state pensions and employment benefits were certainly components of the broader welfare state, the establishment of the NHS and the introduction of a comprehensive social security system represented the two most significant and overarching changes implemented between 1945 and 1950, fundamentally reshaping the relationship between the state and its citizens.
