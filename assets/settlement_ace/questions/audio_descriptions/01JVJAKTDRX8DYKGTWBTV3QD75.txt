The 18th century is often called the Age of Enlightenment, and for good reason! This period, spanning roughly from the late 1600s to the late 1700s, saw a huge surge in new ideas across many fields. Thinkers began to emphasize reason and individualism rather than tradition. In politics, philosophers like John Locke promoted ideas about natural rights and limited government, which heavily influenced the American and French Revolutions. In science, figures like Isaac Newton developed groundbreaking theories about gravity and motion, changing how people understood the universe. Philosophers like Voltaire and Rousseau questioned established norms and advocated for social reform. So, when we talk about the 18th century bringing advancements in politics, philosophy, and science, it's absolutely true. It was a time of intellectual ferment and revolutionary thinking that shaped the modern world.
