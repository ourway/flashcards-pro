The conflict you're thinking about is indeed called the Wars of the Roses. This name comes from the emblems associated with the two families vying for the English throne: the House of Lancaster, symbolized by a red rose, and the House of York, represented by a white rose. These wars were a series of bloody civil conflicts fought intermittently between 1455 and 1487. Think of it as a dynastic power struggle where noble families took sides, leading to battles, betrayals, and ultimately, a change in the ruling dynasty. The Wars of the Roses ended when Henry Tudor, who had Lancastrian connections, defeated Richard III of York at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Henry then married Elizabeth of York, uniting the two houses and establishing the Tudor dynasty, which adopted the Tudor rose as its symbol â€“ a combination of the red and white roses. So, while the conflict involved red and white roses, it wasn't simply called "The Wars of Red" or "The Wars of White," but rather "The Wars of the Roses" to reflect the symbols of the warring houses.
