Easter's timing is linked to the lunar calendar and the spring equinox, making it a movable feast that always falls between March and April. The spring equinox, around March 20th, marks the beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere. Early Christians decided that Easter would be celebrated on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the spring equinox. This connection to both the lunar cycle and the solar calendar is why Easter's date varies each year. It's a celebration rooted in both Christian tradition and ancient observations of the natural world. So, while June and July are firmly in summer, September and November in autumn, and December and January in winter, Easter is always a springtime festival, a time of rebirth and renewal, symbolized by the Easter bunny and springtime flowers.
