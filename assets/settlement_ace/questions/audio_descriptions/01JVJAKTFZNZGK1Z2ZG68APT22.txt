Okay, let's talk about UK landmarks. When we think of landmarks, we're generally referring to well-known, visually striking structures or places that are representative of a country or city. The UK is full of them! Edinburgh Castle, perched atop Castle Rock, is a prime example. It has a rich history dating back centuries, serving as a royal residence, military stronghold, and national symbol of Scotland. Then there's the London Eye, a giant Ferris wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames. Constructed in 1999, it quickly became a modern icon of London, offering stunning panoramic views of the city. Now, the Eisteddfod is a Welsh festival celebrating literature, music, and performing arts â€“ it's culturally significant, but not a physical landmark. The National Trust, on the other hand, is an organization that protects historical places and natural beauty in the UK, but it's not a landmark itself, rather it protects many landmarks. So, Edinburgh Castle and the London Eye are the clear choices here, representing both historical and modern iconic structures.
