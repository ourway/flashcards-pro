Forced marriage is a serious human rights violation, and the UK has been actively working to combat it. While England and Wales introduced specific legislation earlier, Scotland took a significant step in 2011 by implementing Forced Marriage Protection Orders. These orders are designed to prevent forced marriages from taking place and to provide protection and support to victims. The legislation gives the courts the power to issue orders that can prevent someone from being taken out of the country for the purpose of forced marriage, or to protect someone who has already been forced into marriage. It's important to remember that forced marriage is different from arranged marriage; arranged marriages are entered into with the free and informed consent of both parties. The introduction of these protection orders in 2011 demonstrates Scotland's commitment to safeguarding vulnerable individuals and upholding their right to choose.
