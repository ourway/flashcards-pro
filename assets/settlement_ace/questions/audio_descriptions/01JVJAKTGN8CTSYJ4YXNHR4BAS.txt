Terrorist groups, by their very nature, need to perpetuate their existence and further their aims, which are often political or ideological. To do this, they rely on a constant influx of new members and supporters. Radicalisation is the process by which individuals adopt extreme political, social, or religious ideals that justify violence and illegal actions. Conscription, in this context, refers to recruiting or enlisting individuals to actively participate in the group's activities, which often involve violence. Therefore, it's almost always true that terrorist factions attempt to radicalise and conscript people. Without radicalisation, they can't convince people to join their cause, and without conscription, they lack the manpower to carry out attacks or maintain their operations. Think of it like a business needing employees â€“ terrorist groups need recruits to survive. While some might focus more on one strategy than the other at different times, the underlying goal of expanding their influence and capabilities remains constant.
