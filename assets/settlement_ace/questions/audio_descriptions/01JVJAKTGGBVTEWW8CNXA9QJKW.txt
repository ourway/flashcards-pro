'Punch' magazine, a real institution in British humour, first hit newsstands in 1841, placing its debut firmly in the 1840s. Understanding the magazine's historical context helps lock in the answer. Think of the Victorian era, a time of great social change and industrial growth, but also ripe for satire. 'Punch' cleverly poked fun at the establishment, political figures, and everyday life, using witty cartoons and articles. It became incredibly popular, shaping public opinion and reflecting the concerns of the time. While the 1820s were the Georgian era, and the 1860s and 1880s were later Victorian decades, 'Punch' was already a well-established voice by then. It ran for over 150 years, finally ceasing publication in 2002, but its legacy as a pioneering satirical magazine remains.
