The 1960s were a transformative decade, and right at the start of it, a musical revolution was brewing in Liverpool. The Beatles, originally consisting of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe, and Pete Best, officially came together as a band in 1960. This was a pivotal moment not just for British music, but for global culture. Think about it: the early 60s were pre-Beatlemania, before they conquered America and changed pop music forever. While they had been playing together in various forms and under different names before 1960, it was in this year that they solidified their lineup and began their journey to international stardom. The other dates are way off; by 1970, The Beatles were breaking up, and by the 1980s, they were a distant, though legendary, memory. So, if you're thinking about the birth of Beatlemania and the start of their incredible career, 1960 is the year to remember.
