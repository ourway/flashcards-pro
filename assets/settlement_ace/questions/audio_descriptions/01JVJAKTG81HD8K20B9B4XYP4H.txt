Okay, here's the explanation:

In the UK, the law generally protects the identity of minors, that is, anyone under the age of 18, who are involved in criminal proceedings. This protection is in place to safeguard their future prospects and rehabilitation. Publishing the names or photos of young offenders can have a devastating impact on their lives, making it difficult for them to reintegrate into society and move on from their mistakes. While there might be a public interest in knowing about crimes, the welfare of the child is considered paramount. There are very specific circumstances where a court might lift this restriction, but these are exceptional cases, usually involving serious crimes or when it's deemed to be in the public interest to do so. So, the general rule is that the media cannot publish this information, ensuring a level of privacy and an opportunity for the young person to turn their life around. It's a key part of the UK's justice system that prioritizes rehabilitation over public shaming when it comes to minors.
