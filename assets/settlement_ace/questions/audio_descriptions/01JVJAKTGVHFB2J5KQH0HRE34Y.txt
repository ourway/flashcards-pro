World War I, often called the Great War, was a global conflict that reshaped the 20th century. It began in 1914, triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, and involved major powers like Britain, France, Russia, and later the United States, against Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. The war was devastating, introducing new technologies like trench warfare and chemical weapons, leading to millions of casualties. After years of intense fighting and stalemate, the tide began to turn in 1918. Germany, facing internal pressures and dwindling resources, signed an armistice on November 11, 1918, officially ending the war. So, the correct answer is 1918 because that's the year the guns finally fell silent, bringing an end to one of the deadliest conflicts in human history. The other years are incorrect because 1945 was the end of World War II, and 1922 and 1943 were simply years during the interwar and World War II periods, respectively.
