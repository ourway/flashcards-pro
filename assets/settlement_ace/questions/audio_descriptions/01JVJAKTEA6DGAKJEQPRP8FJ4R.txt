Newmarket in Suffolk has been the heart of British horseracing for centuries, earning it the nickname "Headquarters of British Horseracing." The town's connection to the sport dates back to the reign of James I in the early 17th century, who built a royal palace there and established Newmarket as a place for racing. Over time, it developed into a hub for thoroughbred breeding, training, and racing. Given this deep-rooted history, it makes perfect sense that the National Horseracing Museum is located in Newmarket. It showcases the history of the sport, its key figures, and the importance of horseracing to British culture. While Aintree is famous for the Grand National, and Scotland has a rich equestrian tradition, Newmarket is the specific location synonymous with the broader history and heritage of British horseracing, making it the home of the national museum dedicated to the sport.
