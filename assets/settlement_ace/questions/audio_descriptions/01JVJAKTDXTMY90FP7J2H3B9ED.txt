When you first arrive in the UK and want to drive, the rules are different depending on where your original driving license was issued. The UK recognizes licenses from EU countries, allowing you to use them until they expire. However, if your license is from a non-EU country, like the United States, Canada, or Australia, you can drive using that license for a limited period. This grace period is designed to allow you time to either exchange your license (if your country has an agreement with the UK) or take the UK driving test. The key thing to remember is that this period is for one year, or 12 months, from when you become a resident. After this 12-month period, you must have a UK driving license to continue driving legally. So, while the idea of driving for two or three years on your original license might sound appealing, it's not permitted under UK law. Failing to obtain a UK license after this period could lead to penalties.
