Okay, here's the explanation:

The UK electoral system distinguishes between different types of elections, and voting rights often depend on citizenship and residency status. While EU citizens living in the UK *can* vote in some elections, it's not a blanket right for *all* British public elections. For example, EU citizens are generally eligible to vote in local elections and elections for the European Parliament (when the UK was still a member of the EU). However, a key exception is General Elections, which determine who sits in the UK Parliament. To vote in a General Election, you generally need to be a British citizen, a qualifying Commonwealth citizen, or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland. So, while it might seem like EU residents should have full voting rights given their presence in the UK, the rules are more nuanced, and they are excluded from voting in the most important national elections. This distinction is rooted in the principle that electing the national government is a right reserved for those with a stronger connection to the country, typically through citizenship.
