The plague that devastated Britain in 1348 is famously known as the Black Death. This wasn't just any illness; it was a bubonic plague pandemic that swept across Europe, and Britain was hit hard. The name "Black Death" comes from one of the gruesome symptoms of the disease: dark blotches that appeared on the skin of the infected as they died. Imagine the terror this sight inspired! It's important to remember that this plague had a massive impact on British society, leading to huge labor shortages and ultimately contributing to social and economic changes. While "White Death" sounds ominous, it's not associated with this specific plague. Malaria, while a serious disease, is spread by mosquitoes, not the bubonic plague. And "Giant Evil," although descriptive of the plague's impact, is not the historical name given to it. So, the "Black Death" is the correct answer because it's the specific historical term used to describe this devastating plague outbreak in 1348.
