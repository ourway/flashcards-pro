The Corn Laws, a hot topic in 19th-century Britain, were essentially about protecting British landowners and farmers. Think of "corn" in this context not just as sweetcorn, but as grain in general, like wheat and barley â€“ the staple food source. The laws, which had been in place in various forms for centuries, placed high tariffs on imported grain. This meant that foreign grain, which was often cheaper, became expensive to buy in Britain. The idea was to keep the price of British-grown grain high, ensuring profits for British farmers. However, this also meant higher food prices for everyone else, especially the poor. By the 1840s, with increasing industrialization and a growing population, pressure mounted to repeal the Corn Laws. People argued that cheap imported grain would lower food prices, benefiting workers and boosting the economy. After a long and bitter political battle, they were finally repealed in 1846, marking a significant shift towards free trade. So, the statement is true because the Corn Laws did indeed block the import of inexpensive grain before their repeal.
