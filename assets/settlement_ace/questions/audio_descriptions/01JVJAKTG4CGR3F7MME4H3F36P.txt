In Scotland, the legal system has some distinct differences from that of England and Wales. One key difference lies in the structure of the courts. Sheriff Courts are the main local courts in Scotland, and they handle a wide range of civil and criminal cases. Think of the Sheriff Court as the workhorse of the Scottish legal system. They deal with everything from minor offenses to more serious crimes. The Sheriff Principal oversees the Sheriff Courts in a particular region. Now, why not the other options? Crown Courts are part of the English and Welsh legal system, dealing with serious criminal cases that have been passed on from the Magistrates' Court. Magistrates' Courts, also part of the English and Welsh system, generally handle less serious offenses. So, because we're talking about serious legal cases *in Scotland*, the Sheriff Court is the place where those cases are heard.
