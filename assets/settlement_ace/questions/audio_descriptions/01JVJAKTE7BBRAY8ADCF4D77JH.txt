In British politics, governments are formed by the party that wins the majority of seats in a general election. However, sometimes no single party wins an outright majority. When this happens, parties can form a coalition, where two or more parties join together to govern. In 2010, the general election resulted in what's called a hung parliament, meaning no party had enough seats to govern alone. After some negotiation, the Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, and the Liberal Democrats, led by Nick Clegg, agreed to form a coalition government. This was a significant moment, as it was the first coalition government in the UK since World War II. The Labour Party, while a major political force, did not join this coalition, remaining in opposition. The Communist party has never been a major political force in the UK. So, the coalition government formed in 2010 consisted of the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives.
