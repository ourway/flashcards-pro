Parliament plays a central role in the UK's democracy, and transparency is key to ensuring accountability. For many years, the public relied on newspapers and radio to learn about debates and decisions made in the Houses of Parliament. However, with the advent of television, a new era of accessibility began. Now, parliamentary proceedings, including debates in the House of Commons and House of Lords, are broadcast on television. This allows citizens to witness firsthand the arguments, discussions, and votes that shape the laws of the country. This direct access is crucial for an informed electorate. While newspapers and the internet also play a role in reporting, television broadcasts offer a real-time, unfiltered view of Parliament in action. It's worth noting that while the internet is used extensively to report on Parliament, the question is about how proceedings *are* reported, and the live broadcast is a key element.
