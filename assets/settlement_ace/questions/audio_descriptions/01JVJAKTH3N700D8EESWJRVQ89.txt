Before the 18th century, life in Britain was overwhelmingly rural. Think about it: the Industrial Revolution, with its factories and cities, hadn't happened yet. Most people lived in villages and the economy was based on what they could grow and raise. Agriculture, encompassing everything from farming crops like wheat and barley to raising livestock like sheep and cattle, was the foundation of the economy. It provided not just food, but also materials for clothing and other necessities. While there were certainly other jobs around, like blacksmiths or carpenters, the vast majority of people were involved in agriculture in some way. Building properties and creating new roads, while important, were not the primary source of employment. These were smaller-scale activities compared to the widespread need for agricultural labor to feed the population. So, if you picture pre-1700s Britain, imagine a land of fields and farms, where most people worked the land to survive.
