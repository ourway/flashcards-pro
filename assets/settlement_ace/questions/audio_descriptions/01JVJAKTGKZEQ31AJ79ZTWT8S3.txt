Okay, let's talk about British actors and the Oscars. The Academy Awards, or Oscars, are the most prestigious film awards in the United States, and winning one is a huge achievement for any actor. While Leonardo DiCaprio is a fantastic actor, he's American, so he's out of the running for this particular question. Jacky Stewart is a famous British racing driver, not an actor. Now, Colin Firth is a celebrated British actor known for roles in films like "The King's Speech," where he played King George VI. He won an Oscar for Best Actor for that role. Tilda Swinton is another highly acclaimed British actress, known for her versatility and roles in films like "Michael Clayton" and "Orlando." She won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in "Michael Clayton." So, the correct answer is Colin Firth and Tilda Swinton, as they are both British actors who have won Oscars.
