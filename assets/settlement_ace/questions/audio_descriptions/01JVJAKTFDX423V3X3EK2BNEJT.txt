The Industrial Revolution, which really took off in the late 1700s and throughout the 1800s, was a period of massive technological advancement, but it came at a significant human cost. Factories and mines sprung up rapidly, creating a huge demand for workers. However, there were virtually no regulations or laws in place to protect these workers. This meant employers could get away with incredibly long hours â€“ often 12 to 16 hours a day, six days a week. The environments were also incredibly dangerous. Machinery was often unguarded, leading to frequent accidents and injuries. There was little to no compensation for injuries, and safety standards were non-existent. Child labour was also rampant, with children as young as five or six working in these hazardous conditions. So, when we talk about working conditions during the Industrial Revolution, "very poor" is the only accurate description. While it's tempting to think things might have been "average" or even "acceptable," the historical reality is that workers faced truly appalling conditions that we would find completely unacceptable today.
