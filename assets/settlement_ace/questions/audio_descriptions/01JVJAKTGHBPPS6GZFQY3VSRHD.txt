Maiden Castle isn't your typical medieval castle with towering walls and knights. It's actually an Iron Age hill fort, one of the largest and most complex in Europe. These forts were built for defense and sometimes as settlements, dating back well over 2,000 years. Dorset, in southwest England, is particularly rich in Iron Age history, and Maiden Castle is its crown jewel. It's a massive earthwork, a series of ditches and ramparts, that dominates the landscape. While Danebury is another impressive hill fort, it's located in Hampshire, not Dorset. Cornwall, while also having ancient sites, isn't the location of Maiden Castle. So, when you think of ancient hill forts and the Iron Age in England, remember Dorset and its magnificent Maiden Castle. It's a key piece of Britain's pre-Roman history and a testament to the ingenuity and resilience of its early inhabitants.
