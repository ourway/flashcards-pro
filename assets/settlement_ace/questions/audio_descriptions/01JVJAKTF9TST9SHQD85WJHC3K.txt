The currency used in the United Kingdom is the pound sterling. It's helpful to remember that each country generally has its own official currency, and the UK is no exception. The pound has a long and fascinating history, dating back to Anglo-Saxon times, although the Bank of England, which issues banknotes, was only established in 1694. While the Euro is used in many countries within the European Union, the UK chose to retain its own currency even when it was a member of the EU. The dollar is the currency of the United States, and the Yen is the currency of Japan. So, when you're thinking about money in the UK, always remember the pound sterling â€“ it's a key part of the UK's identity and economic independence.
