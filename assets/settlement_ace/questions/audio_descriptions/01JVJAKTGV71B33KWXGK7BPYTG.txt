The Magna Carta, meaning "Great Charter," is a cornerstone of British legal history, and it dates all the way back to 1215. Think of it as one of the earliest attempts to limit the power of the monarch. King John, who wasn't exactly known for his popularity, was forced by a group of rebellious barons to agree to a set of rules that protected their rights. Before this, the king was pretty much seen as above the law. The Magna Carta established principles like the right to a fair trial and the idea that even the king had to follow the law. While it didn't immediately create a perfect democracy, it set a crucial precedent. It's important to remember that the Magna Carta wasn't about the common person initially, but it laid the groundwork for future legal reforms that would benefit everyone. So, while 1314, 1415, and 1514 might sound plausible, they're centuries off from this pivotal moment in English legal history.
