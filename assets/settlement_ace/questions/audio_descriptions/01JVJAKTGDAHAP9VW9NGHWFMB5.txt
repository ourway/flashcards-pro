Cricket's story is deeply intertwined with England's history. While its exact origins are debated, most historians trace it back to the 16th century in the south of England. By the 18th century, cricket had become England's national sport, spreading through the British Empire. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), founded in 1787 and based at Lord's Cricket Ground in London, became the guardian of the laws of the game. This is why England is considered the birthplace of cricket, even though it's hugely popular in countries like India, Australia, and South Africa today. These nations adopted and developed the sport as part of their own cultural identities, but the initial spark and formalization happened in England. So, while you might associate cricket strongly with the Indian subcontinent or Australia due to their passionate fan bases and successful teams, its roots are firmly planted in English soil.
