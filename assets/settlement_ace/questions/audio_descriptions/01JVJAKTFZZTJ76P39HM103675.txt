Okay, let's talk about UK banknotes. The Bank of England is responsible for printing banknotes in England and Wales, and these come in denominations of £5, £10, £20, and £50. Scottish banks also issue banknotes, and while they might have some slightly different designs, they also stick to these same denominations. So, you'll find a fiver, a tenner, a twenty, and a fifty in circulation. Now, while it might be tempting to think there's a £100 note out there, perhaps because you've seen them in other countries, the UK doesn't actually issue them. It's simply not a denomination used. So, if you were asked which of a list isn't a valid UK banknote, the £100 note would be the odd one out. It's a good thing to remember, especially when you're handling cash!
