William the Conqueror, a pivotal figure in British history, was the Duke of Normandy. Normandy, at the time of William's birth around 1028, was a duchy in northern France. Think of it as a region with its own ruler, but still part of the larger kingdom of France. In 1066, William famously crossed the English Channel with his Norman army and defeated King Harold at the Battle of Hastings. This Norman Conquest had a massive impact on England, introducing French language, law, and culture. So, while William became King of England, his origins were firmly rooted in France. The other options are incorrect because Spain was a separate kingdom, the United Kingdom didn't exist yet, and Norway, while having Viking connections to Normandy, was not William's homeland. It's a common mistake to think of him as English because he became King of England, but he was French by birth and upbringing!
