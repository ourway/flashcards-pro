Civil law deals with disputes between individuals or organizations, focusing on private rights and remedies. Think of it as the set of rules governing everyday interactions, contracts, and responsibilities we have towards each other. It's different from criminal law, which involves offenses against the state and carries punishments like imprisonment. Now, debt falls squarely within the realm of civil law because it involves a financial obligation between two parties. If someone owes you money and refuses to pay, you would pursue a civil case to recover that debt. On the other hand, drunk and disorderly behaviour, burglary, and violent crime are all offenses against the state. These are criminal matters, investigated and prosecuted by the police and the Crown Prosecution Service, not individuals pursuing private claims. So, while owing money might feel like a crime sometimes, it's a civil matter, making "debt" the correct answer here.
