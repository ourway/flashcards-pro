William Wordsworth is the poet who wrote "The Daffodils," also known as "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud." Wordsworth was a key figure in the Romantic movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, which emphasized emotion, nature, and individual experience. "The Daffodils," published in 1807, perfectly embodies these themes. The poem describes a walk Wordsworth took with his sister Dorothy near Ullswater in the Lake District, where they saw a field of daffodils. The experience deeply moved Wordsworth, and he later wrote the poem to capture that feeling of joy and connection with nature. While William Blake is known for his mystical and symbolic poetry, Robert Browning for his dramatic monologues, and Lord Byron for his passionate and rebellious verse, none of them are associated with "The Daffodils." It's Wordsworth's celebration of a simple, natural scene that makes "The Daffodils" such a beloved and recognizable poem.
