The UK electoral system aims to be as accessible as possible to encourage widespread participation. To achieve this, polling stations need to accommodate a variety of schedules. Think about people who work early shifts, those who work late, and everyone in between. Setting the hours from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm provides a wide window for people to cast their votes before or after work, or even during a lunch break. While it might seem logical to have polling stations open during standard business hours, like 9 am to 5 pm, or even a slightly extended workday like 8 am to 8 pm, these options would exclude many voters. The 7 am to 10 pm timeframe has become a standard feature of UK elections, designed to maximize voter turnout by offering convenient options for nearly everyone.
