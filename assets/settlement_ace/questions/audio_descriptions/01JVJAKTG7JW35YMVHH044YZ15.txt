Scottish banknotes are indeed valid throughout the UK, although you might encounter some confusion. The key thing to understand is that all banknotes in the UK, including those issued by Scottish banks, are technically promissory notes. This means the issuing bank promises to pay the bearer the stated amount in legal currency, which is Bank of England notes. While Scottish banks like the Bank of Scotland, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and Clydesdale Bank are authorized to issue banknotes, they must hold an equivalent amount of Bank of England notes as backing. So, legally, shops and businesses *can* accept them. The reason some people hesitate is simply unfamiliarity. English retailers, especially smaller ones, might not see Scottish notes often and worry about their authenticity, but they are legal tender. It's a fun fact that highlights the UK's unique banking system and the nuances of legal tender versus common acceptance!
