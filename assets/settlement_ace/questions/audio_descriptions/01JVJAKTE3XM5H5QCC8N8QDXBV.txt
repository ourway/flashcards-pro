The Commonwealth is all about historical ties to the British Empire. Think of it as a club of countries that were mostly, but not always, previously ruled by Britain. This historical connection is key. Australia and Canada were both British colonies and later became self-governing dominions within the British Empire. They maintain strong links with the UK and the British monarch, who is still the Head of the Commonwealth. This shared history and continued association make them core members. Russia, on the other hand, has never been part of the British Empire. The USA, while initially formed from British colonies, broke away through revolution in the 18th century and is now completely independent. So, while the USA and UK have a close relationship, the USA isn't part of the Commonwealth because it doesn't share that history of being part of the British Empire. It's all about that shared past and ongoing association.
