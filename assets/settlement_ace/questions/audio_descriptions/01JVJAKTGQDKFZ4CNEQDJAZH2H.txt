Vaisakhi is a really important festival for Sikhs, marking the start of the Sikh New Year and commemorating the formation of the Khalsa in 1699. The Khalsa is the collective body of initiated Sikhs, established by Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru. This event is hugely significant in Sikh history and identity. Now, the Sikh calendar is based on the solar cycle, and Vaisakhi always falls in April. While the exact date can vary slightly each year depending on the solar calendar, it's consistently celebrated in April. So, while you might be tempted to think of other spring months, remember that Vaisakhi's connection to the solar calendar firmly places it in April, making it a celebration deeply rooted in the spring season.
