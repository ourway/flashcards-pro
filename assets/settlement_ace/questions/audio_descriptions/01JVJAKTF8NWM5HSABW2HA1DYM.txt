R. A. Butler, often referred to as "Rab" Butler, was a prominent figure in British politics, particularly during the mid-20th century. He's best remembered as a leading Conservative politician who held numerous high-ranking positions in government. Now, while he was certainly intelligent and well-read, leading some to perhaps think of him as an economist or even a poet, his career was firmly rooted in the political sphere. He served as a Member of Parliament for over 30 years and held key roles like Chancellor of the Exchequer and Home Secretary. He was also instrumental in shaping Conservative party policy, particularly in education. So, while the other options might sound plausible in a general knowledge context, remembering Butler's long and influential career in the Conservative party makes "A Conservative MP" the only accurate answer. He was a key figure in the post-war consensus, known for his pragmatic and reforming approach to politics.
