The 1830s were a time of significant change, but not quite the era of jet engines and radar. Think about the Victorian era, dominated by steam power and early industrial machinery. The 1830s saw advancements like the electric telegraph and the development of photography, but these were still relatively early days for technology. Jet engines and radar are products of the 20th century, specifically the build-up to and during the Second World War. Sir Frank Whittle patented the first turbojet engine in 1930, with the first jet engine aircraft taking flight in 1941. Radar technology also rapidly developed in the 1930s as countries prepared for war. So, while the 1830s were innovative, attributing jet engines and radar to that period is jumping the gun by about a century. It's easy to get confused with all the dates, but remembering the context of these inventions helps: they were born out of the urgent need for advanced military technology in the lead-up to World War II.
