Downing Street in London is more than just an address; it's the heart of the UK government. Number 10 Downing Street has been the official residence and workplace of the British Prime Minister since 1735. King George II offered the house to Sir Robert Walpole, often regarded as the first Prime Minister, as a gift, but Walpole only accepted it as an official residence. It's a relatively modest building, especially when you consider its significance. The Prime Minister doesn't actually own the building; it's held in trust by the Crown. While the Palace of Westminster is where Parliament meets and Buckingham Palace is the residence of the monarch, the Prime Minister's base of operations is firmly at Number 10. The Cabinet meets there, important decisions are made, and it's where the PM welcomes world leaders. So, while other locations are important to the UK government, 10 Downing Street is the specific place where the Prime Minister lives and works.
