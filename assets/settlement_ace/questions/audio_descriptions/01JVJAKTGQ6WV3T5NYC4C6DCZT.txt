Hadrian's Wall is one of the most iconic Roman structures in Britain, and it's a key piece of Roman history you'll need to know. The Roman Empire, at its height, controlled a vast territory, including much of Britain. However, they struggled to control the northernmost parts of the island, which was inhabited by the Picts, the ancestors of the Scottish people. These groups were fierce warriors and constantly raided Roman settlements. To protect the Roman territory and keep these raiders out, Emperor Hadrian ordered the construction of a massive wall around 122 AD. This wall stretched for about 80 miles across northern England, from coast to coast. That's why Emperor Hadrian is the correct answer. While other Roman figures like Julius Caesar and Emperor Claudius were involved in the Roman conquest of Britain, Hadrian is specifically associated with building the wall. Boudicca, on the other hand, was a British queen who led a rebellion against the Romans, so she definitely wouldn't have built a wall for them!
