Marriage in the UK is fundamentally based on the principle of individual autonomy and free will. Historically, arranged marriages were more common, where families played a significant role in choosing partners. However, modern British law and societal values emphasize that marriage should be a voluntary union between two individuals who genuinely consent to the partnership. This emphasis on personal choice reflects broader values of individual liberty and equality. Therefore, the only way a marriage can be valid is if both individuals entering into it give their full and free consent. The parents or any other third party cannot consent on their behalf. Consent must be freely given without any coercion, pressure, or deception. This ensures that marriage is a partnership built on mutual love, respect, and understanding, rather than familial obligation or other external factors.
