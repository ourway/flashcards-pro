The Proms, short for the Promenade Concerts, are a cornerstone of British cultural life, specifically dedicated to orchestral classical music. This isn't just any music festival; it's an eight-week summer celebration held primarily at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The Proms were founded in 1895 by Robert Newman and conductor Henry Wood with the aim of bringing classical music to a wider audience. The name "Promenade Concerts" comes from the fact that originally, audience members could walk around, or "promenade," during the performances, making it a more relaxed and accessible experience. While the Proms have evolved over the years, the core focus remains on showcasing the best of classical orchestral music, from well-known masterpieces to contemporary compositions. So, while you might find other genres of music celebrated elsewhere in the UK, The Proms are specifically and traditionally about orchestral classical music.
