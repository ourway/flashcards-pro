After World War II, Britain faced a significant labor shortage. The war had taken a heavy toll, and the economy needed a boost to rebuild and recover. To address this, the British government actively encouraged immigration, particularly from the Commonwealth countries. The British Nationality Act of 1948 granted citizenship to all people living in Commonwealth countries and gave them the right to work in the UK. This led to a wave of immigration, primarily from the Caribbean, India, and Pakistan. These new arrivals filled essential roles in industries like transport, healthcare, and manufacturing, contributing significantly to the post-war economic recovery. So, the statement is true because immigration was indeed encouraged for economic reasons during the 1950s to address labor shortages and stimulate economic growth. It's interesting to note that while this immigration was economically beneficial, it also laid the foundation for a more multicultural and diverse Britain.
