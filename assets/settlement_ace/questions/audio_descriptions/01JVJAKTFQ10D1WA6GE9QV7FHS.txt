Chequers is the British Prime Minister's official country residence, a place for them to unwind and host important guests away from the hustle and bustle of Downing Street. The house itself is a beautiful 16th-century manor located in Buckinghamshire. It was given to the nation in 1917 by Sir Arthur Lee, who wanted to provide a retreat for the Prime Minister of the day and future leaders. The idea was to give them a place for peace and quiet, and also somewhere suitable to entertain foreign dignitaries. So, while Edinburgh Castle, Windsor Castle, and the House of Lords are all significant British landmarks, they serve different purposes. Edinburgh and Windsor are royal residences and historic sites, while the House of Lords is part of Parliament. Chequers, specifically, is the Prime Minister's countryside escape. It's a perk of the job, offering a space for both relaxation and more informal diplomatic meetings.
