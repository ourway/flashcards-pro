Okay, let's break down voter registration in the UK. Generally, Great Britain, which includes England, Scotland, and Wales, operates under a system of household registration. This means one person in a household can register everyone who is eligible to vote at that address. It's designed to be convenient and efficient. However, Northern Ireland is the exception. Due to its unique political history and the need to prevent electoral fraud, Northern Ireland uses individual registration. Each eligible voter there must complete their own registration form. This system ensures a higher level of accuracy and accountability in the electoral process. So, the statement that Wales and Scotland use individual registration is incorrect because they are part of Great Britain and use household registration. It's easy to get confused because individual registration sounds like it would be the standard, but it's specifically a measure in Northern Ireland.
