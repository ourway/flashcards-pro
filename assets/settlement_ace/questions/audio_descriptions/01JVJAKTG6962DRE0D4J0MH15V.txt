Okay, let's talk about the Roman occupation of Britain. It's a really significant period in British history, and understanding its duration helps put a lot of things into perspective. The Romans first landed in Britain in 55 BC with Julius Caesar, but this was more of a reconnaissance mission than a full-scale invasion. The real Roman conquest began in 43 AD under Emperor Claudius. From that point, Roman influence spread across much of what is now England and Wales, though they never fully conquered Scotland. They built roads, towns, bathhouses, and introduced their laws and customs. This Roman period lasted for roughly four centuries, or 400 years, until around 410 AD when the Roman Empire was weakening and needed its legions to defend other territories. So, while 50, 100, or even 200 years might seem like a long time, they fall far short of the actual length of Roman rule, which left an indelible mark on British culture and infrastructure.
