Oliver Cromwell remains a controversial figure in Ireland due to his brutal military campaign in the mid-17th century. In 1649, Cromwell led the English Parliamentarian forces to Ireland to suppress Royalist support. His campaign was marked by sieges, massacres, and widespread confiscation of land from Irish Catholics, which was then given to English Protestant settlers. The sieges of Drogheda and Wexford, where his troops killed many civilians, are particularly remembered for their brutality. These actions led to significant loss of life, displacement, and lasting resentment towards Cromwell in Irish history. While figures like Nelson, Cook, and Drake are important in British history, their actions didn't have the same devastating impact on Ireland, making Cromwell the obvious choice as the controversial figure. The scars of Cromwell's campaign are still felt in Ireland today, making him a figure of intense debate and historical significance.
