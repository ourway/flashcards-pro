Okay, let's talk about New Delhi and its architect. When the British decided to move the capital of India from Calcutta to Delhi in the early 20th century, they envisioned a grand, modern city that would symbolize their power and influence. The man chosen to lead this monumental project was Sir Edwin Lutyens. He was a prominent British architect known for his classical style, often blended with modern sensibilities. Lutyens began work on New Delhi around 1912, and the city was officially inaugurated in 1931. His design included iconic structures like the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Residence) and India Gate. So, while Robert Adam, Inigo Jones, and Sir Christopher Wren were all significant architects in British history, they weren't involved in the design of New Delhi. Adam is known for his neo-classical country houses, Jones brought Italian Renaissance architecture to England, and Wren famously rebuilt London after the Great Fire. Lutyens, however, is specifically associated with the planning and architecture of New Delhi, making him the correct answer.
