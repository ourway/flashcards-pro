Okay, let's talk about the European Union. The EU is a political and economic alliance of European countries that was formed after the Second World War to foster cooperation and prevent future conflicts. It evolved from the European Economic Community, established in 1957 with just six founding members. Over the decades, more countries joined, expanding the EU's reach and influence. It's important to remember that the number of member states has changed over time. For example, the UK was a member but left in 2020, an event known as Brexit. Currently, there are 27 member countries in the European Union. So, while other numbers might sound plausible, 27 is the accurate figure reflecting the current composition of the EU. It's a dynamic organization, so staying updated on the membership is key!
