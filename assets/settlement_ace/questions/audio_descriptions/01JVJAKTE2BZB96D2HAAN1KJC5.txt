Wales boasts a rich culinary heritage, and while the UK shares many dishes, certain foods are particularly Welsh. Welsh cakes, also known as *pice ar y maen* (cakes on the stone), are a perfect example. These are small, round cakes, traditionally cooked on a griddle, and they're a staple treat found throughout Wales. They're made with flour, butter, eggs, milk, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg, sometimes with currants or raisins mixed in. Roast beef is more associated with England, especially as a traditional Sunday lunch. Fish and chips are popular throughout the UK, not just Wales. Haggis is distinctly Scottish, and an Ulster fry is an Irish breakfast staple. So, while all the options are eaten somewhere in the UK, Welsh cakes are the uniquely Welsh option, deeply embedded in the country's food culture and history.
