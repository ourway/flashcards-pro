National Insurance is a vital part of the UK's social security system, established in 1911 to provide a safety net for workers. Think of it as a collective pot of money that working people contribute to throughout their lives. These contributions are primarily used to fund state benefits, with the two biggest being the state retirement pension and healthcare through the National Health Service (NHS). The state pension provides income for people after they retire, ensuring they have some financial support in their later years. The NHS provides free healthcare to all UK residents. While education is also funded by the government through taxation, National Insurance contributions are specifically earmarked for pensions and healthcare. So, while it might seem like all government funds are interchangeable, National Insurance has a specific purpose, and that purpose does not include funding education.
