The Man Booker Prize, now simply known as the Booker Prize, is all about celebrating great writing. It's a prestigious award given annually to the best single work of sustained fiction, written in the English language and published in the UK and Ireland. The prize has a rich history, starting in 1969, and it's become a really important marker of literary achievement. Think of it as the Oscars, but for books! It aims to promote the reading of quality fiction and bring it to a wider audience. While movies, theatre, and music are all fantastic art forms, they have their own dedicated awards and recognition. The Booker Prize is specifically designed to honor the talent and creativity of authors and their novels, so literature is the only field that fits.
