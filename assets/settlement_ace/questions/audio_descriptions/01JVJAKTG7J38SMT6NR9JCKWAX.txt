Okay, let's talk gardens! The UK is famous for its stunning gardens, reflecting centuries of horticultural passion and design. When we think of notable gardens, we're talking about places specifically cultivated for their beauty and plant collections, not natural landscapes. Sissinghurst Castle Garden in Kent, created by Vita Sackville-West and her husband Harold Nicolson in the 1930s, is renowned for its romantic design and themed garden 'rooms'. It's a real icon of English gardening. Bodnant Garden in North Wales, on the other hand, boasts spectacular views of Snowdonia and features a diverse collection of plants from around the world, thanks to generations of careful plant collecting by the Aberconway family. It's particularly famous for its Laburnum Arch, a breathtaking tunnel of golden flowers in late spring. Snowdonia itself is a national park, a beautiful mountainous region, but not a specific garden. Similarly, the London Eye is a famous landmark, but it's an observation wheel, not a garden! So, Sissinghurst and Bodnant are the clear choices when we're talking about notable gardens.
