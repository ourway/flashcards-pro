Okay, let's talk about British classical music! When we think about distinguished composers from Britain, we're looking for figures who made significant contributions to the classical music landscape *within* the UK. Henry Purcell, who lived in the 17th century (1659-1695), is a prime example. He was a leading English composer of the Baroque period, known for his operas, anthems, and other works. He even served as organist at Westminster Abbey! Then we have Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958), a 20th-century composer who drew heavily on English folk music for inspiration. His works, like "Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis," are distinctly British in character. Now, while Claude Debussy was a brilliant composer, he was French, not British. And Johann Sebastian Bach, while arguably the most important composer of the Baroque era, was German. So, while they are giants of classical music, they don't fit the criteria of being *British* composers. Purcell and Vaughan Williams are quintessential figures in the story of British classical music.
