Okay, so the conflict known as the Hundred Years War is a classic example of history being a bit… messy. It wasn't actually a single, continuous war, but rather a series of conflicts fought between England and France, primarily over who should rule France. These conflicts stretched from 1337 to 1453. That's a whopping 116 years! The main reason it's called the "Hundred Years War" is because the major hostilities were concentrated within that rough timeframe. It involved famous battles like Crécy and Agincourt, and iconic figures like Joan of Arc. Now, the other options are important battles in British history, but they weren't protracted wars against France. The Battle of Hastings in 1066 was a Norman invasion, and Bannockburn in 1314 was a Scottish victory against England. Agincourt was a battle *during* the Hundred Years War, not the war itself. So, while the name is a bit misleading, the Hundred Years War is the correct answer because it represents that extended period of conflict between England and France.
