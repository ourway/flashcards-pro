Hadrian's Wall is a fascinating piece of Roman history right in the north of England. Think of it as a physical boundary built by the Roman Empire back in AD 122, during the reign of Emperor Hadrian â€“ hence the name! Its main purpose was to defend the Roman province of Britannia from the Picts, who lived in what is now Scotland. The wall stretched for about 73 miles, from the east coast to the west coast of northern England. It wasn't just a wall, though; it included forts, milecastles, and turrets for soldiers to patrol and keep watch. So, while Wales, Scotland, and Ireland all have their own rich histories and beautiful landscapes, Hadrian's Wall is specifically located in the north of England, marking the northern frontier of the Roman Empire at that time. It's a popular tourist attraction today, and a great reminder of Britain's long and varied past.
