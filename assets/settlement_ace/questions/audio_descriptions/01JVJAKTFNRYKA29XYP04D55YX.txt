Okay, let's untangle the Crimean War. This conflict, which raged from 1853 to 1856, is a classic example of shifting alliances in European history. The main issue was Russia's expansionist ambitions towards the Ottoman Empire, which included modern-day Turkey. Russia wanted more influence over the Ottoman territories. Britain and France, wary of Russia's growing power in the region, stepped in to support the Ottoman Empire *against* Russia. So, the key here is that Britain and France were actually allies *with* Turkey, fighting *against* Russia. Think of it like a team-up to prevent Russia from becoming too dominant. The war itself was notoriously mismanaged, but it did have lasting effects, including inspiring Florence Nightingale's nursing reforms. Therefore, the statement that Britain and France fought against Turkey is incorrect; they were on the same side.
