The European Parliament is a really important part of how the European Union works. It's the directly elected body of the EU, meaning citizens from all member countries get to choose their representatives. These Members of the European Parliament, or MEPs, are there to represent the interests of the people and to make laws for the EU. Now, to make sure there's regular accountability and fresh perspectives, elections for the European Parliament are held every five years. This five-year cycle ensures that the Parliament remains responsive to the changing needs and opinions of the European population. While some might think it's every four years, perhaps confusing it with some national election cycles, or even six, the established term length for MEPs is firmly set at five years. This allows them enough time to develop and implement policies while also ensuring regular democratic renewal.
