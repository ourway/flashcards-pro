The two-minute silence observed on Remembrance Day is a deeply significant tradition in the UK, commemorating the end of World War One. The key to understanding this question lies in remembering the date the armistice was signed: the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. This refers to 11 AM on November 11th, the time when the guns fell silent, signaling the end of the war. However, the war didn't end in 1911. World War One began in 1914 and lasted until 1918. Therefore, the correct year for the armistice is 1918. While it might be tempting to think the statement is true because you remember the 11th hour, 11th day, and 11th month, the incorrect year makes the whole statement false. The two-minute silence is a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made during the war, and remembering the correct year, 1918, is crucial to understanding its historical context.
