Okay, let's break down the story of Charles II and his restoration to the throne. After the execution of King Charles I in 1649, England became a republic under Oliver Cromwell. This period, known as the Interregnum, lasted until Cromwell's death. People were increasingly unhappy with the strict Puritan rule. Charles I's son, Charles, had been living in exile, mainly in France. By 1660, there was a strong desire to restore the monarchy. Parliament invited Charles to return and take the throne. He landed in England and was crowned King Charles II in 1660, marking the end of the Interregnum and the beginning of the Restoration period. So, the correct statement is that Charles, King of Scotland, was restored as King Charles II of England in 1660. It's important to remember that he was already a king, just not of England at that moment. Bonnie Prince Charlie, on the other hand, is a figure from a later period, the 18th century, associated with the Jacobite risings, which aimed to restore the Stuart dynasty to the throne much later on.
