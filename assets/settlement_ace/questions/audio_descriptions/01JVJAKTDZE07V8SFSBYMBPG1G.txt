Okay, let's break down why 1928 is a pivotal year for women's voting rights in the UK. The fight for women's suffrage was a long and hard-won battle. While some women, specifically those over 30 who met certain property qualifications, gained the right to vote in 1918, this wasn't full equality. Think of it as a partial victory. The 1918 Representation of the People Act was a start, acknowledging women's contributions during the First World War, but it didn't go far enough. It wasn't until the Equal Franchise Act of 1928 that women finally achieved equal voting rights with men. This act lowered the voting age for women to 21, matching the existing voting age for men. So, 1928 is significant because it marked the moment when the UK finally granted women the same voting rights as men, solidifying their place in the democratic process. It's easy to see why some might think women could vote at 18, mirroring the current voting age, but that change came much later.
