The push for Home Rule in Ireland, which would have granted Ireland a degree of self-government within the United Kingdom, was a long and hard-fought battle throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Several Home Rule bills were proposed, but faced significant opposition, particularly from unionists who wanted Ireland to remain part of the UK. Finally, in 1914, the Government of Ireland Act was passed, granting Home Rule. However, its implementation was immediately delayed because of the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. The war effort took precedence, and the British government felt it couldn't manage both a major war and the potential upheaval of implementing Home Rule simultaneously. It was feared that implementing Home Rule during wartime would divide the country and weaken the war effort. While the Second World War, the absence of a king, or the Black Death were all significant historical events, they didn't directly impact the 1914 Home Rule Act. The Act was eventually superseded by later events, including the Easter Rising in 1916 and the subsequent Irish War of Independence, ultimately leading to the partition of Ireland and the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922.
