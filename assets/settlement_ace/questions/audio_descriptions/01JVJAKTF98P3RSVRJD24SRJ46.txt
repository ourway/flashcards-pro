Queen Elizabeth II's reign was a long and historically significant one, making her the longest-reigning British monarch. Jubilees mark significant milestones in a monarch's reign, and they're a big deal in the UK, often celebrated with national holidays and festivities. The Silver Jubilee marks 25 years, the Golden Jubilee 50 years, the Diamond Jubilee 60 years, and the Platinum Jubilee 70 years. In 2012, the UK celebrated the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, marking 60 years since she acceded to the throne in 1952 after the death of her father, King George VI. So, the correct answer is 60. While 50 years is also a significant milestone, marked by the Golden Jubilee, it wasn't the one celebrated in 2012.
