The Glorious Revolution of 1688 is called "glorious" precisely because it achieved significant political change with minimal bloodshed within England itself. The context here is the ongoing power struggle between the monarchy and Parliament. For decades, kings like Charles I and James II had tried to assert absolute power, often clashing with Parliament. James II's pro-Catholic policies and attempts to bypass Parliament created widespread discontent. To avoid a civil war, leading English figures invited William of Orange, the Protestant ruler of the Netherlands and James II's son-in-law, to take the throne. When William landed with his army, James II fled to France. This is why the statement is true. The revolution confirmed the supremacy of Parliament through the Bill of Rights in 1689, which limited the monarch's powers and guaranteed certain rights to the people. While there was some fighting in Scotland and Ireland related to the revolution, the key point is the relative lack of conflict in England itself, leading to its "glorious" moniker and the establishment of parliamentary power.
