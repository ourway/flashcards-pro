The Tour de France is one of the most prestigious and grueling cycling races in the world, attracting top athletes from across the globe. It wasn't until relatively recently that a Brit managed to conquer this iconic event. While British cyclists had participated for years, the first to actually win the overall title was Bradley Wiggins in 2012. His victory was a huge moment for British cycling, marking a turning point and inspiring a new generation of cyclists. Now, while Mo Farah is a celebrated long-distance runner, Andy Murray a tennis superstar, and Sir Chris Hoy a dominant track cyclist, none of them have ever competed, let alone won, the Tour de France. So, Bradley Wiggins stands alone as the first British victor in this challenging French race.
