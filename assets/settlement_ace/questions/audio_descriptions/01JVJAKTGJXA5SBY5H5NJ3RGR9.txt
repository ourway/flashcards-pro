Mary Stuart, also known as Mary, Queen of Scots, had a truly dramatic start to her life. Her father, King James V of Scotland, died unexpectedly just six days after she was born in 1542. This was a turbulent time in Scottish history, with tensions high between Scotland and England. Because she was his only surviving legitimate child, Mary instantly became Queen of Scotland upon her father's death. Think about it â€“ she inherited the throne when she was only about a week old! This makes the answer "a week" correct. The other options, like 1, 4, or 9 years old, are incorrect because they significantly overestimate her age at the time of her accession. A regency, led by various nobles, ruled in her place until she was old enough to govern herself. It's quite remarkable to consider that someone so young could inherit such a powerful position, setting the stage for a life filled with political intrigue and ultimately, tragedy.
