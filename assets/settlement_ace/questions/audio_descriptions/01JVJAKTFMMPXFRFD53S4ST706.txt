The story of the Roman invasion of Britain is a bit like a persistent salesperson finally making a sale. Julius Caesar actually led expeditions to Britain in both 55 BC and 54 BC, but these were more like reconnaissance missions or raids. He didn't establish a permanent Roman presence. Think of it as him testing the waters. It wasn't until nearly a century later, in 43 AD, under the Emperor Claudius, that the Romans launched a full-scale, successful invasion. This time, they came to stay. They established a province, built roads, towns, and forts, and remained in control of much of Britain for almost 400 years. So, while the earlier dates mark initial Roman interest, 43 AD is the pivotal year when Roman Britain truly began. The other options are incorrect because they predate the actual conquest or are simply the wrong year.
