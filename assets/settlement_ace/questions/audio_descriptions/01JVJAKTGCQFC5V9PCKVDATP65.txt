The term "Secretary of State" refers to a senior government minister responsible for a specific department. The UK government is structured around various departments, each handling a particular area of public policy. The Secretary of State is the political head of that department, accountable to Parliament for its actions and policies. This role evolved over centuries, with the first Secretaries of State emerging in the 16th century. Today, different Secretaries of State oversee crucial areas like education, health, defense, and others. While the Chancellor of the Exchequer is responsible for financial matters, the Foreign Secretary handles international relations, and the Home Secretary deals with domestic affairs like crime and immigration, it's the Secretary of State title that broadly covers the political head of a department like education, health, or defense. So, while the other roles are important, they have narrower remits than the general oversight implied by the term "Secretary of State."
