The relationship between the House of Commons and the House of Lords is a key aspect of the UK's parliamentary system. Historically, the House of Lords, composed of unelected peers, held significant power, often blocking legislation passed by the Commons. However, over centuries, reforms have shifted the balance of power decisively towards the elected House of Commons. The Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 were pivotal. The 1911 Act limited the Lords' power to delay money bills to just one month and other public bills to two years. The 1949 Act further reduced the delaying power for non-money bills to one year. These acts essentially established the supremacy of the Commons. So, while the Lords can debate and propose amendments, the Commons can ultimately override their objections. This ensures that the will of the elected representatives of the people prevails, making "Yes, always" the correct answer. The other options are incorrect because they don't reflect the current constitutional reality where the Commons has the final say.
