The House of Lords, unlike the House of Commons, isn't directly elected by the public. Its composition is rooted in historical tradition and appointment. Think of it this way: the House of Commons is the voice of the people, directly chosen through elections. The Lords, on the other hand, have traditionally been made up of hereditary peers (those who inherit their titles), life peers (appointed for their expertise and contributions to society), and bishops of the Church of England. While reforms have reduced the number of hereditary peers, the fundamental principle remains: members aren't elected. So, while it might seem logical to assume all parts of Parliament are democratically elected, the House of Lords operates on a different system based on historical precedent and specific roles. The idea is that they bring different perspectives and expertise to the legislative process, acting as a check and balance on the elected House of Commons.
