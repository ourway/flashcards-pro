National days are typically secular and commemorate events of national significance, uniting people regardless of their faith. Think of days like national independence days or days of remembrance tied to a country's history. Eid ul-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan in Islam, and Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, are primarily religious observances. While they are widely celebrated and hold immense cultural importance for many in the UK, recognizing them as national days would inherently favor specific religious groups. This could potentially exclude or marginalize individuals of other faiths or no faith, which goes against the principle of national days being inclusive and representative of the entire population. So, while these festivals are vibrant parts of the UK's multicultural landscape, they don't fit the criteria for national days.
