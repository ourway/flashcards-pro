April Fool's Day, observed every year on April 1st, is a tradition celebrated in the UK and many other countries where people play practical jokes and hoaxes on each other. The origins of April Fool's Day are a bit murky, but one popular theory links it to the shift from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century. Some suggest that people who were slow to get the news or failed to recognize that New Year's Day had moved to January 1st continued to celebrate it on April 1st and were then mocked as "April fools." While the exact history is debated, the tradition of playing pranks on this day is well-established in British culture. So, if you hear a ridiculous story on April 1st, be wary â€“ it's likely an April Fool's joke! That's why the statement is true; April Fool's Day, with all its playful trickery, definitely falls on April 1st in the UK.
