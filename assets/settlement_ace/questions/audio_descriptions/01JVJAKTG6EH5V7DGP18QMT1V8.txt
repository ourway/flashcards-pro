In the 19th century, the prevailing economic philosophy was increasingly focused on the idea of free trade. Think of it as a reaction against earlier systems where governments heavily controlled trade through tariffs and other restrictions. The core idea behind free trade is that economies benefit when goods and services can move between countries without artificial barriers. Now, how do you actually *achieve* free trade? The most direct way is to get rid of those barriers! Taxes on imported goods, also known as tariffs or customs duties, make those goods more expensive, discouraging people from buying them. By removing these taxes, imported goods become cheaper and more competitive, boosting trade between countries. Subsidizing each trade would be incredibly expensive and impractical. Building airports, while important for infrastructure, is more about facilitating transportation generally, not specifically about trade policy. And introducing a stock market is about investment and company ownership, not directly about the flow of goods across borders. So, removing import taxes was the key method used to promote free trade during that era.
