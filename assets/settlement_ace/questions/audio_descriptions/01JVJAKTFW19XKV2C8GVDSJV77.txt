Okay, so 10 Downing Street is basically the official residence and the workplace of the British Prime Minister. Think of it as the UK's equivalent to the White House in the United States. It's been the Prime Minister's official home since 1735, when Sir Robert Walpole, often considered the first Prime Minister, was gifted the house by King George II. While the Queen is the Head of State and resides at Buckingham Palace, and the President has no role in the UK government, the Prime Minister is the head of the UK government. So, while other answers might seem plausible, 10 Downing Street is specifically tied to the office of the Prime Minister. It's not just a house; it's a symbol of British political power and leadership. Plus, it's where the Cabinet meets!
