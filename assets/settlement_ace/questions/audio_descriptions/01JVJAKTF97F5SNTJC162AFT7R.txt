The concept of good citizenship is central to the values upheld in the UK. Think of it as everyone playing their part to make society better. This includes things like obeying the law, of course, but it goes beyond that. It's about contributing to your community, perhaps through volunteering, paying taxes which fund public services like healthcare and education, or even just being a good neighbour. A society thrives when its members actively participate and contribute positively. The UK, with its long history of civic engagement and community spirit, relies on the active participation of its residents. Therefore, the statement is true because a society benefits from the positive actions of its citizens. While some might think that simply not breaking the law is enough, the ideal of good citizenship involves actively making a positive impact.
