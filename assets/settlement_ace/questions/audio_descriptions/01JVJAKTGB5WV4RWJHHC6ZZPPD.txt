The Battle of Bannockburn, fought in 1314, is a pivotal moment in Scottish history. It represents a major turning point in the First War of Scottish Independence against England. For years, the English had exerted control over Scotland, but the Scots, under a strong leader, were determined to regain their freedom. That leader was Robert the Bruce. He had claimed the Scottish throne in 1306 and spent years fighting to secure it. Bannockburn was a decisive battle where Robert the Bruce, commanding the Scottish army, achieved a stunning victory against the larger English forces led by King Edward II. This victory significantly weakened English claims to Scotland and helped pave the way for Scottish independence. While James VI was a later Scottish king who also became King of England, Kenneth MacAlpin is considered the first King of Scots, and Alfred the Great was an Anglo-Saxon king, none of them were involved in the Battle of Bannockburn. Robert the Bruce's leadership at Bannockburn solidified his place as a national hero in Scotland.
