Alright, let's delve into England's medieval military adventures abroad. The Middle Ages, roughly from the 5th to the 15th century, saw English kings and knights involved in conflicts far beyond their own borders. The Hundred Years' War, spanning from 1337 to 1453, was a series of conflicts between England and France for control of the French throne. English armies repeatedly invaded France, achieving notable victories like the Battle of Agincourt. Simultaneously, the Crusades, a series of religious wars between the 11th and 13th centuries, saw European Christians, including many English knights and soldiers, journey to the Middle East to fight for control of the Holy Land. These were major, sustained military efforts on foreign soil. Now, the War of the Roses was a purely internal English conflict, a bloody civil war between the Houses of Lancaster and York fighting for the English throne. The Battle of Hastings, while hugely significant, was fought on English soil in 1066, marking the Norman conquest *of* England, not English forces fighting abroad. So, the Hundred Years' War and the Crusades are the two major medieval conflicts that clearly involved English forces fighting on foreign lands.
