Local councils are the backbone of community services in the UK, responsible for everything from schools and libraries to waste collection and road maintenance. To keep these vital services running, councils need a steady source of income. While bake sales and donations might help a local charity, they simply aren't enough to fund the large-scale operations of a council. The two main sources of funding are grants from central government and local taxes, primarily the Council Tax. Central government allocates funds to councils based on factors like population size and the needs of the local area. Council Tax is a tax paid by residents based on the value of their property. This combination ensures that councils have a reliable income stream, balancing national support with local contributions. So, while local fundraising or business contributions might play a small role, the bulk of council funding comes from these two key sources.
