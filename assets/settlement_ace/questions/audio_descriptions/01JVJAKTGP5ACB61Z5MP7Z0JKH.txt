The fight for women's suffrage in Britain was a long and arduous one, spanning decades. While some women, specifically those over 30 who met certain property qualifications, gained the right to vote in 1918, this wasn't full equality. Think about the social context of the time - World War I had just ended, and women had played a crucial role in keeping the country running while men were at war. This contribution significantly shifted public opinion. However, the 1918 act was a compromise. It wasn't until ten years later, in 1928, that the Representation of the People Act finally granted women the right to vote on the same terms as men, meaning at the age of 21. This was a monumental achievement, solidifying women's place in British democracy and ensuring equal participation in the electoral process. So, while 1918 was a step, 1928 is the year to remember for equal voting rights.
