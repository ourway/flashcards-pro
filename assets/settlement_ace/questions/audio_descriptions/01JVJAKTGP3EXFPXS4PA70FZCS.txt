Okay, let's break down why it's false that everyone in England, Wales, and Scotland must fill in an individual electoral registration form, also known as 'Individual Registration'. The key here is understanding the different registration systems across the UK. Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) uses a system where individuals are responsible for registering themselves to vote. This is called Individual Electoral Registration (IER), and it's been in place since 2014. However, Northern Ireland has a different system due to its unique political history and the need to prevent electoral fraud. In Northern Ireland, every household receives a form, and each person must provide specific information, including proof of identity, to be registered. So, while Individual Electoral Registration exists across Great Britain, the specific requirement of filling out a form sent to every household applies only to Northern Ireland. It's easy to get confused because the concept of individual registration is present throughout the UK, but the mandatory form sent to every household is specific to Northern Ireland.
