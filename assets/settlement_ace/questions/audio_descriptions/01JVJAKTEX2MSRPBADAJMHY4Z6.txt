Okay, let's talk about the UK's population around the turn of the 20th century. The year 1901 falls squarely within the Victorian era, a time of significant industrial growth and urban expansion. Think of the Industrial Revolution â€“ factories booming, cities growing rapidly as people moved from rural areas seeking work. This period saw a massive population increase, but it hadn't yet reached the levels we see today. Now, while 50 or 60 million might seem plausible if you're thinking of the modern UK, those numbers are too high for 1901. Similarly, 27 million is too low, reflecting a time before the major population boom. The correct figure, around 40 million, reflects the substantial growth of the Victorian era without overstating it. It's a good benchmark to remember when considering the UK's historical demographic trends.
