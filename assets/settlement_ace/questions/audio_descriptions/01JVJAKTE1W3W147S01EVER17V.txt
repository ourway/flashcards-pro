Civil law deals with disputes between individuals or organisations, focusing on protecting their rights and providing remedies when those rights are violated. Think of it as the set of rules that govern our everyday interactions and relationships. Now, consider the workplace. Everyone has the right to be treated fairly and equally, regardless of their background. When someone faces discrimination at work – perhaps they're unfairly passed over for a promotion or experience harassment – that's a violation of their civil rights. They can then pursue legal action under civil law to seek compensation or other remedies. On the other hand, selling tobacco or alcohol to minors, or carrying weapons, are all actions that the government has deemed harmful to society as a whole. These are considered crimes and fall under criminal law, where the state prosecutes the offender. So, while those actions are definitely illegal, they aren't examples of civil law in action.
