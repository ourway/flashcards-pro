The year 1776 is hugely significant because it marks the start of the United States of America. Back then, what we now know as the USA was a collection of thirteen colonies ruled by Great Britain. Over time, tensions grew due to issues like taxation without representation â€“ the colonists felt they were being unfairly taxed by the British government without having any say in Parliament. This led to increasing unrest and eventually, a declaration of independence. On July 4th, 1776, these American colonies formally declared their independence from British rule, an event celebrated annually as Independence Day in the United States. So, when you hear about colonies declaring independence in 1776, it's specifically referring to the American colonies. While Australia, Canada, and South Africa were also part of the British Empire at different times, they gained their independence much later and through different processes.
