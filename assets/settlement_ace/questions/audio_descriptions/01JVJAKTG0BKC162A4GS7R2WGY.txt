Okay, let's talk about the UK's national parks. These aren't just pretty places; they're legally protected areas designated for their natural beauty, wildlife, and cultural heritage. The idea of national parks came about in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, inspired by the national park movement in the United States. After a lot of debate, the first national parks in the UK were established in 1951. Now, while there are many beautiful areas in the UK, only fifteen have been officially designated as national parks. England has ten, including the Lake District and the Peak District. Wales boasts three, such as Snowdonia, known for its challenging climbs. And Scotland, famous for its rugged landscapes, has two, including the Cairngorms. So, when you add them all up – ten in England, three in Wales, and two in Scotland – you get a total of fifteen national parks spread across the UK. It's easy to overestimate the number because there are so many stunning landscapes, but the official count is fifteen.
