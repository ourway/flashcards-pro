New Year's Day, celebrated on the 1st of January, marks the start of the Gregorian calendar year, which is the most widely used calendar system globally, including in the UK. Its roots trace back to ancient Roman times, with January named after Janus, the Roman god of beginnings and transitions. While different cultures and religions have their own New Year celebrations at various times of the year, the 1st of January is the official public holiday in the UK. It's a time for resolutions, celebrations, and looking forward to the year ahead. While some might think of New Year's Eve on December 31st, that's the night *before* the new year begins. The 7th of January is sometimes mistakenly associated with the Julian calendar used by some Orthodox Christian churches, and the 1st of February has no connection to New Year celebrations in the UK. So, when the clock strikes midnight on December 31st, we officially enter the 1st of January, New Year's Day.
