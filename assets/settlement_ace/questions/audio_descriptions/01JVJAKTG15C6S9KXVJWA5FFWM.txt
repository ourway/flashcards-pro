The Northern Ireland Assembly, established as part of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, operates on the principle of devolved powers. Devolution means that certain powers are transferred from the UK Parliament in Westminster to a regional assembly or parliament. In Northern Ireland's case, this includes significant control over many aspects of daily life. Think of it like this: while Westminster handles things like national defense and foreign policy, the Northern Ireland Assembly directly manages key public services. This includes shaping education policies, supporting the agricultural sector, implementing environmental regulations, overseeing healthcare provision, and managing social services. So, the Northern Ireland Assembly does indeed have authority over these issues, making the statement true. It's a core part of how Northern Ireland governs itself, ensuring decisions are made closer to the people they affect.
