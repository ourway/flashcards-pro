Okay, let's break down why agriculture and social services are the areas of governance decided upon by the Northern Ireland Assembly. To understand this, we need to remember the concept of "devolved powers." Devolution is when the central government grants some of its powers to regional assemblies or parliaments. The Northern Ireland Assembly, established as part of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, has authority over many areas of domestic policy. These include things like healthcare, education, and, importantly, agriculture and social services. Think of it this way: these are the issues that directly impact the daily lives of people in Northern Ireland. Defence and foreign affairs, on the other hand, are typically reserved for the UK Parliament in Westminster. These are seen as matters of national security and international relations that need a unified approach across the entire United Kingdom. So, while the Northern Ireland Assembly handles local matters, the UK government handles the big picture issues.
