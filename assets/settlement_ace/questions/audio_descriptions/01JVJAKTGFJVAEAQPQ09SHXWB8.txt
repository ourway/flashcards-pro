Okay, let's talk about the power dynamic between the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Think of the UK Parliament as having two chambers, like a double-check system for laws. The House of Commons is made up of elected Members of Parliament, who represent specific areas of the country. Because they're directly elected by the people, they're seen as having a stronger mandate to make decisions. Now, the House of Lords is different. It includes appointed members, like life peers, and hereditary peers. Historically, the Lords held significant power, but over time, especially with the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949, their ability to block legislation passed by the Commons was greatly reduced. These acts were crucial in establishing the supremacy of the Commons. Today, the Lords can debate, suggest amendments, and delay bills, but they can't ultimately veto laws approved by the Commons. So, while the House of Lords plays an important role in scrutinizing legislation, the House of Commons definitely wields more power because it has the final say on laws and government policy.
