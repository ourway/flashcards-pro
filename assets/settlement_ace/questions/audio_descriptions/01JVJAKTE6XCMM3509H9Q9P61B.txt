The First World War, a global conflict that reshaped the world, officially ended with the signing of the Armistice. This Armistice was an agreement between the Allies and Germany to stop fighting. It was signed in a railway carriage in Compiègne, France. The agreement specifically stipulated that hostilities would cease at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month – that's 11:00 am on November 11, 1918. This precise timing was chosen to allow news of the ceasefire to reach the front lines and for fighting to stop simultaneously. The date is now commemorated annually as Remembrance Day or Armistice Day in many countries, including the UK, with a two-minute silence observed at 11:00 am to remember those who died in the war. So, the statement is indeed accurate; the First World War did officially cease at that specific time and date.
