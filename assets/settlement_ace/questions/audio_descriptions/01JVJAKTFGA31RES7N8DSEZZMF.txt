Okay, let's break down the voting registration systems across the UK. It's easy to get them mixed up! Great Britain, which includes England, Wales, and Scotland, operates under a system of "household registration." This means one person in the household can register everyone who is eligible to vote at that address. Think of it as a form sent to the household, and one person fills it out for all eligible residents. However, Northern Ireland uses "individual electoral registration." This means that each person who is entitled to vote must complete their own registration form. This system was introduced in Northern Ireland to improve the accuracy of the electoral register and reduce the potential for fraud. So, the statement is false because it incorrectly attributes the individual registration system to Wales and Scotland, when it's actually used in Northern Ireland. Remembering that Great Britain uses household registration, while Northern Ireland uses individual registration, will help you avoid this common mistake.
