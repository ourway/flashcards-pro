The Reformation was a really pivotal moment in European history, shaking up the religious landscape in the 16th century. Before this, the Catholic Church held significant power and influence. However, concerns grew about certain practices and doctrines. Figures like Martin Luther in Germany and John Calvin in Switzerland began to voice their criticisms, arguing for reforms based on their interpretations of the Bible. This movement, fueled by a desire to 'protest' against perceived errors within the Catholic Church, led to the emergence of Protestantism. So, Protestantism didn't exist *before* the Reformation; it was a direct *result* of it. While Catholicism predates the Reformation by centuries, and other denominations like Methodism came later, Protestantism was born from this specific period of religious upheaval and reform. Hinduism, of course, is a completely different religion with origins in the Indian subcontinent.
