Remembrance Day, observed annually on November 11th, is a profoundly significant day in the UK dedicated to remembering and honoring those who have died in service to the country. Its origins lie in the aftermath of World War I, specifically the armistice signed at 11 am on the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, effectively ending the war. The day evolved to commemorate not only those who died in the First World War but also those who have served and died in subsequent conflicts. The poppy, a powerful symbol of remembrance, became associated with the day due to the poppies that grew on the battlefields of Flanders. While the focus is primarily on British and Commonwealth soldiers, Remembrance Day also acknowledges the sacrifices made by allies who fought alongside the UK in various wars. Therefore, it's true that Remembrance Day commemorates those who died fighting for the UK and its allies.
