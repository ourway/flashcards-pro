Okay, so Henry VIII's marital problems are a pretty big deal in British history, and they're all tied to the Pope. Back in the 16th century, England was a Catholic country, and the Pope, based in Rome, was the head of the Catholic Church. This meant he had the final say on religious matters, including marriage and divorce. Henry wanted to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, because she hadn't produced a male heir, and he wanted to marry Anne Boleyn. However, divorce wasn't really a thing in the Catholic Church unless the Pope granted an annulment, which is basically declaring the marriage invalid from the start. Henry asked the Pope for an annulment, but the Pope refused, partly because Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, who had a lot of influence over the Pope. This refusal led Henry to break away from the Catholic Church altogether and establish the Church of England, with himself as the head. This allowed him to grant himself a divorce. So, the Pope's refusal is the key event that triggered the English Reformation. While a Bishop or Priest might handle local religious matters, and a Judge handles legal matters, only the Pope had the authority to grant Henry the annulment he needed.
