The Wars of the Roses, a tumultuous period in English history during the 15th century, was essentially a power struggle for the English throne. Think of it as a massive family feud, but with armies and battles! The two families vying for control were the House of York and the House of Lancaster. These weren't just random names; they were powerful noble families who both believed they had a legitimate claim to the throne. The conflict got its flowery name much later, but it's a helpful image: the white rose represented the House of York, and the red rose symbolized the House of Lancaster. The battles raged on and off for over 30 years, involving key figures like Richard of York and Henry VI. Ultimately, the Wars of the Roses ended with Henry Tudor, who had Lancastrian connections, defeating Richard III of York and establishing the Tudor dynasty. So, when you think of the Wars of the Roses, remember those two warring families, symbolized by their respective roses, battling for the crown.
