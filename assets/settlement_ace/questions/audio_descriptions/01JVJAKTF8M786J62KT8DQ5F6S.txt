The United Nations Security Council is a crucial body within the UN, responsible for maintaining international peace and security. Think of it as the UN's rapid response team for global crises. It's not a huge assembly like the General Assembly, but a smaller, more agile group. The Security Council has 15 members in total. Five of these are permanent members: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These permanent members have the power of veto, meaning they can block any resolution. The other 10 members are elected by the General Assembly for two-year terms. So, while the UN has many member states – far more than 150 – the Security Council, the body tasked with immediate action on global security threats, is specifically composed of these 15 nations. Remembering that the Security Council is a smaller, focused group is key to avoiding confusion with the larger UN membership.
