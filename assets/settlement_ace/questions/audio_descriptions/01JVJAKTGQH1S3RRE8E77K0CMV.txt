Okay, let's talk about tobacco sales in the UK. It's illegal to sell tobacco products to just anyone, regardless of age. The key here is understanding the age restrictions that are in place to protect young people. The UK has strict laws about who can buy tobacco because of the serious health risks associated with smoking, like lung cancer and heart disease. These laws are in place to reduce the number of people who start smoking, particularly young people who might not fully understand the long-term consequences. Currently, the legal age to purchase tobacco in the UK is 18. So, selling tobacco to someone younger than 18 is against the law. It's a measure to safeguard public health and prevent underage smoking. Some might think it's legal for everyone, but that's simply not the case due to these important age restrictions.
