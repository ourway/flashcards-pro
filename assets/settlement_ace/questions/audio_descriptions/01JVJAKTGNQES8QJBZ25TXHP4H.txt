Cardiff is the capital city of Wales, and it's where you'll find the Senedd, which is the Welsh Parliament, also known as the National Assembly for Wales. Think of it like this: London houses the UK Parliament, and Cardiff houses the Welsh Parliament. The Senedd is responsible for making laws specifically for Wales on devolved matters like education, health, and the environment. It was established in 1999 following a referendum, giving Wales greater control over its own affairs. While Newport is a significant city in Wales and Glasgow is a major Scottish city, neither of them are the capital, nor do they house the Welsh Parliament. So, if you're looking for the heart of Welsh governance, you'll find it beating in Cardiff.
