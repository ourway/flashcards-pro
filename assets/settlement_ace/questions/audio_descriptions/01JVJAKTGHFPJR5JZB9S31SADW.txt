The Grand National is a world-famous steeplechase, a type of horse race where horses jump over various obstacles. It's a really big deal in the UK, attracting huge crowds and TV audiences. The key thing to remember is that this race isn't just anywhere; it has a specific home. That home is Aintree Racecourse, and Aintree is located very close to Liverpool. So, while you might think of other famous cities in the UK, the Grand National is synonymous with the Liverpool area. It's been held there since 1839, becoming a staple of British sporting culture. While Manchester is another large city in the North West, and London is the capital, neither of them host this particular event. And Suffolk, being a county in the East of England, is geographically quite far from the racecourse. Therefore, "Near Liverpool" is the only answer that accurately reflects the location of the Grand National.
