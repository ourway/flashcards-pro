The Crimean War, fought from 1854 to 1856, was a conflict rooted in the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the expansionist ambitions of Russia. Russia sought greater influence over the Ottoman territories, particularly access to the Black Sea and protection of Orthodox Christians within the Ottoman Empire. Britain and France, wary of Russia's growing power and keen to protect their own strategic and economic interests in the region, allied with the Ottoman Empire to oppose Russia. So, while the Ottoman Empire (Turkey) was involved, they were actually Britain's ally in this conflict. Germany, as a unified nation, didn't exist yet during the Crimean War, and France was on the same side as Britain. Therefore, the main opponent that Britain fought against in the Crimean War was Russia, making it the correct answer. The war itself, though relatively short, was known for its poor leadership and logistical failures, but also for the heroic nursing work of Florence Nightingale.
