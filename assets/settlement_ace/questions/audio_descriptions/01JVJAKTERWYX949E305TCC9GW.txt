The role of Magistrates and Justices of the Peace in the UK's legal system is deeply rooted in the concept of civic duty and community service. Historically, these positions were filled by respected members of the local community, often landowners or business owners, who were trusted to administer justice fairly. This tradition continues today. While they handle a significant number of cases, particularly in the lower courts, they are not legally required to have formal legal qualifications. Instead, they receive training to equip them with the necessary knowledge of the law and court procedures. The fact that they work unpaid reflects this commitment to public service, distinguishing them from professional judges who are salaried. This system helps to ensure that justice is accessible and administered by people who understand the local context, rather than being solely the domain of legal professionals. It's a unique aspect of the UK legal system, emphasizing community involvement in the administration of justice.
