The Huguenots were French Protestants who faced severe persecution in France, particularly during the 16th and 17th centuries. The Edict of Nantes in 1598 had granted them some religious freedoms, but this was revoked in 1685 by Louis XIV with the Edict of Fontainebleau. This revocation led to a mass exodus of Huguenots from France. Many sought refuge in Protestant countries, and England was a popular destination due to its relative religious tolerance and proximity. Significant numbers of Huguenots arrived in England before 1720, establishing communities and contributing significantly to industries like weaving and watchmaking. The other options, Welsh and Bretons, are incorrect because they are Celtic groups indigenous to Britain and France respectively, not refugees seeking asylum. Germans, while they have migrated to Britain at various times, did not arrive as a significant refugee group before 1720 in the same way as the Huguenots fleeing religious persecution.
