Bobby Moore is practically synonymous with English football. To understand why, you have to go back to 1966.

This was, and remains, England's only World Cup win, cementing Moore's place as a national hero. He was known for his exceptional defensive skills and leadership qualities. While rugby union, horse racing, and motor racing are all popular sports in the UK, none are directly linked to Bobby Moore's legacy. His entire career was dedicated to football, and his achievements in that sport are what made him a household name. So, when you think of Bobby Moore, think of the iconic image of him lifting the World Cup trophy â€“ a moment forever etched in English football history.
