William Wordsworth is your go-to poet when thinking about nature's influence on literature. He was a central figure in the Romantic movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a period that really emphasized emotion, imagination, and, crucially, the beauty and power of the natural world. Wordsworth, born in the Lake District, found immense inspiration in the landscapes around him. His most famous works, like "Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey" and "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud" (also known as "Daffodils"), directly reflect his deep connection with nature and its impact on his emotions and thoughts. He saw nature as a source of spiritual and moral guidance, a theme that runs throughout his poetry. While John Masefield, Wilfred Owen, and Siegfried Sassoon are all significant poets, their work focuses on different themes. Masefield wrote about the sea, while Owen and Sassoon are known for their war poetry, particularly their experiences in World War I. So, when you think of a poet deeply inspired by nature, Wordsworth should immediately come to mind.
