The English language we speak today is a fascinating blend of different influences, primarily stemming from the Anglo-Saxon and Norman French languages. After the Roman withdrawal in the 5th century, various Germanic tribes, including the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, migrated to Britain. Their dialects, collectively known as Anglo-Saxon or Old English, formed the foundation of the language. Then, in 1066, the Norman Conquest occurred, with William the Conqueror and his Norman French-speaking forces taking control of England. Over the next few centuries, Norman French became the language of the ruling class, law, and administration. Gradually, Anglo-Saxon and Norman French began to mix. Words from Norman French were adopted into the Anglo-Saxon vocabulary, enriching it and leading to the development of Middle English, the ancestor of modern English. So, while Latin and Proto-Celtic certainly had some influence on the development of languages spoken in Britain, they weren't the two primary languages that directly merged to create the English language we know today.
