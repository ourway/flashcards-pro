Okay, let's talk about Good Friday. To understand why it's the day that commemorates Jesus Christ's death, we need a bit of background on the Christian faith. Christians believe that Jesus, the son of God, was crucified on a Friday as a sacrifice for humanity's sins. This event is central to their beliefs about salvation and redemption. Now, the term "Good Friday" might seem odd, considering it marks a somber occasion. There are a few theories about its origin, but one suggests "good" meant "holy." Regardless, it's a day of mourning and reflection for Christians worldwide. Easter Sunday, on the other hand, celebrates the resurrection of Jesus, his rising from the dead, which occurred two days after his crucifixion. Easter Monday is simply the day after Easter Sunday and doesn't directly relate to the crucifixion itself. Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent, a period of fasting and repentance leading up to Easter, so it's also not the correct answer. Therefore, Good Friday is specifically the day set aside to remember and commemorate the crucifixion, making it the correct choice.
