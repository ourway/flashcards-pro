The Viking Age, roughly from the late 8th to the mid-11th century, saw Norse seafarers expanding their influence across Europe and beyond. When we talk about the Vikings' geographical origins, we're really focusing on Scandinavia. While Sweden was certainly part of the Viking world, the primary launchpads for Viking raids and explorations were Norway and Denmark. Think of the longships setting sail from the fjords of Norway and the coasts of Denmark. These regions provided the ideal conditions for seafaring: access to the sea, shipbuilding resources like timber, and a warrior culture that encouraged exploration and conquest. While Vikings did eventually settle in areas like parts of modern-day England, France, and even Russia, their homelands remained in Norway and Denmark. So, while Norway and Sweden are both Scandinavian countries with Viking heritage, the initial and most significant Viking expeditions originated from Norway and Denmark.
