Jane Austen is one of England's most beloved novelists, famous for her witty social commentary and insightful portrayals of English middle-class life during the Regency era, roughly from 1811 to 1820. Her novels often explore themes of love, marriage, and social mobility. "Sense and Sensibility," published in 1811, was actually her first published novel, although it was initially released anonymously. The story follows the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, as they navigate love and societal expectations with contrasting approaches â€“ Elinor representing "sense" and Marianne "sensibility." The other options belong to different authors and time periods. Thomas Hardy wrote "Far from the Madding Crowd" much later in the Victorian era, while Charles Dickens penned "Oliver Twist," also during the Victorian period, focusing on social reform. Graham Greene's "Our Man in Havana" is a 20th-century work, making "Sense and Sensibility" the only novel on the list penned by Jane Austen.
