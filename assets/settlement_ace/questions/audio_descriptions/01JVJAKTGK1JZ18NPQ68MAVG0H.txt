Civil servants in the UK form the backbone of the government's administrative system, and their political neutrality is absolutely essential for a functioning democracy. Think of it this way: governments come and go, changing with elections, but the civil service remains constant. Their job is to implement the policies of the *current* government, whoever that may be. If civil servants were politically aligned, it could lead to bias in how policies are implemented, potentially favoring one political party over another. This would undermine fairness and public trust. The principle of neutrality ensures that everyone is treated equally, regardless of their political views. It also means that civil servants can offer impartial advice to ministers, based on evidence and expertise, rather than political considerations. So, while it might seem tempting to think they should align with the elected government, their strength lies in serving the public impartially, offering continuity and expertise across different administrations.
