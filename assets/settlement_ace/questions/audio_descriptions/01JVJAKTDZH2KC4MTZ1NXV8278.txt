Golf's story begins way back in Scotland during the 15th century. Picture the Scottish Highlands, with their vast, grassy landscapes – perfect for hitting a ball around! While the exact origins are a bit hazy, most historians agree that a game resembling modern golf was played near the eastern coast of Scotland. King James II even tried to ban it for a while because it was distracting people from archery practice, which was essential for national defence. The game really took off in the 18th century, with the establishment of famous clubs like the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, which is still considered the "home of golf" today. So, when you think of golf, think of Scotland – its rolling hills, its history, and its enduring love for this challenging and strategic sport. The other options, surfing, cricket and motorbike racing, are all popular sports, but they have different origins, with surfing linked to Hawaii, cricket to England, and motorbike racing developing with the invention of the motorcycle.
