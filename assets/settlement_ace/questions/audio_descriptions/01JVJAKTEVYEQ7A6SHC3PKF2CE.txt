Alright, let's talk about invasions! When we think about the last successful invasion of England, we're going way back to 1066. This is a pivotal year in English history because it marks the Norman Conquest. William, Duke of Normandy, crossed the English Channel with his army and defeated King Harold at the Battle of Hastings. This wasn't just a change of leadership; it fundamentally altered English society, language, law, and culture. The Norman Conquest brought a new aristocracy, a new legal system based on feudalism, and heavily influenced the English language with French vocabulary. While England faced threats and attempted invasions later on, none were successful in actually conquering the country. So, while 1415 might make you think of the Battle of Agincourt in the Hundred Years' War, or 1642 the start of the English Civil War, and 1940 the Battle of Britain, none of those events involved a successful foreign invasion and takeover. 1066 and the Norman Conquest remain the last time England was successfully invaded and its ruling class replaced.
