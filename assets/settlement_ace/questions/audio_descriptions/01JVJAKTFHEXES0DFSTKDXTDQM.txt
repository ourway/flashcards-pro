Okay, let's explore the origins of the British Parliament. While early forms of councils and advisors existed long before, the Middle Ages, roughly from the 11th to the 15th centuries, were crucial for Parliament's development. Think back to the Magna Carta in 1215. This was a pivotal moment where barons limited the king's power and established the principle that even the monarch was subject to the law. Over time, these gatherings of nobles and clergy evolved into a more structured body. By the late 13th century, under Edward I, we see the beginnings of a representative Parliament, including elected representatives from shires and towns. This is when the House of Commons started to take shape alongside the House of Lords. So, while other periods brought changes to Parliament, its fundamental structure and role as a law-making body really took root during the Middle Ages. The other options are incorrect because the Bronze and Iron Ages were far too early for such a complex institution, and the Industrial Revolution was a period of social and economic change, but not the foundational development of Parliament itself.
