The history of Britain is marked by several invasions, each leaving its own imprint on the culture and language. The Romans, Anglo-Saxons, and Vikings all made significant impacts, but the *last* successful invasion was the Norman Conquest in 1066. Led by William, Duke of Normandy, the Norman army defeated King Harold at the Battle of Hastings. This victory was decisive, leading to Norman rule over England. While the Vikings raided and settled parts of Britain for centuries, and the Anglo-Saxons established kingdoms after the Roman withdrawal, the Norman Conquest is chronologically the most recent successful invasion that resulted in a change of ruling power. The Norman Conquest brought about significant changes in English law, language, and architecture, shaping much of what we recognise as modern Britain. So, while the other invasions were indeed important, they happened earlier in history.
