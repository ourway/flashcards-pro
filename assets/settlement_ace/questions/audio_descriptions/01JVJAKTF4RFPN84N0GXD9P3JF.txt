William Shakespeare, a towering figure in English literature, lived from 1564 to 1616, during the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras. He's celebrated for his dramatic works and poetic verses, not for modern media formats that didn't exist in his time. Shakespeare's plays, like "Hamlet," "Romeo and Juliet," and "Macbeth," are staples of English literature, studied and performed worldwide. His sonnets, numbering 154, are also highly regarded for their exploration of love, beauty, and time. While television dramas and radio scripts are forms of storytelling, they are much more recent inventions. Shakespeare's genius lies in his mastery of language and his ability to capture universal human experiences through the written word, specifically through plays meant for the stage and poems intended to be read and recited.
