Okay, let's delve into the era of Oliver Cromwell and the unique title of Lord Protector. Following the English Civil War in the mid-17th century, King Charles I was executed in 1649, and England became a republic, known as the Commonwealth. However, this republic wasn't stable. Oliver Cromwell, a military leader who played a key role in the Parliamentarian victory, eventually dissolved the Parliament and established a new form of government called the Protectorate in 1653. He took on the title of Lord Protector, essentially becoming the head of state. This wasn't a monarchy, but it concentrated a lot of power in Cromwell's hands. He ruled until his death in 1658. His son briefly succeeded him, but the Protectorate collapsed, and the monarchy was restored with Charles II in 1660. So, while figures like Sir Francis Drake and Admiral Nelson were important naval heroes, and Charles II was a king, only Oliver Cromwell held the specific title of Lord Protector during that brief, turbulent period in British history.
