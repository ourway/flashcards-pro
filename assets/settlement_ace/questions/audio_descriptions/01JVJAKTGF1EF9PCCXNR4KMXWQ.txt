In the UK, the age of 18 is a significant milestone, marking the transition into adulthood with various rights and responsibilities. This is the age when you can vote in elections, enter into contracts, and, importantly, be summoned for jury duty. The legal system relies on juries made up of ordinary citizens to ensure fair trials. Being on a jury is considered a civic duty, a way for citizens to participate directly in the administration of justice. While 18-year-olds might not have extensive life experience, the legal system believes they are mature enough to understand evidence and contribute to a fair verdict. The other ages listed, 21, 25, and 30, are all ages where you are certainly eligible, but the minimum age is 18. So, while someone who is 25 could be summoned, the youngest age someone can be summoned is 18.
