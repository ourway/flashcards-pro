Okay, so let's talk about Charles II and the Restoration. After the execution of Charles I in 1649, England became a republic under Oliver Cromwell. However, this period of republican rule, known as the Commonwealth, didn't last. After Cromwell's death, there was political instability and a general desire to return to a more traditional form of government. People were tired of the strict Puritan rule. So, in 1660, Parliament invited Charles II, the son of the executed Charles I, to return from exile in the Netherlands and take the throne. This event is known as the Restoration, marking the return of the monarchy. Charles II's return was met with great enthusiasm, and he was crowned King of England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland in May 1660. So, the statement is true because Parliament was indeed successful in bringing Charles II back to be king.
