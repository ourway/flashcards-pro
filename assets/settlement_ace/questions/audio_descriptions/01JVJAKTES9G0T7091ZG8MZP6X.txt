The jury system in the UK is a cornerstone of its legal system, designed to ensure fairness and impartiality. The idea is that your fate is decided by a group of your peers, ordinary citizens, rather than solely by a judge or the government. To achieve this, juries are composed of individuals randomly selected from the electoral register, which lists all eligible voters in the country. This random selection aims to create a jury that represents a cross-section of society, reflecting diverse backgrounds and perspectives. This is why the correct answer is people randomly chosen from the electoral register. It wouldn't be fair or representative if only people in high-powered jobs, political party members, or those who applied could be on a jury. The randomness is key to the integrity of the system, ensuring that no one can hand-pick a jury to be biased. Jury duty is a civic responsibility, and being on the electoral register makes you eligible to be called.
