The Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 is a pivotal moment in English history, marking the end of the Wars of the Roses and the beginning of the Tudor dynasty. These wars were a long and bloody struggle for the English throne between the House of Lancaster and the House of York. Richard III was the last Yorkist king, and his reign was relatively short, lasting only two years. He faced considerable opposition and suspicion, particularly regarding the disappearance of his nephews, the young princes in the Tower of London. The Battle of Bosworth Field saw Henry Tudor, representing the Lancastrian claim, challenge Richard for the crown. Richard's defeat and death on the battlefield effectively ended the Yorkist line's claim to the throne. Henry Tudor then became King Henry VII, marrying Elizabeth of York to unite the two houses and ushering in a new era for England. So, because Richard III died in this decisive battle that ended the Wars of the Roses and paved the way for the Tudors, the year 1485 is the only possible answer.
