Ulster fry is definitely a delicious breakfast, but it's all about Northern Ireland, not Wales. Think of "Ulster" as your key clue â€“ it's a historical province largely corresponding to Northern Ireland. This hearty meal typically includes fried bacon, sausages, eggs, soda bread, and potato bread. It's a staple in Northern Irish cuisine and a popular choice for a weekend breakfast or brunch. Now, Wales has its own amazing culinary traditions, like Welsh rarebit (a cheesy toast dish) and laverbread (made from seaweed), but Ulster fry just isn't one of them. So, while it might be tempting to think that all parts of the UK share the same traditional foods, regional dishes are very distinct. Remembering that Ulster is strongly linked to Northern Ireland will help you avoid this kind of trick question.
