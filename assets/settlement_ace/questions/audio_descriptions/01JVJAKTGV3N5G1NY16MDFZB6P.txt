April 1st is widely known as April Fools' Day, a day dedicated to lighthearted pranks and practical jokes. This tradition isn't unique to the UK; it's celebrated in many countries around the world. The origins of April Fools' Day are a bit murky, but some historians believe it may be linked to the shift to the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century. When France adopted the new calendar in 1564, those who were slow to get the news or failed to recognize that New Year's Day had moved from the end of March to January 1st were mocked and had jokes played on them. Over time, this evolved into the tradition of playing tricks on each other on April 1st. While horse racing, church attendance, and demonstrations in Trafalgar Square are all activities that occur in the UK, they aren't specifically associated with April 1st. So, if you hear someone shout "April Fool!" on that day, be sure to double-check what's happening around you!
