Okay, let's talk about "The Planets." This is a really famous orchestral suite, and it's easy to get the composer mixed up. The key thing to remember is that "The Planets" was written by Gustav Holst, not Sir Edward Elgar. Holst composed it between 1914 and 1916, and each movement is named after a planet and is meant to convey the astrological character associated with it. Think of "Mars, the Bringer of War," or "Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity." In fact, the tune from Holst's "Jupiter" is very well known in Britain because it was adapted into a popular hymn called "I Vow to Thee, My Country," which is often sung at Remembrance services and other national events. Now, Elgar was also a very important British composer, famous for works like the "Enigma Variations" and the "Pomp and Circumstance" marches, but "The Planets" just wasn't his style. So, while both were giants of British music, Holst is the one connected to this particular piece.
