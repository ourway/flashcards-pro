Okay, let's break down how the UK government is formed and why the Prime Minister chooses the Cabinet. In the UK's parliamentary system, after a general election, the leader of the party who can command the confidence of the House of Commons – usually the party with the majority of seats – becomes the Prime Minister. Think of it like the captain of a ship; they're in charge and need to assemble their crew. That "crew" is the Cabinet, a group of senior ministers who head up the major government departments like the Treasury, Home Office, and Foreign Office. The Prime Minister needs to select individuals they trust and who are competent to run these departments effectively. While the Monarch formally appoints them, this is done on the Prime Minister's advice. The people of the UK elect Members of Parliament, but not the Cabinet directly. The Speaker's role is to preside over debates in the House of Commons, not to appoint members of the Cabinet. So, the Prime Minister is the key figure in choosing who sits around the Cabinet table.
