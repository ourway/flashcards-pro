Okay, let's talk about what people did for work back in the 1700s. Before the 18th century, most people in Britain were involved in agriculture â€“ farming was the backbone of the economy. But the 18th century saw some huge changes that really shifted things around. This was the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, a period of major technological advancements. Think about things like the invention of the steam engine and new ways of producing goods. These inventions led to factories popping up, especially in areas with resources like coal and iron. So, while fishing and teaching existed, and the aircraft industry was centuries away, manufacturing became the major employment sector because of these new technologies and the rise of factories. This period laid the foundation for the modern economy we know today.
