Good Friday is a really important day in the Christian calendar, but the name can be confusing! It doesn't celebrate something happy in the traditional sense. Instead, it commemorates the day that Jesus Christ died by crucifixion. To understand why this is so significant, you need to know that Christians believe Jesus' death was a sacrifice to atone for the sins of humanity. It's a somber day, often marked by church services, prayer, and reflection. Now, you might be thinking about Easter Sunday, which *is* a celebration of Jesus' resurrection â€“ that's when Christians believe he rose from the dead. Christmas, of course, celebrates his birth. So, while all these events are central to the Christian faith, Good Friday specifically focuses on the remembrance of Jesus' death. It's a key part of the Easter story and a fundamental aspect of Christian belief.
