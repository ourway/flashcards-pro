Edinburgh has been the capital of Scotland since the 15th century, solidifying its position in 1437. Before that, Scone held the title, where Scottish monarchs were traditionally crowned. Edinburgh's selection wasn't just arbitrary; its strategic location and the presence of Edinburgh Castle, a formidable fortress perched atop an extinct volcano, made it a natural choice for a centre of power. The city also became a hub for intellectual and cultural life, especially during the Scottish Enlightenment in the 18th century, earning it the nickname "Athens of the North." While Glasgow is larger and known for its industrial heritage, and Aberdeen is significant for its oil industry, neither has ever held the formal status of Scotland's capital. Dundee, famous for jute, jam, and journalism, also lacks that historical significance as the seat of Scottish government. So, while those cities are important in their own right, Edinburgh's long-standing role as the political and cultural heart of Scotland makes it the definitive answer.
