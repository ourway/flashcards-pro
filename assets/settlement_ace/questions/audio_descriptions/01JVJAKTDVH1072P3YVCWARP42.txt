England's naval tradition really took off during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, in the late 16th century. Before this, England had a navy, but it wasn't the dominant force it would become. Sir Francis Drake was a key figure in transforming England into a major naval power. He was a skilled navigator, explorer, and privateer, meaning he was authorized by the Queen to raid enemy ships, primarily Spanish ones. Drake famously circumnavigated the globe between 1577 and 1580, demonstrating England's growing maritime capabilities. However, his most significant contribution was his role in defeating the Spanish Armada in 1588. This massive Spanish fleet aimed to invade England, but Drake's tactics and leadership, along with other English commanders, led to its defeat. This victory was a turning point, establishing England as a major naval power and laying the foundation for its future maritime dominance. While figures like Oliver Cromwell and King James were important in English history, they weren't primarily known for their naval contributions, and Shakespeare was a playwright, not a naval leader!
