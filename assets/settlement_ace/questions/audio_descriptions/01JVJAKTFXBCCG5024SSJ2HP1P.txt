Okay, so in the UK legal system, the roles of the jury and the judge are distinct. Think of the jury as fact-finders. Their main job is to listen to all the evidence presented during a trial and decide whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty based on that evidence. This is a crucial role, as it ensures that ordinary citizens are involved in the justice system. Now, once a jury has reached a guilty verdict, their job is essentially done. It then falls to the judge to determine the appropriate sentence. The judge will consider various factors, such as the severity of the crime, any mitigating circumstances, and sentencing guidelines set by Parliament. So, while the jury decides *if* someone is guilty, the judge decides *what happens next* in terms of punishment. It's a common misconception to think the jury also decides the sentence, perhaps influenced by what we see in movies, but in the UK, that's the judge's responsibility.
