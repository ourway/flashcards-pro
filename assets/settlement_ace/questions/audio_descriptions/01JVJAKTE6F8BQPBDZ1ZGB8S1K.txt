Devolution, the transfer of power from central government to regional administrations, is a key part of modern British political history. While there had been discussions and movements advocating for greater Scottish autonomy for decades, it wasn't until the late 20th century that real change began to take shape. A referendum in 1997 showed strong support in Scotland for the creation of a Scottish Parliament. Following this, the Scotland Act was passed in 1998, paving the way for the first elections to the new parliament. The Scottish Parliament officially convened for the first time in 1999. This marked a significant moment, giving Scotland greater control over areas like education, healthcare, and local government. So, while other dates might seem plausible, 1999 is the specific year the Scottish Parliament was actually formed and began its work.
