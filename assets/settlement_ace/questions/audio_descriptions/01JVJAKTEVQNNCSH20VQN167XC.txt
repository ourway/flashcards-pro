The English legal system, and those of Wales and Northern Ireland which are very similar, are structured in a hierarchy. Think of it like a pyramid, with the most serious cases at the top and the least serious at the bottom. Magistrates' Courts form the foundation of this system. They handle the vast majority of criminal cases, around 95% in fact! These are generally less serious offences, such as minor theft, traffic violations, or public disorder. Magistrates themselves are often not legally trained judges, but local people who have been appointed to the role. They sit as a panel, usually of three, and make decisions based on the evidence presented. More serious crimes, like murder or armed robbery, are passed up to the Crown Court, which deals with indictable offences and has a judge and jury. The High Court deals with civil cases and some very specific criminal matters. So, because Magistrates' Courts deal with the bulk of less serious criminal cases, that's the correct answer.
