Wimbledon is the only correct answer here because it's the globally recognized name of the prestigious tennis tournament held in South London. The tournament's history stretches back to 1877, making it the oldest tennis tournament in the world. It's played on grass courts, a surface now relatively rare in professional tennis, adding to its unique character. Think of the iconic images: the players dressed in white, the tradition of enjoying strawberries and cream, and the royal box. These are all synonymous with Wimbledon. While Kingston and Vauxhall are areas in South London, they aren't associated with any major tennis events. Lords, on the other hand, is famous, but for cricket, not tennis. So, when you think of tennis in South London, Wimbledon is the name that immediately springs to mind, and for good reason!
