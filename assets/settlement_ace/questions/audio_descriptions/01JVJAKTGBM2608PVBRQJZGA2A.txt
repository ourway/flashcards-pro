The War of the Roses, a series of bloody civil wars fought in England during the 15th century, was a power struggle for the English throne between two rival branches of the royal House of Plantagenet: the House of Lancaster and the House of York. Think of it as a family feud on a grand, national scale! Each house had a symbolic rose; Lancaster's was red, and York's was white. The fighting was fierce and went on, on and off, for over 30 years, from 1455 to 1487. While the House of York had some early successes, ultimately, the Lancastrian forces, led by Henry Tudor, triumphed at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Henry Tudor, who was a Lancastrian, defeated and killed Richard III of the House of York, effectively ending the war. Henry then became King Henry VII, and to unite the warring houses, he married Elizabeth of York, creating the Tudor dynasty and blending the red and white roses into the Tudor rose, a symbol of peace and unity. So, while the conflict was complex, the House of Lancaster emerged victorious in the end, paving the way for a new era in English history.
