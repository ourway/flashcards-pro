Cricket is a sport deeply ingrained in British culture, and its unique terminology often reflects the country's climate. The phrase "rain stopped play" is almost exclusively associated with cricket because the game relies heavily on specific pitch conditions. Unlike sports like football or rugby, where play can often continue in wet weather, even if it's a bit muddy, cricket is far more sensitive. A wet pitch can make the ball behave unpredictably, becoming dangerous for batsmen. Umpires have the authority to suspend play if they believe conditions are unsafe or unfair due to rain. This isn't just about comfort; it's about maintaining the integrity and fairness of the game. While rain can affect outdoor sports like rugby, football, and tennis, none of them have adopted the phrase "rain stopped play" as commonly or as culturally significantly as cricket has. So, while you might see a football match played in the rain, you're much more likely to hear "rain stopped play" at a cricket ground.
