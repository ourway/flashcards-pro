Okay, let's talk about the thistle and its connection to Scotland. The thistle has been a Scottish emblem for centuries, with its first confirmed use dating back to the 15th century. Legend has it that a sleeping Scottish army was saved from a surprise attack by Viking invaders when one of the Norsemen stepped on a thistle, causing him to cry out and alert the Scots. Whether that's entirely true or not, the story highlights the thistle's association with protection and resilience, qualities often attributed to the Scottish people. It became a royal symbol during the reign of James III in the late 1400s and has appeared on Scottish coinage and in heraldry ever since. So, while Northern Ireland has the shamrock, Wales the daffodil, and England the rose, the prickly but beautiful thistle is uniquely linked to Scotland's identity and history, making it the correct answer.
