Okay, let's explore Queen Elizabeth I's religious affiliation. To understand this, we need to remember the religious turmoil of the Tudor period. Before Elizabeth, her father, Henry VIII, broke away from the Catholic Church to form the Church of England, primarily so he could divorce Catherine of Aragon. He was initially succeeded by his son, Edward VI, who was also Protestant. However, Edward died young, and Mary I, a staunch Catholic, took the throne. Mary tried to reverse the English Reformation and restore Catholicism, earning her the nickname "Bloody Mary" for persecuting Protestants. When Elizabeth I became Queen in 1558, the country was religiously divided. Elizabeth, however, re-established the Church of England as the dominant religion. She was a Protestant, although a moderate one, seeking a middle ground to avoid further religious conflict. So, while Catholicism was a major force in England before and during the Tudor period, Elizabeth I herself was firmly Protestant, making that the correct answer.
