Okay, let's talk about the first coins in Britain. Coinage didn't just pop up overnight; it was a gradual process tied to technological and economic developments. The Iron Age in Britain roughly spanned from around 800 BC to the Roman invasion in 43 AD. During this period, ironworking became widespread, leading to stronger tools and, importantly, more sophisticated trade networks. Before coins, people bartered, but as societies grew, the need for a standardized medium of exchange became clear. While the very earliest forms of currency were things like iron bars, actual coins started appearing towards the later part of the Iron Age, influenced by contact with continental Europe, particularly the Celts who were already using coins. These early British coins were often made of bronze, silver, and even gold, but the Iron Age marks the *introduction* of this concept. The Stone Age was far too early for coinage, as people were focused on basic survival. The Middle Ages were much later, after the Roman period, and the term "Gold Age" isn't really a recognized historical period in British history. So, the Iron Age is the key period when the idea of using coins as currency first took root in Britain.
