The Enlightenment, an influential intellectual and cultural movement of the 17th and 18th centuries, emphasized reason and individualism rather than tradition. Think of it as a period where people started questioning established norms and seeking knowledge through logic and observation. This era profoundly impacted both science and politics. In science, the Enlightenment fostered a spirit of inquiry, leading to major breakthroughs in fields like physics, chemistry, and biology. Think of Isaac Newton and his laws of motion, or the development of the scientific method itself. Simultaneously, in politics, Enlightenment thinkers championed ideas like natural rights, separation of powers, and democracy. Philosophers like John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau heavily influenced political revolutions and the formation of modern democratic states. While history is a field of study, it wasn't necessarily undergoing the same kind of radical advancement *because* of Enlightenment ideals. Theatre, while certainly evolving, wasn't as directly and fundamentally reshaped by Enlightenment principles as science and politics were. The Enlightenment was all about using reason to understand the world and govern society, making science and politics the two key areas of advancement.
