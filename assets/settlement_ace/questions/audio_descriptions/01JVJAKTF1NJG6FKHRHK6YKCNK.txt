The English legal system is structured like a pyramid, with different courts handling different levels of cases. At the base of this pyramid, dealing with the most common and least serious offences, you'll find the Magistrates' Court. Think of them as the workhorses of the justice system, handling things like traffic violations, minor theft, and public disorder offences. These courts aim to resolve cases quickly and efficiently. The key thing to remember is that Magistrates' Courts handle "summary offences," meaning offences that can be dealt with without a jury trial. They also deal with preliminary hearings for more serious crimes, deciding whether there's enough evidence to send the case to the Crown Court. The Crown Court, on the other hand, deals with more serious crimes like murder or rape, which require a jury trial. The High Court handles civil cases and appeals from lower courts. So, when you think of minor criminal cases, picture the Magistrates' Court as the first port of call in England and Wales.
