Youth Courts in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland deal with criminal cases involving individuals aged 10 to 17. Because of the sensitive nature of these cases, the court composition is carefully considered. You might think a single judge would handle it, but the system actually relies on a panel. The correct answer is "Up to 3 specially trained magistrates and a District Judge" because the law stipulates that youth courts are usually presided over by a panel of magistrates who have received special training to deal with young people. These magistrates bring local knowledge and community understanding to the proceedings. A District Judge, a professional and salaried judge, also sits on the panel to provide legal expertise and guidance. The presence of both magistrates and a judge ensures a balanced approach, considering both the legal aspects and the welfare of the young person involved. While a sheriff is a judicial officer in some legal systems, they don't preside over Youth Courts in the UK. And while a panel of five magistrates might seem like a good idea, the law specifies a maximum of three alongside the District Judge.
