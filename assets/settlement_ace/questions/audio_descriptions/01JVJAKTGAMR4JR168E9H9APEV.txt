Britain played a pivotal role in shaping the 20th century through innovation. When we think about inventions that truly defined the era, television and Concorde stand out as prime examples of British ingenuity. Television, while seeing early development elsewhere, was significantly advanced in Britain by John Logie Baird in the 1920s, paving the way for the widespread adoption of this transformative medium. Concorde, a joint Anglo-French project, represents a pinnacle of aviation engineering. This supersonic passenger jet, which first flew in 1969, drastically reduced transatlantic travel times and captured the world's imagination. While aspirin was indeed a groundbreaking invention, it was developed in Germany. Similarly, the AC motor, though crucial to modern technology, has its roots in the work of Nikola Tesla and others outside of Britain. Therefore, television and Concorde are the inventions most closely and accurately associated with Britain in the 20th century.
