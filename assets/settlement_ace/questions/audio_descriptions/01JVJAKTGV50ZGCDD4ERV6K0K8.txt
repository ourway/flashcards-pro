The Giant's Causeway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Northern Ireland, is a fascinating geological formation of interlocking basalt columns. Its creation is linked to intense volcanic activity during the Paleogene period. Around 50 to 60 million years ago, this region experienced significant volcanic eruptions. Molten basalt rock rose to the surface and cooled rapidly. As the lava cooled, it contracted and fractured, resulting in the distinctive hexagonal columns we see today. So, when we're talking about the Giant's Causeway, we're dealing with a timeframe of tens of millions of years, not just a few million. The other options, like 10, 20, or 30 million years ago, are simply too recent to account for the volcanic events that shaped this incredible landscape. It's a testament to the Earth's powerful geological processes operating over vast stretches of time.
