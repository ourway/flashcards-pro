The Proms, short for Promenade Concerts, are a classical music festival held every summer in London. The BBC has been organizing these concerts since 1927, but the Proms themselves actually started even earlier, in 1895! The idea behind them was to make classical music more accessible to the general public. That's why they're called "Promenade Concerts" â€“ because originally, people could walk around or promenade during the performances, making it a more relaxed atmosphere than traditional formal concerts. The BBC took over the Proms to ensure their continued success and broadcast them widely, bringing classical music into homes across the UK. While the Eisteddfod is a Welsh festival celebrating literature, music, and performance, and the Aldeburgh Festival focuses on classical music and opera in Suffolk, neither of these are organized by the BBC and neither have the same national prominence and history as the Proms. Glastonbury, of course, is famous but for contemporary music, not classical. The Proms, with its long history and BBC backing, is the correct answer.
