Okay, let's talk about when coins first showed up in Britain. Think back to the Iron Age, roughly from 800 BC to the Roman invasion in 43 AD. This period was a time of significant societal change. People were developing more sophisticated tools and weapons made of iron, hence the name. They were also establishing more complex trade networks. Now, before coins, people bartered, exchanging goods directly. But as trade grew, this became inefficient. Coins, small pieces of metal with a standardized value, made transactions much easier. So, while people were using stone and bronze tools way before the Iron Age, they hadn't yet developed the technology or the economic need for coinage. And of course, the Middle Ages came much later, long after the Romans had been and gone, and by then coins were well-established. The Iron Age represents that sweet spot where the technology and the need for coins aligned. It's a sign of a developing economy and more complex social structures.
