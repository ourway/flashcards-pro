Easter's timing is a bit unique because it's tied to both the lunar cycle and the arrival of spring. Specifically, Easter Sunday always falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon that occurs on or after the spring equinox. The spring equinox, which marks the beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere, happens around March 20th or 21st. So, if the full moon happens shortly after the equinox, Easter could be in March. If the full moon is later, Easter will be in April. This is why you'll never see Easter in November, December, January, February, May, or June. It's a spring festival, deeply rooted in Christian tradition, celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Easter bunny and Easter egg hunts are more secular traditions that have become associated with the holiday over time, symbolizing new life and springtime.
