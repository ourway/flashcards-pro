The Bill of Rights in 1689 is a cornerstone of British constitutional history, marking a significant shift in power dynamics. Before this, English monarchs held considerable authority, often clashing with Parliament. Think back to the Stuart kings, like Charles I, whose belief in the divine right of kings led to civil war. The Bill of Rights emerged after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, when James II was replaced by William and Mary. Parliament seized the opportunity to ensure this wouldn't happen again. The key purpose of the Bill of Rights was to limit the power of the monarchy and establish parliamentary supremacy. It outlined specific rights and liberties for the people and Parliament, such as freedom of speech in Parliament and the requirement for regular parliamentary elections. Therefore, the correct answer is the king, because the Bill of Rights directly curtailed the monarch's powers, preventing them from acting without Parliament's consent. The other options are incorrect because the Bill of Rights was specifically designed to address the imbalance of power between the monarch and Parliament, not to directly limit the powers of judges, the Church, or Parliament itself.
