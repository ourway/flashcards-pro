Imagine medieval England, a time long before modern medicine. In 1348, a terrifying disease swept across the country, leaving devastation in its wake. This wasn't just a bad flu; it was a bubonic plague, one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. It's known as the Black Death because one of the symptoms was black boils, or buboes, that appeared on the skin of the infected. The disease spread rapidly through fleas on rats, and because hygiene was poor and medical knowledge limited, people were helpless against it. The Black Death wiped out a huge proportion of the population, some estimates say as much as half of England's people died. The other options are incorrect because they refer to other diseases, but none had the same devastating impact on England at this specific time. The Black Death is a key event in British history, marking a turning point in society and labor relations due to the massive loss of life.
