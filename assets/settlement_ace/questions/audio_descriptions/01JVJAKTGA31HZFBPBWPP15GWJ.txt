The 1930s were a period of significant technological advancement, and Britain was at the forefront of many of these innovations. While experimental broadcasts had been happening for a few years prior, it was in 1936 that the British Broadcasting Corporation, or BBC, launched the world's first regular, high-definition television service from Alexandra Palace in London. This marked a pivotal moment in broadcasting history, making television a scheduled part of daily life for those who could afford the expensive sets. The service was initially limited to a small area around London, but it paved the way for the widespread adoption of television after World War II. So, while the other dates might seem plausible, 1936 is the specific year the BBC made TV a regular offering, not just an experiment.
