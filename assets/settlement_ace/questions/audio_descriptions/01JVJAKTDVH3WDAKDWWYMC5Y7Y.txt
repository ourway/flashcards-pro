St. Valentine's Day, celebrated on February 14th, has evolved over centuries from a religious feast day to a celebration of love and affection. While exchanging cards and gifts between couples is certainly a modern and widespread practice, the tradition of secret admirers sending unsigned cards captures a more historical and playful aspect of the holiday. This custom dates back to the Victorian era when expressing feelings directly was often considered improper. Sending an anonymous Valentine allowed individuals to express their affections without revealing their identity, adding an element of mystery and intrigue. The fun was in the guessing game! While engagements, weddings, and couples exchanging gifts are associated with love and relationships, they aren't specifically tied to the unique tradition of anonymous admiration that defines the historical roots of St. Valentine's Day. So, while receiving a gift from your partner is lovely, a card from a secret admirer embodies the classic Valentine's Day spirit.
