Henry VIII is a pivotal figure in English history, primarily remembered for his six wives and his break with the Roman Catholic Church. Before Henry, England was Catholic, and the Pope held significant influence. However, Henry desperately wanted a male heir to secure the Tudor dynasty, and when the Pope refused to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Henry took matters into his own hands. In 1534, he declared himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England, effectively creating a new church where he could grant himself a divorce. This act, known as the English Reformation, had profound and lasting consequences for England's religious and political landscape. Elizabeth I was the daughter of Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. While Edward I and Henry V were important monarchs, they lived centuries before Elizabeth. Henry VII was indeed a Tudor king, and Henry VIII's father, but he was Elizabeth's grandfather, not her father.
