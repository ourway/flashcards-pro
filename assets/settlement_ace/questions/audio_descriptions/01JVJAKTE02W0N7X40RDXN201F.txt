Alright, let's delve into the history of Danish rule in England! To understand why Cnut, also known as Canute, was the first Danish King, we need to remember the Viking age and its impact on Britain. The Vikings, including the Danes, raided and eventually settled in parts of England from the 9th century onwards. By the early 11th century, Danish power was on the rise. Cnut the Great, a Danish prince, invaded England in 1015, and after a series of battles, he became King of England in 1016. He then inherited the Danish throne in 1018, effectively uniting England, Denmark, and Norway under his rule. This made him the first Danish King to also rule England. While William the Conqueror was a significant figure, he was Norman, not Danish. Kenneth MacAlpin is associated with the unification of Scotland, and Harold was the last Anglo-Saxon king before the Norman invasion, so neither of them were Danish kings. Cnut's reign marked a significant period of Danish influence in England, making him the correct answer.
