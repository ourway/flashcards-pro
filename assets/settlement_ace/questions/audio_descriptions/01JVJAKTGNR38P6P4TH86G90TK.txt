The Boer War, fought between 1899 and 1902, was a really messy and controversial conflict in South Africa, and it definitely *didn't* solidify the idea that the British Empire was a force for good. The war was fought between the British Empire and the Boers, who were descendants of Dutch settlers. The British wanted control of the region because of its rich mineral resources, like gold and diamonds. However, the war exposed some pretty ugly truths about the Empire. The British used scorched earth tactics, destroying Boer farms and homes. They also created concentration camps where thousands of Boer civilians, including women and children, died from disease and starvation. News of these atrocities back home in Britain and around the world sparked widespread criticism and damaged the Empire's reputation. So, while some people in Britain might have still believed in the Empire's good intentions, the Boer War actually fueled anti-imperialist sentiment and revealed the darker side of colonial expansion.
