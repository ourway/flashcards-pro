Okay, let's talk about the Cenotaph in Whitehall. After World War I, there was a huge desire to commemorate the war dead. Many bodies were never recovered, so traditional burials weren't always possible. This led to the creation of war memorials across the country, but the Cenotaph in London became the national focal point. The word "Cenotaph" comes from the Greek, meaning "empty tomb," which is quite poignant when you think about it. It was originally a temporary structure made of wood and plaster for the 1919 peace celebrations, but it became so popular that a permanent version made of Portland stone was built in 1920. It's a simple, yet powerful design, and it's the site of the annual Remembrance Day ceremony where the monarch and other dignitaries lay wreaths. So, when you think of a major war memorial in Whitehall, the Cenotaph is the one, not some place like Dumfries or a building like the White Tower. The Royal Crescent is a building in Bath, so that is also incorrect.
