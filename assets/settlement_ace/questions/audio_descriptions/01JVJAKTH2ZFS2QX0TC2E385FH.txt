Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland, and as such, it's the home of the Scottish Parliament. Think of it like this: London is the capital of the UK and houses the UK Parliament; similarly, Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland and houses the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Parliament was established in 1999 following a referendum where the Scottish people voted in favour of having their own devolved government. Before 1707, Scotland had its own independent parliament, which was then dissolved when the Acts of Union created Great Britain. The modern Scottish Parliament deals with many issues specific to Scotland, like education, healthcare, and some aspects of law. While Glasgow is the largest city in Scotland and a major economic hub, and Aberdeen is known as the oil capital, neither of them are the seat of the Scottish government. Dundee, while a significant city, also doesn't host the parliament. So, when you think of Scottish government and politics, remember Edinburgh as the capital and the location of the Scottish Parliament.
