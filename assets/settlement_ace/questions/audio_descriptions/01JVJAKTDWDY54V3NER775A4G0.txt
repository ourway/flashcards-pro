St. George is the legendary figure who has become synonymous with England, embodying ideals of bravery, honour, and chivalry. While the historical details of his life are somewhat murky – he's believed to have been a Roman soldier of Greek origin who was martyred for his Christian faith in the 4th century – his legend really took off in Europe during the Crusades. Soldiers returning from the Middle East spread tales of his courage, particularly his famous slaying of a dragon. This dragon-slaying narrative became a powerful symbol of good triumphing over evil. In England, St. George's popularity soared, and he was officially recognised as the patron saint of England in the 14th century during the reign of King Edward III. His feast day, celebrated on April 23rd, is a day to commemorate his virtues and English identity. It's interesting to note that while St. Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland and St. David is the patron saint of Wales, St. George holds this special place for England.
