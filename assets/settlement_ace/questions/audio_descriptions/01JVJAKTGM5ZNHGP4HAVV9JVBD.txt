The 1944 Education Act, often called the Butler Act after R.A. Butler, the then President of the Board of Education, was a pivotal moment in British history. Before this act, secondary education wasn't universally accessible. Many children, especially those from poorer backgrounds, left school at 14. The Butler Act aimed to change this by creating a more structured and equitable education system. It introduced free secondary education for all children in England and Wales, raising the school leaving age to 15. This meant that every child, regardless of their family's income, had the opportunity to continue their education beyond primary school. While the Act had implications for Wales as well, the question specifically asks about England. It's also important to remember that while the Act was revolutionary, it focused on secondary, not primary, college, or university education. The Butler Act laid the foundation for the modern education system we know today, ensuring that secondary education was a right, not a privilege.
