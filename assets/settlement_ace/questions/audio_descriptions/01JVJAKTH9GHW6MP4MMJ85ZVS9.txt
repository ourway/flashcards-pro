Female genital mutilation, or FGM, is a deeply harmful practice with no medical benefits. It involves intentionally altering or injuring female genitalia for non-medical reasons. Because of the severe physical and psychological harm it causes, the UK has very strict laws against it. The Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 makes it illegal to practice FGM in the UK, and also makes it illegal to take a British national or permanent resident abroad for FGM, even if it's legal in that other country. The law aims to protect women and girls from this form of abuse and reflects the UK's commitment to gender equality and human rights. So, the statement that FGM is illegal in the UK is absolutely true, and the penalties for performing or assisting with FGM can be severe, including imprisonment.
