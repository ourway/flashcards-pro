The Battle of Agincourt, a really significant event in British history, took place in 1415. It was a key battle during the Hundred Years' War, a long and complex conflict between England and France for control of the French throne. Think of it as a really long-running family feud, but with armies! King Henry V of England, despite being heavily outnumbered and facing terrible weather conditions, led his English forces to a stunning victory against the French army on French soil. The English army was known for its skilled longbowmen, whose arrows proved devastating. While Wales and Scotland are part of the UK today, they weren't the main players in this particular historical drama. So, Agincourt is all about the clash between England and France, a pivotal moment that shaped the relationship between these two nations for centuries.
