Joining the European Union, or the European Economic Community as it was originally known, was a long and complex process for the UK. The initial attempts to join actually happened in the 1960s, with applications in both 1961 and 1967. However, these were vetoed by the French President Charles de Gaulle, who felt the UK wasn't ready and had too many ties with the United States. It wasn't until after de Gaulle left office that the path cleared. In 1973, under Prime Minister Edward Heath, the UK finally became a member. This was a significant moment, marking a major shift in the UK's economic and political alignment. The years 1957, 1961, and 1967 are tempting because they represent earlier milestones in European integration or previous attempts by the UK to join. However, 1973 is the specific year when the UK's membership officially began.
