Free Schools are a relatively recent addition to the English education system, introduced in 2011 as part of a broader effort to diversify school choice and raise standards. The key idea behind them is that they're funded directly by the government but operate independently of local authority control. This means that groups like parents, teachers, charities, businesses, and community organizations can apply to set them up if they believe there's a need for a new school in their area. They have more freedom than traditional state schools over things like the curriculum, school hours, and term dates. The name "Free School" reflects the fact that, like other state schools in England, they are free to attend, with no fees charged to parents. So, while "premium" or "affordable" might sound appealing, they don't reflect the actual name or the funding model of these independently run, state-funded schools.
