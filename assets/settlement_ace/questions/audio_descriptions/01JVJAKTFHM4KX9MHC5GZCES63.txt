The English Civil War, a pivotal moment in British history, was essentially a power struggle between the King and Parliament in the 17th century. Think of it as a clash between two very different visions for how England should be governed. On one side, you had the Cavaliers, also known as Royalists. These were supporters of King Charles I, often wealthy landowners and members of the aristocracy who believed in the divine right of kings â€“ the idea that the king's authority came directly from God. On the other side were the Roundheads, who supported Parliament. This group included many Puritans, merchants, and some members of the gentry who wanted more say in how the country was run and were against the King's absolute power. The name "Roundheads" came from their short haircuts, a stark contrast to the long, fashionable hair of the Cavaliers. So, the Cavaliers and the Roundheads were the two main factions locked in a bloody conflict from 1642 to 1651, fighting over the future of England's monarchy and governance. The other options relate to different periods of British history: the Houses of York and Lancaster were involved in the Wars of the Roses much earlier, the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings fought for control of England in the early medieval period, and the House of Fraser and the House of Stuart are completely unrelated to any war.
