The Chartists were a significant working-class movement in the 19th century, active mainly from 1838 to 1848. They emerged during a time of great social and economic upheaval, fueled by the Industrial Revolution. The movement got its name from the People's Charter, a document outlining six key demands aimed at reforming the electoral system and making it more democratic. While the Chartists had several aims, the most central and well-known was the call for universal male suffrage. At the time, only a small percentage of men, primarily landowners, were allowed to vote. The Chartists believed that giving every man the right to vote, regardless of his social class or wealth, was essential for empowering the working class and ensuring their voices were heard in Parliament. This is why "every man to have a vote" is the correct answer. The other options, while potentially desirable reforms, weren't the core, defining demand of the Chartist movement.
