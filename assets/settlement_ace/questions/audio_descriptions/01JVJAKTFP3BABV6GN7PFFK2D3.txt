Valentine's Day, celebrated on the 14th of February, is a day dedicated to love and affection. Its origins are a bit murky, with some historians linking it to ancient Roman festivals like Lupercalia, a pagan celebration of fertility. Others believe it's connected to one or more early Christian saints named Valentine. Over time, these traditions blended, and by the Middle Ages, Valentine's Day became associated with romantic love. The exchange of cards and gifts became popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, solidifying the holiday as we know it today. So, while the other dates might be significant for other reasons – perhaps a birthday or another holiday – the 14th of February is specifically and traditionally reserved for celebrating love and relationships, making it the correct answer in this context.
