Okay, let's talk about the Glorious Revolution. In the 17th century, there was a lot of religious tension in England between Protestants and Catholics. King James II, who was Catholic, wasn't very popular with many in England, especially the Protestant elite. They were worried he would try to bring Catholicism back as the dominant religion. So, a group of influential Protestants invited William of Orange, who was married to James II's Protestant daughter Mary, to come over from the Netherlands with an army. William landed in England in 1688, and James II fled to France. Because there was very little bloodshed in England during this change of power, it became known as the Glorious Revolution. It was a pivotal moment because it confirmed the supremacy of Parliament over the monarchy and led to the Bill of Rights in 1689, which enshrined important rights and liberties. The other options are incorrect because the Magna Carta was a much earlier document from 1215 limiting the power of the King, the Orange Revolution refers to events in Ukraine, and the Industrial Revolution was a period of major technological advancement in the 18th and 19th centuries.
