England's exploration and colonization of North America really took off during the late 16th century. This was a period of intense rivalry with Spain, and establishing colonies was seen as a way to expand England's power and wealth. Queen Elizabeth I reigned from 1558 to 1603, a time often called the "Elizabethan era," known for exploration, artistic achievement, and a strong sense of national identity. The first, albeit unsuccessful, English colony in North America was Roanoke, established in 1585. A more successful venture was the colony of Virginia, named in honor of Elizabeth I, who was known as the "Virgin Queen" because she never married. This colony was established in the early 17th century, just after her death, but the groundwork was laid during her reign. The other monarchs listed, Edward II, Henry VIII, and Henry VII, all ruled before this period of intense exploration and colonization, making Elizabeth I the correct answer.
