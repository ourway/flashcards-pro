Florence Nightingale is synonymous with modern nursing for good reason. Before her, nursing was often seen as a menial job, lacking proper training or hygiene. During the Crimean War in the 1850s, conditions in British military hospitals were appalling, with incredibly high death rates due to infection. Nightingale, with a team of nurses, was sent to improve the situation. She implemented strict hygiene practices, improved sanitation, and provided compassionate care. The result was a dramatic reduction in mortality rates. Her work revolutionized nursing, establishing it as a respected profession based on scientific principles and compassionate patient care. She later founded the Nightingale Training School for Nurses at St Thomas' Hospital in London, setting the standard for nurse education. While she was a talented writer and statistician, her lasting legacy and primary profession was undoubtedly as a nurse, transforming healthcare and saving countless lives.
