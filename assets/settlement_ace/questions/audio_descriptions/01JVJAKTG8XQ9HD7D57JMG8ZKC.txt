William Wilberforce is a key figure in British history, primarily remembered for his tireless work campaigning against the slave trade. Now, while he was deeply religious and his faith motivated his actions, he wasn't a religious leader in the formal sense. His platform was Parliament. Wilberforce was a Member of Parliament for Hull and later for Bramber for many years, starting in 1780. He used his position within the political system to introduce bills, give speeches, and lobby other politicians to support the abolition of the slave trade. The Slave Trade Act, which outlawed the slave trade in the British Empire, was finally passed in 1807, largely due to his persistent efforts. He continued to advocate for the complete abolition of slavery itself, which was achieved shortly after his death with the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833. So, while the other options might seem plausible, it was his role as a politician that allowed him to be so effective in bringing about this monumental change.
