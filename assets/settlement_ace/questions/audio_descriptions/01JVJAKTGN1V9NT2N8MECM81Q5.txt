The Battle of Waterloo, fought on June 18, 1815, really does mark the end of military conflict between Britain and France. Think of it as the final act in a long-running drama! For centuries, these two nations were often at odds, competing for power and territory. Waterloo was the decisive battle in which the Duke of Wellington, leading a coalition of forces including the British army, defeated Napoleon Bonaparte's French army. Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo effectively ended his reign and the Napoleonic Wars, ushering in a period of relative peace in Europe. While there have been diplomatic tensions and disagreements since then, there hasn't been another military engagement between the two countries. So, remembering Waterloo as the last time British and French soldiers faced each other on the battlefield is a helpful way to recall this historical fact.
