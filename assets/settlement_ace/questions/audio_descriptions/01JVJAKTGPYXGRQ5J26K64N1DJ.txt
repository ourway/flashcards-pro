Okay, let's talk about when English kings finally packed their bags and left France. To understand this, we need to zoom in on the Hundred Years' War. This wasn't actually a hundred years exactly, but a long series of conflicts between England and France that stretched from 1337 to 1453. The English kings, particularly those from the House of Plantagenet, believed they had a legitimate claim to the French throne, and this led to a lot of battles and sieges across the Channel. Think of famous battles like Crécy and Agincourt – big English victories! However, things started to turn in favor of the French, especially with figures like Joan of Arc inspiring their troops. By the 1450s, the English had lost most of their territories in France. The final blow came in 1453, marking the end of the Hundred Years' War and effectively ending the English kings' ambitions of ruling France. So, the 1450s is the correct answer because it represents the decade when the war concluded and English influence in France largely disappeared. The other options are way off, placing the departure of the English kings much earlier in history before the major conflicts even began.
