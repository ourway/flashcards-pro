Cricket is a sport deeply intertwined with the British summer, and its rules are uniquely affected by the weather. Unlike many other sports, cricket matches can last for several days, and the playing conditions are crucial to the game's outcome. Rain significantly impacts the pitch and the ball, making play difficult and potentially dangerous. Because of this, cricket has specific rules about when play can continue after rain. The phrase "rain stopped play" is almost exclusively associated with cricket because it's a common occurrence. While rain might delay or cancel other outdoor sporting events like rugby league, football, or horse racing, the phrase itself isn't a standard part of their vocabulary or rules. Cricket's long match format and sensitivity to weather conditions make "rain stopped play" a familiar and often frustrating part of the game for players and spectators alike.
