Okay, let's talk about UK landmarks. When we think of the UK, it's easy to get mixed up with landmarks from other countries, especially if you're new to the geography. The UK is made up of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, each with its own distinct landscapes. Loch Lomond is a beautiful lake in Scotland, known for its stunning scenery and part of the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park. Snowdonia, on the other hand, is a mountainous region in Wales, home to Mount Snowdon, the highest peak in Wales. These are both iconic natural landmarks firmly within the UK. Notre Dame is, of course, in Paris, France, a famous cathedral with a rich history. And the Grand Canyon? That's a massive canyon in Arizona, USA, a world-famous natural wonder. So, while all are impressive landmarks, only Loch Lomond and Snowdonia are actually located in the United Kingdom.
