In Scotland's legal system, different courts handle different types of cases, much like in England and Wales. The Justice of the Peace Court is where many minor criminal cases are initially dealt with. Think of it as the entry point for less serious offenses. These courts handle things like traffic violations, minor public order offenses, and breaches of the peace. Now, the Sheriff Court does deal with more serious crimes and civil cases, while the Crown Court handles the most serious criminal cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, not Scotland. The Magistrate's Court is also not a Scottish institution. So, when you think about minor offenses in Scotland, remember the Justice of the Peace Court â€“ they are there to keep the peace and handle those smaller legal issues. It's interesting to note that Justice of the Peace roles are often filled by lay people within the community, not always legally trained professionals, which helps keep the system accessible for minor infractions.
