The UK's National Anthem, "God Save the Queen" (or "God Save the King" when there's a male monarch), is one of the most recognizable patriotic songs in the world. Its origins are actually a bit mysterious, but it gained popularity in 1745 during a time of Jacobite rebellions, when people sang it as a show of support for King George II. The anthem is essentially a prayer for the monarch, asking for divine protection, long life, and a victorious reign. So, the lines "God save our gracious Queen!" and "Send her victorious" perfectly capture the core themes of the anthem: loyalty to the monarch and hopes for the country's success. The other options, while perhaps familiar phrases, don't appear in the National Anthem. "We shall never surrender" is associated with Winston Churchill's famous wartime speech, and "The darling buds of May" is a line from a traditional folk song, not the anthem.
