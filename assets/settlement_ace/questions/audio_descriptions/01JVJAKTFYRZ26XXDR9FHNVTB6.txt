The Chartist movement, active mainly between 1838 and 1848, was a working-class campaign for political reform in Britain. Imagine a time when only wealthy landowners could vote and the system was rigged against ordinary people. The Chartists arose from this frustration, demanding a fairer political system. Their aims were outlined in "The People's Charter" â€“ hence their name. While they had six key demands, the question focuses on two specific ones. Annual elections were a big deal because, at the time, parliaments could last for many years, making representatives less accountable. The Chartists believed that yearly elections would force MPs to listen to the people. Secret ballots were also crucial. Before, voting was public, meaning people could be intimidated or bribed to vote a certain way. A secret ballot would allow people to vote freely, without fear of reprisal. So, the correct answer highlights these two important reforms: elections every year to increase accountability and secret ballots to ensure voting privacy. While some Chartists, and later suffrage movements, advocated for women's suffrage, it wasn't a core demand of the original Chartist movement.
