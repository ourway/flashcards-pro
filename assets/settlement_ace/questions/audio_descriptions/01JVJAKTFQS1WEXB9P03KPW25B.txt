The Industrial Revolution, which really took off in the late 1700s and throughout the 1800s, was a period of massive change driven by new machinery and factory production. Think of it as a time of incredible innovation, but also immense social upheaval. One of the biggest downsides was the exploitation of workers. Because the focus was on maximizing profit and production, there were virtually no laws in place to protect people from dangerous working conditions. People, including children, worked incredibly long hours – often 12 to 16 hours a day – in hazardous environments with little to no safety regulations. This lack of regulation led to widespread injuries, illnesses, and even deaths. It wasn't until later, through the efforts of reformers and trade unions, that laws were gradually introduced to improve working conditions and limit working hours. So, the idea that there were strict laws protecting employees during the Industrial Revolution is simply not accurate; it was a time of minimal worker protection.
