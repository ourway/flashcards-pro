The Black Death, a devastating bubonic plague pandemic, swept across Europe, including Britain, in the mid-14th century, primarily between 1348 and 1350. Imagine the sheer terror and disruption it caused! It wasn't just a few isolated cases; it was a widespread catastrophe. Now, while the exact numbers are debated by historians due to limited records from that time, the most widely accepted estimate is that approximately one-third of the population of Britain, and indeed Europe, perished. That's a staggering loss. So, when you think about the Black Death and its impact, remember that it wasn't a small fraction like one-fifth or one-fourth. While those numbers represent significant losses, they don't capture the true scale of the disaster. One-half is also too high. The plague's impact was truly devastating, wiping out around one-third of the population and drastically altering society.
