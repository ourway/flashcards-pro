Okay, let's talk about the rules around selling cigarettes in the UK. The law is very clear on this. It's illegal to sell cigarettes, tobacco, or any nicotine-containing products like e-cigarettes to anyone under the age of 18. This law is in place to protect young people from the harmful effects of smoking and nicotine addiction. It's part of a broader public health strategy aimed at reducing smoking rates across the country. Shops and individuals who break this law can face hefty fines and even prosecution. So, while it might be tempting to think there are loopholes or ways around it, the reality is that selling cigarettes to anyone under 18 is strictly prohibited and has serious consequences.
