The Turner Prize is all about celebrating modern and contemporary art. It's named after J.M.W. Turner, a really influential British painter from the 18th and 19th centuries, known for his dramatic, often abstract, landscapes and seascapes. He was a bit of a rebel for his time, pushing the boundaries of what art could be. The prize, established in 1984, aims to champion similarly innovative and thought-provoking art being made today. It's awarded annually to a British artist for an outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work. You'll often see a wide range of media represented, from painting and sculpture to installation and video. While the other options might seem plausible as prestigious awards, the connection to Turner, a visual artist, is your key clue. The Turner Prize specifically recognizes contributions to the world of contemporary art, not literature, music, or theatre.
