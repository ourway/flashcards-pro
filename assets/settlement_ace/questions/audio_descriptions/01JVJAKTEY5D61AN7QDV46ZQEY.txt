Bodnant Garden, a horticultural jewel in North Wales, is the correct answer because of its unique history and stunning collection of plants from around the world. The garden was established in 1875 by Henry Pochin, a Victorian industrial chemist, and later developed by his grandson, Lord Aberconway. Its location in the Conwy Valley provides a diverse terrain, allowing for a wide range of plants to thrive, from Himalayan poppies to North American trees. The garden is particularly famous for its Laburnum Arch, a breathtaking tunnel of golden flowers that blooms in late spring. While Hidcote, Mount Stewart, and Sissinghurst are all beautiful gardens in the UK, they are located in England and Northern Ireland, respectively. So, when thinking about Welsh gardens, remember the "Bold Bodnant" blooming brightly.
