Okay, let's talk about royal Jubilees! These are celebrations marking significant milestones in a monarch's reign. The word "jubilee" itself comes from Hebrew and signifies a special anniversary. Now, Queen Elizabeth II reigned for an impressive 70 years, making her the longest-reigning British monarch. Different jubilees mark different lengths of service. A Silver Jubilee celebrates 25 years, a Golden Jubilee marks 50 years, a Diamond Jubilee celebrates 60 years, and a Platinum Jubilee celebrates 70 years. Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her Diamond Jubilee in 2012, marking 60 years on the throne since her accession in 1952. The Platinum Jubilee was celebrated in 2022. So, while she had other jubilees, the Diamond Jubilee was specifically the one celebrated in 2012.
