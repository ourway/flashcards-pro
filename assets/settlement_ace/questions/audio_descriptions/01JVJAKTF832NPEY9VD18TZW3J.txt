Okay, let's delve into the history of English influence in Ireland and understand why the year 1200 is significant. Following the Norman invasion of England in 1066, the Normans, under the leadership of Strongbow, began to arrive in Ireland in the late 12th century. Over time, they established a foothold, particularly around Dublin. By the year 1200, the English crown, under King John, had consolidated its power enough to establish direct rule over a specific area surrounding Dublin. This area became known as "The Pale." Think of it as the area directly controlled by the English, where English laws and customs were enforced. It was essentially a fortified zone, marking the boundary between English and Gaelic Irish territories. While English influence continued to expand and contract over the centuries, the establishment of the Pale around 1200 represents a key moment in the history of English involvement in Ireland. The other dates are incorrect because they don't align with the period when the English crown had sufficient control to formally establish and administer the Pale around Dublin.
