The UK places a high value on freedom of expression and the right to hold and express personal opinions. This is deeply rooted in the country's history and legal system. Landmark documents like the Magna Carta of 1215, while not directly addressing freedom of opinion in the modern sense, laid the groundwork for individual rights against arbitrary power. Over centuries, this evolved into a strong tradition of free speech, parliamentary debate, and a vibrant press. Today, the Human Rights Act 1998, which incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law, explicitly protects freedom of thought, conscience, and expression. So, while there are of course limits to free speech, such as incitement to violence or hate speech, the general principle is that people are free to hold and express their own opinions without fear of persecution. That's why it's correct to say that in the UK, other people's rights to their own opinions are respected.
