Saint Patrick's Cross, also known as Saint Patrick's Saltire, is a red diagonal cross on a white field. It's important to remember that it's diagonal, unlike the upright red cross of Saint George, which represents England. The Saint Patrick's Cross is associated with Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland, although its exact origins are debated. Some believe it was derived from the arms of the FitzGerald family, powerful figures in Irish history. The cross was later incorporated into the Union Flag of the United Kingdom in 1801, following the Act of Union between Great Britain and Ireland. So, when you see that diagonal red cross on a white background, remember it represents Ireland and is a key part of the UK's flag's history. The other options are incorrect because they either depict an upright cross, use the wrong colors, or reference a Welsh symbol, which is not related to Saint Patrick or the flag.
