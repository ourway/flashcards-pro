The Grand National is a world-famous horse race held annually at Aintree Racecourse near Liverpool. Its roots go back to 1839, making it one of the oldest and most challenging steeplechases in the world. Steeplechases are horse races where horses jump over obstacles. The Grand National is particularly known for its demanding course, featuring large fences like Becher's Brook and The Chair, which test the skill and endurance of both horse and rider. While rugby, golf, and tennis are all popular sports in the UK, they have no connection to the Grand National. People might be tempted to think of other sports, but the Grand National is synonymous with horse racing, drawing huge crowds and media attention every year. It's a key event in the British sporting calendar, steeped in tradition and excitement.
