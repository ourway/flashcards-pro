Saint David, or Dewi Sant in Welsh, is the patron saint of Wales, and his influence is deeply woven into Welsh culture and identity. He lived in the 6th century and was known for his piety and founding of monasteries. The most famous story about him involves a miracle where the ground rose beneath him so everyone could hear him preach! St David's Day is celebrated on March 1st, and it's a national day in Wales. People often wear daffodils or leeks, which are national symbols, and traditional Welsh costumes. Now, while England has St. George, Scotland has St. Andrew, and Northern Ireland has St. Patrick, St. David is specifically associated with Wales. So, when you think of Welsh national identity and its patron saint, St. David is the key figure. Remembering the dragon on the Welsh flag, a powerful symbol of Wales, can also help you connect St. David to the country.
