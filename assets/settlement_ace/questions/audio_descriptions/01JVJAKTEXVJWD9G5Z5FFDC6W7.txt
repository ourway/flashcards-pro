The Commonwealth's roots lie in the British Empire, but it evolved significantly. As countries gained independence, the aim was to maintain positive relationships. The Commonwealth isn't about Britain ruling former colonies anymore; it's a voluntary association of 56 independent countries. The key thing to remember is that these nations collaborate on various fronts, particularly democracy and economic development. They share values and work together to improve the lives of their citizens. So, when you see "collaborative association" and "shared goals in democracy and development," that accurately describes the modern Commonwealth. It's not a political union like the EU, but more of a cooperative network. Some people might think it's false because of the Empire's history, but the Commonwealth today is focused on mutual support and progress.
