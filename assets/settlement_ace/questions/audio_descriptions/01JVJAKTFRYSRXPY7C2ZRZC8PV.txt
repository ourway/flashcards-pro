The Welsh flag, officially adopted in 1959, is quite distinctive and features a prominent red dragon, known as "Y Ddraig Goch" in Welsh, which translates to "The Red Dragon." This dragon isn't just a random design; it's deeply rooted in Welsh history and mythology. The red dragon has been associated with Wales for centuries, possibly dating back to Roman times, although its prominence grew during the reign of the Welsh king Cadwaladr around the 7th century. It gained further significance through the legends of King Arthur and Merlin, where the red dragon symbolized the Welsh people's resistance against invaders. The flag itself consists of the red dragon passant on a green and white field. The green and white colors represent the House of Tudor, a Welsh dynasty that ruled England from 1485 to 1603. So, when you think of the Welsh flag, remember the powerful red dragon, a symbol of Welsh identity, history, and pride.
