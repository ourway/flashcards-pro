The Corn Laws were a really significant part of 19th-century British history, and understanding them helps explain a lot about the social and economic changes of the time. Basically, these laws, which were in place from 1815, put tariffs on imported grain, making it more expensive. This was great for British landowners, who could charge more for their own grain, but it was terrible for the working classes, who had to pay higher prices for bread. Think of it like this: it protected the wealthy at the expense of the poor. As the Industrial Revolution progressed, more and more people moved to cities and relied on buying food. The high prices caused widespread discontent and became a major political issue. After years of campaigning by groups like the Anti-Corn Law League, and facing a devastating famine in Ireland, Parliament finally repealed the Corn Laws in 1846. This decision marked a shift towards free trade and was a victory for the growing industrial middle class. So, yes, it's absolutely correct that the Corn Laws were annulled in 1846.
