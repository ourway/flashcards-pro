April Fool's Day, celebrated on the 1st of April, is a tradition where people play practical jokes and hoaxes on each other. Its origins are a bit murky, but one popular theory links it to the shift from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century. Some suggest that those who were slow to get the news or failed to recognize that New Year's Day had moved to January 1st continued to celebrate it on April 1st and became the butt of jokes, labelled as "April fools." Over time, this evolved into a day dedicated to light-hearted trickery. Newspapers and TV broadcasts often participate by reporting outlandish, fabricated stories designed to fool the public. While Boxing Day is a day for giving, Halloween for costumes and scares, and Valentine's Day for romance, none of these are associated with widespread pranks and hoaxes like April Fool's Day.
