Okay, here's an explanation for the question about the event where Protestants asked William of Orange to invade England:

The late 17th century in England was a period of religious and political tension. King James II, a Catholic, was on the throne, and many Protestants feared he would try to restore Catholicism as the dominant religion. This fear was heightened by the birth of his son, which meant a Catholic heir. Leading Protestant figures, worried about the future of Protestantism in England, secretly contacted William of Orange, the Protestant ruler of the Netherlands and husband of James II's daughter, Mary. They invited him to invade England and take the throne. William landed with an army in 1688, and James II, facing widespread opposition, fled to France. This event is known as the Glorious Revolution because it largely occurred without significant bloodshed in England. It was a pivotal moment as it replaced a Catholic monarch with a Protestant one and, crucially, established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown, laying the foundation for the constitutional monarchy that exists today. The other options are incorrect because the Enlightenment was a broader intellectual movement, the Battle of Britain was a World War II air campaign, and the Butler Act was related to education in the 20th century.
