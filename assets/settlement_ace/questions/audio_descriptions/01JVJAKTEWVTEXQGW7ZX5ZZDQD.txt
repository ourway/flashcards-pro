Okay, let's talk about UK music festivals. Britain has a huge music scene, and outdoor festivals are a massive part of that culture, especially during the summer months. Glastonbury, held in Somerset, is probably the most famous. It started in 1970, the day after Jimi Hendrix died, and has grown into a massive, multi-stage event showcasing everything from rock and pop to dance and world music. It's known for its eclectic atmosphere and often features surprise performances and political activism. The Isle of Wight Festival, with its roots stretching back to the late 1960s, is another major player. It famously hosted Jimi Hendrix's last UK performance in 1970. It was revived in 2002 and continues to attract big names and large crowds. So, Glastonbury and the Isle of Wight Festival are the two that are widely recognised as major outdoor music festivals. Royal Ascot, while a significant event, is a horse racing event, not a music festival. Hogmanay is the Scottish New Year's Eve celebration, a cultural festival, but not primarily focused on music in the same way.
