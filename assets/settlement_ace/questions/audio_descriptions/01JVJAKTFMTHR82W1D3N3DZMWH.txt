England's culinary landscape is often defined by hearty, comforting dishes, reflecting its agricultural history and coastal location. Roast beef, in particular, has long been associated with England, even earning the English the nickname "les rosbifs" from the French. This tradition dates back centuries, with Sunday roasts becoming a staple in many households. Yorkshire puddings, light and airy baked batter, are the perfect accompaniment, traditionally served with gravy to soak up the delicious juices. Fish and chips, on the other hand, emerged in the 19th century as a working-class meal, combining fried fish from the coast with fried potatoes, a relatively new and affordable food source at the time. This combination quickly became a national favourite, synonymous with seaside towns and English culture. While haggis is a Scottish delicacy, Ulster fry is from Northern Ireland, and Welsh cakes are, of course, from Wales, roast beef with Yorkshire puddings and fish and chips are the dishes most closely tied to England's culinary identity.
