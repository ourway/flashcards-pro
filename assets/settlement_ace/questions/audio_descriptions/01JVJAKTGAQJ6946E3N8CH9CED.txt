Edinburgh, a city steeped in history and culture, is undeniably located in Scotland. To understand why, think about Scotland's distinct identity within the UK. Scotland has its own legal and education systems, its own banknotes, and a strong sense of national pride. Edinburgh, as the capital city, is the heart of this Scottish identity. It's home to the Scottish Parliament, where laws specific to Scotland are debated and passed. The city's iconic landmarks, like Edinburgh Castle perched atop an ancient volcano and the Royal Mile, are deeply intertwined with Scottish history, from the medieval period through the Jacobite rebellions. While Wales and Northern Ireland are also constituent countries of the UK with their own capitals (Cardiff and Belfast respectively), Edinburgh is definitively north of the border, within Scotland. England, of course, has its own capital in London. So, when you think of Edinburgh, think of kilts, haggis, and the unmistakable sound of bagpipes â€“ all hallmarks of Scottish culture.
