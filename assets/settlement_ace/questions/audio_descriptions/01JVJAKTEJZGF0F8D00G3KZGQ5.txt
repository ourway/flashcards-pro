The Northern Ireland Assembly, established as part of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, aimed to bring an end to decades of conflict. However, the path to lasting peace hasn't been without its bumps. The Assembly is a devolved government, meaning it has powers over local matters, but the UK government retains ultimate authority. Unfortunately, due to breakdowns in political agreement and disputes between parties, the Assembly hasn't always been able to function smoothly. There have been several periods where the UK government has had to step in and suspend the Assembly's powers. These suspensions occurred in 2002, 2003, and again for a prolonged period between 2017 and 2020. So, while the hope was for continuous self-governance, the reality is that the UK government has, on more than one occasion, found it necessary to temporarily suspend the Northern Ireland Assembly to try and resolve political crises.
