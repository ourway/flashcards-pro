The Citizens Advice Bureau, often just called Citizens Advice, is a really important organization in the UK. It was originally set up in 1939 at the start of World War II to offer advice to people dealing with all sorts of problems caused by the war. Over time, it's evolved to provide free, confidential, and impartial advice on a huge range of issues, including debt, housing, employment, and, crucially, domestic violence. Because they are independent and not part of the government, people often trust them to give unbiased advice. So, if someone is experiencing domestic violence, the Citizens Advice Bureau is a reliable place to go for help because they can provide information on legal rights, housing options, financial assistance, and connect individuals with specialist support services. While the High Court deals with legal matters, it's not the first port of call for immediate help. The NSPCC focuses on child protection, and while family might be supportive, they aren't always equipped to provide the necessary professional advice and resources.
