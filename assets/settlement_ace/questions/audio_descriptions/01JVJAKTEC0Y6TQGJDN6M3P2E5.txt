Okay, let's break down why "devolved administrations" is the right term for the governing bodies in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Think of the word "devolve," which means to pass on or delegate power. That's exactly what happened here. For centuries, the UK Parliament in Westminster held almost all the power. But over time, especially in the late 20th century, there was a growing movement to give Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland more control over their own affairs. So, the UK Parliament passed laws to "devolve" certain powers to these regions. This means they gained the authority to make decisions on things like education, healthcare, and some aspects of law and order. These new bodies weren't just local councils; they were mini-governments with real legislative power. That's why they're called "devolved administrations" â€“ because they "administer" or govern, using powers that have been "devolved" to them from the central UK government. It's a system designed to balance national unity with regional autonomy.
