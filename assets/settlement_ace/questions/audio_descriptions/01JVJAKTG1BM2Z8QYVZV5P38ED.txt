Snowdon is, without a doubt, a mountain, and a very famous one at that! It's the highest mountain in Wales, standing at 1,085 metres (3,560 ft) above sea level. The name Snowdon comes from the Old English "Snow Dun," meaning "snow hill," which makes sense considering it often has snow on its peak, especially during winter. Snowdonia National Park, where Snowdon is located, is a beautiful area with rugged landscapes and is a popular destination for hikers and climbers. You might be tempted to think of a lake because Wales has some stunning lakes, or a castle because Wales is famous for its castles, but Snowdon is specifically a mountain. It's not a garden either, although there are beautiful gardens elsewhere in Wales. Remembering that Snowdon is the highest peak in Wales should help you recall that it's a mountain on the test.
