The UK's national anthem, "God Save the Queen" (or "God Save the King" when there's a male monarch), isn't reserved only for occasions when the monarch is physically present. Think of it more as a symbol of the nation and the Crown, representing loyalty and patriotism. It's played at a wide range of events, from sporting competitions like football matches and the Olympics, to national celebrations and royal occasions, regardless of whether the Queen or King is there in person. It's even played at the end of some cinema showings! The anthem's origins trace back to the 18th century, and it became widely adopted as the national anthem over time. So, while it's definitely associated with the monarch, its use isn't limited to their direct presence. A common misconception might be that it's only for the Queen because it mentions her, but its broader use signifies respect for the Crown and the country as a whole.
