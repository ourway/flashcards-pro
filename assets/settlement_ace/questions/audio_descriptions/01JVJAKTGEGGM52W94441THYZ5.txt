Scotland's history is rich and complex, and its capital city reflects that. While Glasgow is the largest city in Scotland, known for its industrial past and vibrant cultural scene, Edinburgh has been the capital since the 15th century. Specifically, it became the capital in 1437. Edinburgh's selection wasn't arbitrary; its strategic location, the presence of Edinburgh Castle, and its growing importance as a centre of law and governance all contributed to its rise. The Scottish Parliament is also located in Edinburgh. Belfast is the capital of Northern Ireland, and Cardiff is the capital of Wales, so while they are important cities within the UK, they have no connection to Scotland's capital. So, Edinburgh is the correct answer because it has been the established seat of Scottish government and administration for centuries.
