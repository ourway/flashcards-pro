Okay, let's break down the voter registration process across the UK. Generally, Great Britain – that's England, Scotland, and Wales – operates under a system where one person in a household can register everyone living at that address. This is often called household registration. It's designed to be convenient and efficient. However, Northern Ireland is different. Due to its unique political history and the need to prevent electoral fraud, it uses individual voter registration. This means every eligible voter in Northern Ireland must complete their own registration form. This system ensures a higher level of accuracy and accountability in the electoral process. So, while Wales and Scotland are part of Great Britain and generally use household registration, the statement is false because it's Northern Ireland where individual registration is the standard. It's easy to get confused, but remembering Northern Ireland's specific historical context helps clarify why they have this stricter individual system.
