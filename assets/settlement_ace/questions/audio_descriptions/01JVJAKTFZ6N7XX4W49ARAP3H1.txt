1918 marks a pivotal moment in British history, specifically for women's rights. For decades, the suffragette and suffragist movements campaigned tirelessly, using various methods from peaceful protests to more radical actions, to achieve voting rights for women. World War I played a significant role in shifting public opinion. Women stepped into traditionally male roles in the workforce, proving their capabilities and contributing significantly to the war effort. The Representation of the People Act in 1918 granted the vote to women over the age of 30 who met certain property qualifications. While this wasn't universal suffrage – all women over 21 didn't get the vote until 1928 – it was a monumental first step, enfranchising around 8.4 million women and acknowledging their vital role in society. The other options are incorrect because, while divorce laws and equal pay were later advancements for women, they didn't happen in 1918. Similarly, making women legally responsible for their children was already the case.
