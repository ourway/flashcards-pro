Alright, let's talk about the Roman occupation of Britain. The Romans first rocked up in 55 BC with Julius Caesar, but it wasn't until nearly a century later, in 43 AD under Emperor Claudius, that they really began their serious conquest and settlement. Think of it as a long-term lease! They then stuck around until about 410 AD. So, if you do the math, that's roughly 367 years, but we round it up to approximately 400 years. This long period had a massive impact on Britain, influencing everything from language and law to architecture and infrastructure. They built roads, towns, and bathhouses, some of which you can still see today. While 100, 200, or 300 years might seem like a long time, they simply don't capture the full extent of the Roman presence and its lasting legacy on the island.
