Between 1870 and 1914, Britain saw a significant influx of immigrants, particularly from Eastern Europe. This was a period of immense upheaval and persecution in countries like Russia and Poland, where Jewish communities faced pogroms and discriminatory laws. Seeking safety and better opportunities, many Jews made the journey west. Britain, with its relatively tolerant society and established Jewish community, became a primary destination. While it's easy to overestimate or underestimate the numbers involved in such a large movement of people, historical records indicate that approximately 120,000 Russian and Polish Jews immigrated to Britain during this period. This wave of immigration had a lasting impact, enriching British society and contributing to its cultural diversity. While 60,000 or even 30,000 might seem like large numbers, they don't reflect the scale of this particular migration. And while 140,000 is closer, the documented figure is around 120,000.
