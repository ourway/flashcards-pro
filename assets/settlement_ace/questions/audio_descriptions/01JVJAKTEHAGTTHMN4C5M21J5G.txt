When you're learning to drive in the UK, getting your license is all about proving you can handle a car safely and know the rules of the road. Think of it this way: driving isn't just about knowing where the pedals are; it's about applying that knowledge in real-time, on actual roads, with other drivers around. That's why the test focuses on two key areas: your practical skills, meaning your ability to control the car, manoeuvre, and react to situations, and your knowledge of the Highway Code, road signs, and traffic laws. While an eye test is a prerequisite to ensure you meet the minimum vision requirements, it's not the core competency being evaluated during the driving test itself. The test is about demonstrating you can drive safely and responsibly, using both your hands and your head.
