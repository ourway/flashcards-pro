Portsmouth is deeply intertwined with British naval history, making it the home of the HMS Victory. Think of Portsmouth as the historical heart of the Royal Navy. The HMS Victory was Admiral Lord Nelson's flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, a pivotal naval battle where the British defeated Napoleon's combined French and Spanish fleet. Nelson died during the battle, securing his place as a national hero. After its active service, the HMS Victory was brought back to Portsmouth, where it has been preserved as a museum ship. It's one of the most famous and well-preserved warships in the world. While London has its own maritime history, including the Cutty Sark, it's Portsmouth that specifically houses the HMS Victory. Dorset and Edinburgh, while beautiful and historically significant in their own right, don't have the strong naval connection that Portsmouth does, nor do they house this particular ship. So, if you want to step aboard a piece of naval history and see Nelson's flagship, Portsmouth is the place to go.
