Skara Brae, located on the Orkney Islands off the north coast of Scotland, is a remarkably well-preserved Neolithic settlement, dating back to around 3180 BC to 2500 BC. What makes Skara Brae so significant is that it provides an unparalleled glimpse into the daily lives of people living in Britain during the late Stone Age. The village was accidentally discovered in 1850 after a severe storm stripped away the sand dunes that had protected it for millennia. The buildings, connected by covered passageways, offer insights into their homes, furniture, and tools. The other locations listed, St Helena, the Falkland Islands and Shetland, are not Neolithic sites. St Helena and the Falkland Islands are much more recent in terms of their historical significance, primarily associated with the age of exploration and later colonial history. Shetland has some prehistoric sites, but none as significant or well-preserved as Skara Brae for understanding late Stone Age domestic life.
