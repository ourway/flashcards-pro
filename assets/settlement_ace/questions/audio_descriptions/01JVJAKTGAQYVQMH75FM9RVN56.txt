Okay, let's break down why the followers of James II were called Jacobites. The key here is the name "James" itself. "Jacobus" is the Latin version of James, and the term "Jacobite" is derived directly from that Latin form. Now, James II reigned from 1685 to 1688, and he was a Catholic king in a predominantly Protestant country. This caused a lot of tension, and eventually, he was overthrown in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. However, that didn't end the story. Many people remained loyal to James II and his descendants, believing they were the rightful monarchs. These supporters, the Jacobites, wanted to restore the Stuart dynasty to the throne. They launched several rebellions, most notably in 1715 and 1745, to try and achieve this. So, while Cavaliers were associated with Charles I during the English Civil War, Roundheads were their opponents, and Quakers were a religious group, Jacobites were specifically those who backed James II and the Stuart claim after his deposition. Remembering the Latin connection between "James" and "Jacobus" can really help you nail this one.
