The rules around age limits for different activities in the UK can sometimes be confusing, especially when it comes to things like gambling. Historically, the age to participate in most forms of gambling, including lotteries, was 18. However, in 2021, the government changed the law specifically for the National Lottery and scratch cards, lowering the minimum age to 16. This change was made after a review of gambling laws, aiming to create a more consistent approach. While 18 remains the age for most gambling activities like casinos or online betting, the National Lottery was seen as a lower-risk activity, hence the change. So, if you're thinking about buying a lottery ticket or scratch card, remember that you can legally do so from the age of 16 in the UK. It's a relatively recent change, so it's understandable if people still think the age is 18, but the current law makes 16 the correct answer.
