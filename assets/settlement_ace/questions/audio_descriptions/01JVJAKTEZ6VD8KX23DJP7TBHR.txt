After World War II, Britain experienced significant immigration, largely driven by the need for labour to rebuild the country and staff the newly formed National Health Service. People came from across the Commonwealth, particularly from the Caribbean, India, and Pakistan. This influx of people dramatically changed the UK's demographic makeup. While immigration has continued and evolved since then, the impact of that initial post-war wave is what this question addresses. The figure of 10% reflects the proportion of the UK population who, at the time of the question, could trace their lineage back to a parent or grandparent who immigrated to the UK after the war. It's important to remember that this refers specifically to the *direct* impact of post-war immigration on family lineage. While other percentages might seem plausible, they don't accurately reflect the specific scope of the question, which focuses on the immediate generational impact of post-war immigration.
