The small claims procedure is designed as a straightforward, inexpensive way for individuals to resolve minor disputes in England and Wales without needing a lawyer. Think of it as the court system's version of a quick and easy fix for problems like unpaid debts, faulty goods, or minor property damage where the amount claimed is relatively small, usually under Â£10,000. The beauty of this procedure is its informality; the rules of evidence are relaxed, and the emphasis is on finding a fair resolution rather than strict legal technicalities. This allows ordinary people to represent themselves, saving on potentially hefty legal fees. Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) is a type of insurance policy, not a dispute resolution method. While you might make a claim on PPI, it doesn't help resolve disputes between parties. Similarly, "smart claim online" isn't an established legal procedure in the UK. The small claims procedure is the specific, established method designed for resolving minor disputes efficiently.
