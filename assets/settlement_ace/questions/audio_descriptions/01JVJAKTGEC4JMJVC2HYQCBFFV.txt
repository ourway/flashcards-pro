Okay, so after the English Civil War, things got pretty topsy-turvy in Britain. Charles I was executed in 1649, which was a huge deal â€“ a king being killed by his own people! This led to a period called the Interregnum, meaning "between reigns," where England was a republic, or a Commonwealth. Oliver Cromwell was the big cheese during this time. He was a military leader who had been instrumental in Parliament's victory. Now, while Cromwell held immense power and basically ruled the country, he never actually became king. He took the title of "Lord Protector" in 1653. There was actually a movement to offer him the crown later on, but he refused it. He knew that many of his supporters in the army and Parliament were strongly against the idea of a monarchy, so becoming king would have caused major problems. So, even though he acted like a king in many ways, he never officially took the title. That's why the statement is false. It's a common misconception because he was so powerful, but the title matters!
