The National Anthem, "God Save the Queen" (or "God Save the King" when there's a male monarch), is a symbol of the United Kingdom and the Crown. It's a patriotic song expressing loyalty to the monarch and the nation. Think of it like the Union Jack flag; it represents the UK whether the Queen is physically present or not. The anthem is played at official events, sporting matches, and public gatherings to show respect for the country and its head of state. It would be impractical and quite limiting if it could only be played when the monarch was physically present! Imagine a football match being cancelled because the Queen couldn't attend. The anthem's significance lies in its symbolic representation of the nation and its values, not the monarch's physical location. So, while it's a sign of respect to the monarch, its use isn't restricted to their presence.
