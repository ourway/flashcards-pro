The jury system in the UK has evolved over centuries, with its roots tracing back to the Magna Carta in 1215, which established the right to judgment by one's peers. The idea was to ensure fairness and impartiality in legal proceedings. While the exact number of jurors has varied throughout history, the standard jury size for serious criminal trials in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland is set at 12. This number is significant because it's considered large enough to represent a diverse range of perspectives and experiences, making it more likely that the verdict will be fair and just. Although juries can sometimes be smaller in certain civil cases, 12 remains the standard for criminal trials. So, when you think about the number of months in a year, that's the same number of people sitting on a standard jury!
