The jury system is a cornerstone of the British legal system, dating back centuries. Think of it as a fundamental right, ensuring trials are judged by ordinary citizens, not just state officials. Juries are empanelled to listen to the evidence presented by both sides in a court case â€“ the prosecution and the defence. This evidence can take many forms, from witness testimonies and documents to forensic reports and physical objects. The jurors are tasked with carefully considering all the evidence and arguments to determine the facts of the case. Their ultimate responsibility is to reach a verdict, deciding whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty (in criminal cases) or liable or not liable (in civil cases). So, the jury absolutely decides a verdict based on the evidence presented to them; that's the whole point of having a jury trial! Without this decision-making power, the jury system would be meaningless.
