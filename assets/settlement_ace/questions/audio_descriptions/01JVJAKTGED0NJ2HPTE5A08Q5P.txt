Okay, let's talk about the Anglican Church. To understand its origins, we need to rewind to the 16th century and the reign of King Henry VIII. Before this time, the Catholic Church held significant power in England. However, Henry wanted to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, to marry Anne Boleyn, hoping for a male heir. The Pope refused to grant him an annulment. This led to a major conflict. In the 1530s, specifically between 1532 and 1536, Henry VIII broke away from the Roman Catholic Church and established the Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church, with himself as its Supreme Head. This pivotal moment is known as the English Reformation. So, the 1530s is the correct answer because it marks the period when the legal and political steps were taken to create a separate, national church under the King's authority. The other dates are incorrect because they fall outside this crucial period of religious and political upheaval. It's interesting to note that while Henry's initial motivation was personal, the Reformation had far-reaching consequences for English society and religion.
