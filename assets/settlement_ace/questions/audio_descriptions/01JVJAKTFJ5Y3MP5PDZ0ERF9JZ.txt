Alright, let's talk about the early days of Scotland and how it became a unified kingdom. Back in the 9th century, the area we now know as Scotland was a patchwork of different groups, including the Picts and the Scots. The Vikings were a major threat, raiding coastal areas and causing disruption. Kenneth MacAlpin, also known as Coinneach mac Ailpein in Gaelic, was the King of the Scots. He's remembered for uniting the Picts and Scots into a single kingdom, effectively laying the foundation for what would become Scotland. He achieved this around 843 AD, and his dynasty played a crucial role in resisting Viking incursions and consolidating power. So, while figures like Cnut, Harold, and William the Conqueror were important rulers in other parts of Britain and Europe, they weren't the ones who unified Scotland against the Vikings. Kenneth MacAlpin gets the credit for that pivotal moment in Scottish history.
