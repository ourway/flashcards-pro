National parks in the UK are all about preserving the natural beauty and cultural heritage of some of the most stunning countryside areas. Think of them as designated zones where the focus is on protecting the landscape, wildlife, and historical features. The idea behind national parks, which really took off in the 20th century, is to balance conservation with allowing people to enjoy these spaces. So, while you might find some interesting buildings or geological formations within a national park, the defining characteristic is that they are specifically designated and managed as areas of protected countryside. It's not about creating artificial environments like greenhouses, or focusing solely on specific geological features or historical structures; it's the overall protection of the natural environment that makes a place a national park.
