Okay, let's break down the UK's relationship with the European Convention on Human Rights. The UK played a key role in drafting the Convention after World War II, aiming to prevent similar atrocities from happening again. However, it wasn't directly part of UK law for many years. This changed with the Human Rights Act of 1998. This Act essentially brought the rights enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law. It allows people in the UK to defend their rights in British courts, based on the Convention. So, while the UK isn't *in* the EU anymore, the Human Rights Act, which incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights, is still very much in force. That's why it's true that the European Convention on Human Rights is incorporated into UK law. It's a common misconception that leaving the EU automatically removed all European influences from UK law, but the Human Rights Act remains a separate piece of legislation.
