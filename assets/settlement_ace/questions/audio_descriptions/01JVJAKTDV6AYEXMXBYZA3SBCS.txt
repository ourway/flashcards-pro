Chequers, officially known as Chequers Court, is more than just a country house; it's the official country residence of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Think of it as the British equivalent of Camp David in the United States. The house, located in Buckinghamshire, was given to the nation in 1917 by Sir Arthur Lee and his wife, Ruth, with the intention of providing a retreat for the Prime Minister, a place to escape the pressures of London and entertain guests in a more informal setting. It's been in use since 1921. The idea was to ensure that whoever held the office of Prime Minister would always have a place to unwind and conduct business away from Downing Street. While "Country Retreat" is a general term, and "Windsor Palace" is a royal residence, Chequers is specifically designated for the Prime Minister. It's a symbol of the office and a place steeped in history, having hosted numerous important meetings and discussions over the decades.
