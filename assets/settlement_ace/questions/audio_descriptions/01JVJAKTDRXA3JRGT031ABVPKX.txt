The Commonwealth is a fascinating organization with a long history, evolving from the British Empire. It's a voluntary association of 54 independent and equal countries, not 27. Most, but not all, were formerly part of the British Empire. The key thing to remember is that the Queen, or now the King, is the symbolic head of the Commonwealth, a role that signifies the historical ties and shared values among member states. This doesn't mean the monarch is the head of state for all these countries; many are republics with their own presidents or have their own monarchs. The Commonwealth promotes cooperation in areas like trade, human rights, and democracy. So, while the Queen's role as symbolic head is accurate, the statement is false because it drastically underestimates the number of member states. It's a common mistake to think the Commonwealth is smaller than it actually is!
