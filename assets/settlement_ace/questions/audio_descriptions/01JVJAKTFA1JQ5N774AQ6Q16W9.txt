Okay, so the Leader of the Opposition becoming Prime Minister when their party wins a General Election is generally true, and here's why. In the UK's parliamentary system, we operate under a "first past the post" system. This means that the political party that wins the majority of seats in the House of Commons usually forms the government. The leader of that winning party then becomes the Prime Minister. Think of it like a relay race: the opposition party is waiting in the wings, and if the current governing party loses the public's confidence and, crucially, loses seats in Parliament, the opposition party is ready to step up and take the lead. While there can be exceptions, such as coalition governments where parties share power, the general rule is that the Leader of the Opposition is next in line for the top job if their party wins the election. It's a fundamental part of how power changes hands in British politics.
