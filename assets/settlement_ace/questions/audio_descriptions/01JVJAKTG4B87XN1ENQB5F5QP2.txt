The Glorious Revolution of 1688 was a pivotal moment in British history, fundamentally shifting the balance of power between the monarchy and Parliament. For decades leading up to it, tensions had been building between the Crown and Parliament, particularly concerning religious freedom and the extent of royal authority. When King James II, a Catholic, had a son, fears arose of a Catholic dynasty. This led leading English figures to invite William of Orange, the Protestant husband of James II's daughter Mary, to take the throne. William's arrival with an army led James II to flee, resulting in a bloodless coup. Crucially, William and Mary accepted the throne only after agreeing to the Declaration of Rights, later enshrined in the Bill of Rights in 1689. This document limited the power of the monarch, established parliamentary supremacy, and guaranteed certain rights and liberties to citizens. This acceptance of limitations on royal power in exchange for the crown is what marks the true beginning of the constitutional monarchy in Britain, where the monarch reigns but does not rule by absolute power. The other options are important historical events, but they didn't directly establish the constitutional monarchy in the same way.
