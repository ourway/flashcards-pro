Alfred the Great, who reigned from 871 to 899, is a pivotal figure in English history because he did more than just rule; he essentially saved Anglo-Saxon England from being completely overrun by the Vikings. During the 9th century, Viking raids and settlements were a major threat, and several Anglo-Saxon kingdoms fell. Alfred, however, managed to defend his kingdom of Wessex and then strategically expanded his influence. He defeated the Vikings in a decisive battle and negotiated a treaty that divided England, giving the Vikings control over the Danelaw in the north and east. Crucially, Alfred united the remaining Anglo-Saxon territories under his rule, laying the foundation for a unified England. He also implemented legal reforms, promoted literacy, and commissioned the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a vital historical source. So, while other monarchs like Henry VIII and William the Conqueror are significant in their own right, they came much later and weren't involved in the initial unification of Anglo-Saxon England against the Vikings. Henry V is also a later figure, famous for his victory at Agincourt against the French.
