The establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 marked a significant moment in Scottish history, representing a major shift towards greater self-governance. For nearly three centuries, since the Acts of Union in 1707, Scotland had been governed directly by the Parliament in Westminster. However, throughout the 20th century, there was growing support for a devolved Scottish assembly. A referendum in 1997 showed clear support for the creation of a Scottish Parliament. The Scotland Act was then passed in 1998, paving the way for the first elections to the new Parliament. So, while the Act was passed in 1998, the Scottish Parliament officially convened and began its work in 1999, making that the correct year. It's easy to get confused with the preceding years, but remember that 1999 is when the Parliament actually started operating and making laws for Scotland on devolved matters like education and healthcare.
