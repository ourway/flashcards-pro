To understand why someone who disrespects the law wouldn't be granted permanent residence, think about what permanent residence actually means. It's essentially the right to live in the UK indefinitely. The government needs to be confident that anyone granted this right will contribute positively to society and respect its rules. A key part of that is, of course, respecting the law. The UK immigration system prioritizes individuals who demonstrate good character and a willingness to integrate. Disrespect for the law, whether through criminal activity or other forms of disregard for the legal system, raises serious concerns about an individual's suitability for permanent residence. It suggests they may not uphold the values and principles of British society, which are based on the rule of law. So, while other factors are considered, a clear pattern of disrespecting the law is a significant barrier to obtaining permanent residence.
