Horse racing holds a significant place in British culture, steeped in history and tradition. The Grand National, first held in 1839 at Aintree near Liverpool, is a notoriously challenging steeplechase, famous for its demanding fences like Becher's Brook and The Chair. It's a true test of endurance for both horse and rider, attracting huge crowds and a massive television audience. Royal Ascot, on the other hand, is a highlight of the British social calendar, known for its strict dress code and association with the Royal Family. Founded by Queen Anne in 1711, it's a flat racing event showcasing some of the finest thoroughbreds in the world. While the Cup Final refers to the final match of a major football competition, and the Six Nations is a rugby tournament, neither are horse-racing events. The Grand National and Royal Ascot are specifically renowned horse races, making them the correct answer.
