When the Romans began their conquest of Britain in AD 43, many tribes resisted their rule. While several tribes put up a fight, Boudicca, the queen of the Iceni tribe in what is now Norfolk, stands out as a particularly fierce and memorable leader of the resistance. After her husband died, the Romans disregarded his will and seized Iceni lands, also flogging Boudicca and raping her daughters. This sparked a major uprising in AD 60 or 61. Boudicca led her forces to sack and burn Colchester (then the Roman capital of Britain), London, and Verulamium (modern-day St Albans), inflicting heavy losses on the Romans. Although the rebellion was ultimately crushed and Boudicca either died in battle or took her own life to avoid capture, her story became a symbol of British resistance to foreign invasion. The other tribes listed, while present in Roman Britain, aren't specifically remembered for being led by a single, iconic figure who mounted such a significant and destructive rebellion against Roman rule.
