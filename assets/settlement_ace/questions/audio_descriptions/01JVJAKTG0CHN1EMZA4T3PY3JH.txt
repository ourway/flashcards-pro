The European Convention on Human Rights, established in 1950, is a cornerstone of human rights protection in Europe. It outlines fundamental rights and freedoms that all member states, including the UK, are obligated to uphold. Think of it as a charter designed to prevent the atrocities witnessed during World War II from ever happening again. Two key pillars of this convention are the right to a fair trial and the right to liberty and security. The right to a fair trial ensures that everyone has access to a just legal process, including the presumption of innocence and the opportunity to defend themselves. The right to liberty and security protects individuals from arbitrary arrest and detention, ensuring that they are only deprived of their freedom according to the law. While the convention does address issues like forced labour and the protection of life, these are separate principles. The right to a fair trial and the right to liberty and security are explicitly listed as fundamental and foundational rights within the original text of the convention, making them the correct answer.
