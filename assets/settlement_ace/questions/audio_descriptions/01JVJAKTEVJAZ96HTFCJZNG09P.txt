The Tower of London, officially Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London, has a long and fascinating history dating back to William the Conqueror in the 11th century. It has served as a royal palace, a prison, an armoury, and even a zoo! But what makes it relevant to Beefeaters? Well, the Yeoman Warders, nicknamed "Beefeaters," are ceremonial guardians of the Tower. They've been guarding the Tower since Tudor times, specifically 1485. The origin of the nickname "Beefeater" is debated, but a popular theory suggests it comes from the fact that they were allowed to eat beef rations, a luxury in those days. So, while you might see people enjoying the London Eye or exploring Edinburgh Castle, the only place you'll find genuine Beefeaters in their distinctive uniforms is at the Tower of London, steeped in history and tradition. The Eden Project, while a great attraction, has nothing to do with royal history or Yeoman Warders.
