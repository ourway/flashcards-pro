The fight for women's rights in the UK was a long and arduous process, really gaining momentum in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. While many individuals and groups contributed, the Suffragettes are most famously associated with this movement. They were members of women's organisations in the late-19th and early-20th centuries who fought for the right to vote in public elections. The name "Suffragette" specifically refers to members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), founded in 1903. Led by Emmeline Pankhurst, they employed more radical and militant tactics, including protests, civil disobedience, and even hunger strikes, to draw attention to their cause. While the Quakers, Bishops, and Chartists all played roles in British history, they weren't primarily focused on women's suffrage. The Chartists, for example, were a working-class movement advocating for political reforms like universal male suffrage in the 1830s and 40s. So, when we think about who championed women's rights, the Suffragettes, with their direct and impactful activism, are the most accurate answer.
