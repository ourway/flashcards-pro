The Bronze Age, roughly from 2500 BC to 800 BC in Britain, gets its name because it was the period when people learned how to make bronze. Bronze is an alloy, a mixture of copper and tin, and it was a revolutionary material. Before bronze, tools and weapons were made of stone, which was much less durable and effective. The discovery of bronze allowed for stronger, sharper, and more versatile tools and weapons. This technological advancement led to significant changes in society, including new farming techniques, more effective warfare, and the development of trade networks. Because creating bronze required specific skills in mining, smelting, and metalworking, the people of the Bronze Age were notably skillful in working with metals. While they certainly used stone and wood for other purposes, it was their mastery of metalworking, specifically bronze, that defined the era. Glassworking, while an ancient craft, didn't become widespread in Britain until much later.
