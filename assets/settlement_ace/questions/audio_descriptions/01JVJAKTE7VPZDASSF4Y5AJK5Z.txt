The NSPCC, which stands for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, has a name that pretty much tells you everything you need to know! It was founded way back in 1884, a time when child protection laws were practically non-existent. The founders saw a desperate need to protect vulnerable children from abuse and neglect. So, from its very beginning, the NSPCC has been dedicated to safeguarding the well-being of children. They do this through a variety of services, including helplines like Childline, educational programs, and working directly with families and children in need. While other charities focus on different important causes like helping the elderly, protecting animals, or preserving the environment, the NSPCC's sole mission is to prevent cruelty to children, making them the primary group they serve.
