The title "Prince of Wales" has a long and fascinating history tied to the relationship between England and Wales. Originally, the title was held by native Welsh rulers. However, in 1282, Edward I of England conquered Wales. To solidify his control, he later bestowed the title "Prince of Wales" on his own son, Edward, in 1301. This was a symbolic act, asserting English dominance while also attempting to appease the Welsh people. Since then, the title has traditionally been given to the heir apparent to the British throne. So, as the eldest son of the Queen, Prince Charles was given the title Prince of Wales, continuing a tradition that's lasted for over 700 years. The other options, Prince of Kent, Hanover and Brunswick, are all titles that exist within the British aristocracy, but they aren't specifically linked to the heir apparent in the same way.
