Forced marriage is a serious human rights violation, and the introduction of Forced Marriage Protection Orders in 2008 across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland was a significant step in combating this issue. These orders are designed to protect individuals from being forced into marriage against their will. They can be used to prevent a marriage from taking place or to provide support to someone who has already been forced into a marriage. The key here is understanding that forced marriage is about coercion and lack of consent. While the Marriage Equality Act, which legalized same-sex marriage, is an important piece of legislation, it came later, in 2013, and addresses a different aspect of marriage rights. Similarly, the Divorce Reform Act, which made divorce easier, doesn't relate to the prevention of forced marriage. The Forced Marriage Protection Orders directly address the issue of protecting individuals from being compelled into a marriage they don't want, making it the correct answer. It's a sad reality that such measures are needed, but they provide a crucial legal safeguard.
