David Hume, a Scottish philosopher and historian of the 18th century, is renowned for his profound contributions to our understanding of human nature. He was a key figure in the Enlightenment, a period that emphasized reason and individualism. Humeâ€™s philosophical work delved into areas like morality, knowledge, and the human mind. He argued that our beliefs and actions are driven more by emotions and habits than by pure reason. His ideas challenged traditional views and had a lasting impact on philosophy and psychology. Now, while Adam Smith was a contemporary of Hume and also Scottish, his focus was primarily on economics, particularly the free market. Richard Arkwright and James Watt, on the other hand, were inventors instrumental in the Industrial Revolution, focusing on technological advancements rather than philosophical theories about human nature. Therefore, David Hume is the correct answer because his philosophical work directly addressed and significantly shaped theories about human nature.
