The UK's National Anthem is deeply rooted in British history and tradition. While the sentiment of wishing the monarch well is certainly present, the specific wording is crucial. The anthem originated as a patriotic song, first performed publicly in London in 1745, during a time when the country was facing a Jacobite rebellion aiming to restore the Stuart monarchy. The phrase "God Save the King" was a direct expression of loyalty to King George II and a plea for divine protection against his enemies. Over time, the song became associated with royal occasions and evolved into the de facto national anthem. When the monarch is female, the title and lyrics adapt to "God Save the Queen." So, while phrases like "Long Live the Queen" express a similar sentiment, they aren't the official title of the anthem itself. The power of the anthem lies in its historical association with the monarchy and its established wording, making "God Save the Queen" (or King) the only correct answer.
