Farming in Britain didn't just spring up overnight; it was introduced by people migrating from other parts of Europe. Around 6,000 years ago, during the Neolithic period, people from south-east Europe, specifically the area around modern-day Greece and the Balkans, began to arrive in Britain. These early farmers brought with them knowledge of cultivating crops like wheat and barley, and domesticating animals like sheep and cattle. This agricultural revolution gradually transformed Britain from a hunter-gatherer society to one based on settled farming communities. The reason it's south-east Europe and not other regions is because agriculture developed earlier in that part of the continent and then spread outwards. So, while there were people already living in Britain, it was the migrants from south-east Europe who introduced the farming techniques that fundamentally changed the way people lived.
