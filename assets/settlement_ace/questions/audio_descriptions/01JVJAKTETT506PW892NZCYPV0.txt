Alright, let's talk about the Romans in Britain. The Roman Empire was a massive force, and their influence stretched far and wide. They first popped over to Britain with Julius Caesar in 55 BC, but it wasn't a full-scale invasion and occupation just yet. The real deal started in 43 AD under Emperor Claudius. From then on, they set about conquering and building, establishing towns like Londinium (London), building Hadrian's Wall to keep out the Picts (ancestors of the Scottish), and generally making Britain a part of their empire. Now, the Roman Empire began to decline, and they started withdrawing their legions to defend other parts of their territory. By 410 AD, the Romans had pretty much left Britain to its own devices. So, if you do the math from 43 AD to 410 AD, you'll see that the Roman rule lasted for approximately 400 years. It wasn't a quick visit; it was a long-term occupation that left a lasting mark on British culture, language, and infrastructure.
