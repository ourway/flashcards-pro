The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 56 independent and equal countries. While it's true that many member states were indeed formerly part of the British Empire, it's not exclusively made up of them. The key here is understanding that the Commonwealth evolved from the Empire, but it also opened its doors to countries that have no historical ties to British rule. For example, Mozambique and Rwanda are both members of the Commonwealth, and neither were ever part of the British Empire. Mozambique, a former Portuguese colony, joined in 1995, and Rwanda, formerly under Belgian and German control, joined in 2009. They were admitted based on their commitment to the Commonwealth's values, such as democracy and human rights. So, while the historical link to the British Empire is significant, the Commonwealth today is more about shared values and cooperation than past colonial connections.
