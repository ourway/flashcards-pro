Life peers are appointed to the House of Lords to bring expertise and experience from various fields. While the Prime Minister recommends individuals for these peerages, the actual appointment is made by the monarch, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister. This process reflects the historical role of the monarch as the ultimate source of honours in the UK. Think of it like this: the Prime Minister suggests who should be honoured, but the monarch officially bestows the title. It's a tradition that dates back centuries, where the Crown held the power to create peerages. So, while the Prime Minister plays a crucial role in the selection process, the final decision and official appointment rest with the monarch. It's easy to think the Prime Minister directly appoints them, given their influence, but the formal power lies with the Crown.
