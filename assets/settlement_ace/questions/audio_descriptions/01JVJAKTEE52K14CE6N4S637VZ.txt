Okay, let's talk about the American Revolution. In the 18th century, Great Britain had established a number of colonies around the world, including thirteen on a particular continent. These colonies, while under British rule, developed their own distinct identities and increasingly resented British control, particularly over taxation and trade. Tensions grew until, in 1776, representatives from these colonies met and declared their independence, leading to the American Revolutionary War. Now, think about where the United States is located today. The thirteen colonies that formed the original United States were all located on the continent of North America. So, when you hear about the Declaration of Independence in 1776, you should immediately associate it with North America. It's a pivotal moment in the history of that continent, marking the birth of a new nation. The other continents listed – Asia, South America, and Africa – were not the primary locations of British colonies declaring independence in 1776.
