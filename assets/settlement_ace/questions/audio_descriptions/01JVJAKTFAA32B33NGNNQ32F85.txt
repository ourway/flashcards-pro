Okay, let's clarify the formation of Great Britain. It's easy to get confused with all the Acts and Unions in British history! The key thing to remember is that Great Britain was formed in 1707 through the Acts of Union, not the "Act of Governments." These Acts united the kingdoms of England and Scotland. Before 1707, England and Scotland were separate countries with their own parliaments, although they shared a monarch since 1603 when James VI of Scotland became James I of England. The Acts of Union dissolved both the English and Scottish Parliaments and created a new Parliament of Great Britain at Westminster. So, while government was certainly involved, the specific legislation was about uniting the kingdoms themselves, hence the "Acts of Union." Thinking about it as a union of crowns is a good way to remember the core concept.
