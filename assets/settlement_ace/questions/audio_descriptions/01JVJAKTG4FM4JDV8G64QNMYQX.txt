Okay, let's talk about King James and the Bible. When we think of King James, who reigned in the early 17th century, we often think of the King James Version of the Bible. Before his reign, there were various English translations of the Bible, but they were often considered inadequate or biased. King James wanted a new, authoritative version that would be acceptable to all parties within the Church of England. So, in 1604, he authorized a new translation project. A large committee of scholars worked for seven years, meticulously translating the Bible from Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts. The result, published in 1611, was the King James Version, also known as the Authorized Version. It was written in English, and its beautiful prose and widespread use had a massive impact on the English language and literature. It became the standard English Bible for centuries and is still widely read today. So, while other languages are important, King James is specifically tied to the English translation.
