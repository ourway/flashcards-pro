Saint Patrick's Day, celebrated annually on March 17th, is a cultural and religious holiday commemorating the death of Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland. He lived in the fifth century and is credited with bringing Christianity to Ireland. The day has evolved into a celebration of Irish culture in general. The date, March 17th, is significant because it's traditionally believed to be the day Saint Patrick died. While it began as a religious feast day, it's now widely celebrated with parades, traditional Irish music and dance, special foods, and of course, the wearing of green. So, remembering the festivities and the historical figure behind them makes it clear why the 17th of March is the correct answer. The other dates simply don't align with this specific cultural and historical celebration.
