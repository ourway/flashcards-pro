Domestic abuse, which includes violence against a partner, is a serious crime in the UK. It's crucial to understand that the law doesn't treat violence within a relationship any differently than violence between strangers. Historically, there might have been a perception that what happened within a family was a private matter, but that's absolutely not the case today. The police and courts take domestic abuse very seriously, and there are laws in place to protect individuals from harm, regardless of their relationship with the abuser. So, the idea that someone can't be prosecuted for being violent towards their partner is completely false. If someone is violent, they can be arrested, charged, and face prosecution in court. It's important to remember that everyone has the right to feel safe, and the law is there to protect that right, even within the home.
