Around 1400, the English court was transitioning away from French and back to English. For centuries after the Norman Conquest in 1066, French was the language of the ruling class, law, and administration. Think about it: William the Conqueror was from Normandy, in France! However, by the late 14th century, a sense of English national identity was growing. The Hundred Years' War with France also fueled this shift. The Statute of Pleading in 1362 mandated that court proceedings be conducted in English, although it was often recorded in Latin. By 1400, English was becoming increasingly common in government and among the nobility, even though some French influence remained. So, while French had been dominant for a long time, English was making a comeback and was the preferred language of the English court. German and Welsh were never languages of the English court.
