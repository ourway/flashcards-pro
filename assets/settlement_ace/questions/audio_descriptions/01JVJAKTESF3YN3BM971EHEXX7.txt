Civil law is all about sorting out disagreements between people or organizations. Think of it as the legal system's way of ensuring fairness when things go wrong in everyday life, like a neighbor dispute over a fence or a company breaking a contract. It's different from criminal law, which deals with offenses against society as a whole, like theft or assault. Criminal law aims to punish offenders, while civil law focuses on compensating the injured party. Canon law, on the other hand, is a set of religious laws, particularly associated with the Church. Common law is law developed by judges through decisions of courts and similar tribunals, rather than through legislative statutes or executive branch action. So, when individuals or groups have a disagreement, they turn to civil law to find a resolution and receive compensation for any damages.
