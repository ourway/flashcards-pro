The Crown Court handles the most serious criminal cases in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Think of it as the heavyweight champion of the court system. The name "Crown Court" itself is significant; it represents the monarch, who is the symbolic head of state and the embodiment of justice. These courts deal with indictable offences â€“ that is, crimes so severe they require a more formal and thorough trial process. This includes things like murder, manslaughter, rape, and armed robbery. A key feature of Crown Court trials is the presence of a jury, made up of 12 ordinary citizens, who decide whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. The judge, on the other hand, oversees the trial, ensures legal procedures are followed, and determines the sentence if the defendant is found guilty. Magistrates' Courts, by contrast, typically handle less serious offences, and don't usually involve a jury. So, when you hear about a major crime being tried before a judge and jury, it's almost certainly happening in the Crown Court.
