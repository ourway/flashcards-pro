Okay, let's clear up the confusion around 'The Planets' and its composer. While Sir Edward Elgar is undoubtedly a giant in British classical music, known for pieces like the 'Enigma Variations' and 'Pomp and Circumstance Marches', he didn't compose 'The Planets'. That honour belongs to Gustav Holst. Holst's 'The Planets', completed in 1916, is a seven-movement orchestral suite, with each movement named after a planet in our solar system and its corresponding astrological character â€“ Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and so on. It's a hugely influential and popular piece, known for its grandeur and evocative soundscapes. So, while Elgar was a prominent composer of his time, celebrated for his very British style, attributing 'The Planets' to him would be incorrect. Remembering Holst's name alongside 'The Planets' will help you avoid this common mistake.
