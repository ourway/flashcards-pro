Dunkirk is all about a desperate situation and an inspiring response during World War II. In May 1940, the German army had pushed Allied forces, including British soldiers, back to the beaches of Dunkirk in France. They were trapped, facing almost certain capture or death. The British government launched "Operation Dynamo," a daring plan to evacuate these troops. What makes Dunkirk so memorable is that it wasn't just the Royal Navy involved. Hundreds of privately owned civilian boats – fishing boats, pleasure cruisers, even lifeboats – sailed across the English Channel to help rescue the soldiers. This massive effort saved over 300,000 men. So, the two key events associated with Dunkirk are the large-scale rescue of those troops and the crucial role played by those "little ships" that came to their aid. The D-Day landings, while also a pivotal WWII event, happened four years later in Normandy, and the Fall of Singapore was a major defeat for the Allies in the Far East, unrelated to the events at Dunkirk.
