The UK government operates through a cabinet system, where senior ministers, typically heads of government departments, come together regularly to discuss and decide on key policy issues. This structured meeting allows for coordinated governance and ensures that different departments are aligned on important matters. While the Prime Minister can call meetings as needed, the standard practice is to hold these cabinet meetings weekly. This frequency allows ministers to stay informed on current events, debate policy options, and make timely decisions. Meeting monthly or yearly would simply be too infrequent to effectively manage the day-to-day business of running the country. Daily meetings, on the other hand, would be impractical and unnecessary for most issues. The weekly schedule strikes a balance, providing enough time for ministers to gather information and prepare for discussions, while also ensuring that decisions are made promptly.
