Okay, so after the Romans packed up and left Britain around 410 AD, a power vacuum was created. The local Celtic Britons, who had been under Roman rule for centuries, were vulnerable. This opened the door for Germanic tribes from mainland Europe to start migrating and invading. The two main groups who came over were the Anglo-Saxons and the Jutes. The Jutes are believed to have come from the Jutland peninsula, which is now part of Denmark, and they settled mainly in Kent. The Anglo-Saxons, hailing from what is now northern Germany, established kingdoms across much of England. These groups weren't a unified force, but rather a collection of tribes who eventually formed what we know as Anglo-Saxon England. Now, the Vikings came much later, starting around the 8th century, and the Normans arrived in 1066 with William the Conqueror. The Celts were already there, so they weren't invaders in this context. So, the Jutes and the Anglo-Saxons were the primary groups filling the void after the Romans left.
