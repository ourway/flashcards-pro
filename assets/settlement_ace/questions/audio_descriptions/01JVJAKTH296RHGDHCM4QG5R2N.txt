The British monarchy's role can be a little confusing because of its long history. Centuries ago, the monarch held significant political power, directly ruling the country and making key decisions. Think back to figures like Henry VIII or Queen Elizabeth I â€“ they were very much in charge! However, over time, power shifted towards Parliament, particularly after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the Bill of Rights in 1689. These events firmly established parliamentary sovereignty, meaning that the elected Parliament holds the ultimate authority to make laws and govern. Today, the monarch is a symbolic head of state. They perform important ceremonial duties, like opening Parliament and approving legislation, but they act on the advice of the government. So, while the Queen or King is a very important figurehead, they don't actually exercise direct rule over the UK. That's why the statement is false. It's easy to think the monarchy still has direct power because of its historical significance, but the reality is that the elected government runs the country.
