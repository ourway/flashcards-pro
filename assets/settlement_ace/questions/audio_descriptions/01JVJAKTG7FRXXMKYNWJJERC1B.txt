The Medieval Period in Britain, often called the Middle Ages, is a long stretch of history that begins with the Norman Conquest in 1066. William the Conqueror's victory at the Battle of Hastings marked a huge turning point, bringing Norman French culture and governance to England. Now, pinpointing the *end* of such a broad period is tricky, but historians generally agree that it concludes around 1485. This is because the Battle of Bosworth Field took place in that year, marking the end of the Wars of the Roses â€“ a bloody, decades-long civil war between the Houses of Lancaster and York for the English throne. Henry Tudor's victory at Bosworth and his subsequent crowning as King Henry VII ushered in the Tudor dynasty, a new era of relative stability and a shift away from the feudal structures that characterized much of the Medieval Period. While some might think of earlier dates like 1400 because of events like the Black Death, or 1455 when the Wars of the Roses began, 1485 is the more widely accepted marker for the end of the Middle Ages in British history.
