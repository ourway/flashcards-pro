The UK is made up of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and each has its own distinct landmarks. The Giant's Causeway is a unique geological formation found on the coast of Northern Ireland. It's made up of about 40,000 interlocking basalt columns, the result of an ancient volcanic eruption. Legend has it that the causeway was built by a giant, hence the name! Now, let's look at the other options. Big Ben, the iconic clock tower, is part of the Palace of Westminster in London, England. Snowdonia is a stunning national park located in Wales, known for its mountains and hiking trails. The Eden Project, with its famous biomes, is a modern botanical garden in Cornwall, England. So, while all are great UK landmarks, only the Giant's Causeway calls Northern Ireland home.
