The Scottish clan system was traditionally strongest in the Highlands. This region's rugged terrain and remote location fostered a sense of independence and made it difficult for the central government to exert control. Clans were essentially extended families, each with its own territory, chief, and traditions. When Bonnie Prince Charlie, also known as Charles Edward Stuart, launched his Jacobite rebellion in 1745 to reclaim the British throne for his father, many Highland clans rallied to his cause. They saw him as a legitimate monarch and an opportunity to restore their traditional way of life, which was threatened by the increasing influence of the British government. While some clans from other regions did participate, the vast majority of the Jacobite army was made up of Highland clansmen. Places like Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Galloway were more urbanized and generally supported the government. So, the Highlands were the heartland of the Jacobite rising.
