Okay, let's talk about British banknotes. When you're thinking about the highest value note in circulation, it's easy to get confused because denominations have changed over time. Historically, there were even higher value notes, but today, the £50 note is the largest denomination you'll find in general circulation. The Bank of England issues these notes, and they feature prominent figures from British history. Currently, the £50 note features Alan Turing, the famous codebreaker. While you might think a higher value like £70 or £100 exists, those aren't standard. The £20 note is also common, but it's obviously a lower value. So, remember, when you think of the highest value British banknote you're likely to encounter, picture that £50 note.
