Okay, let's talk about national parks in the UK. National Parks aren't like theme parks; they're protected areas of beautiful countryside where people live and work. The idea behind them is to conserve the natural environment and allow people to enjoy these spaces. England was first, establishing its first National Park, the Peak District, in 1951. Wales followed soon after. Scotland was a bit later, with its first, Loch Lomond and The Trossachs, being designated in 2002. Now, the UK has a total of 15 national parks: 10 in England, 3 in Wales, and 2 in Scotland. So, if you were thinking of a smaller number, like 5 or 8, you might be underestimating the sheer amount of stunning landscape the UK protects. And 25? Well, that would be amazing, but we're not quite there yet! Remember, 15 is the magic number for national parks across England, Wales, and Scotland.
