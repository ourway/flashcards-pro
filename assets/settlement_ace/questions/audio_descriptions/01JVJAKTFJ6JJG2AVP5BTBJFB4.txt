The UK citizenship pledge is a formal promise new citizens make, and it's carefully worded to emphasize the core values of British society. Think of it as a commitment to integrate into the UK's way of life. The pledge isn't just about obeying laws; it's about embracing the principles that underpin the country. After declaring loyalty to the UK and respecting its rights and freedoms, the next logical step is to affirm your commitment to upholding its democratic values. This highlights the importance of democracy in the UK's identity and the responsibility of citizens to protect it. While fulfilling duties and obligations and observing the laws are certainly important aspects of being a British citizen, they come later in the pledge. The specific order is designed to build from loyalty and respect to democratic values, then to the practical aspects of citizenship.
