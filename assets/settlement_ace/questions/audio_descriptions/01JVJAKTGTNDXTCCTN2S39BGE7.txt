Mothering Sunday has a fascinating history, actually. It's not just a commercial holiday like some might think. It evolved from a Christian tradition where people would return to their 'mother church' – the main church or cathedral of their area – once a year. This pilgrimage often took place during Lent, the period leading up to Easter. Over time, this custom became linked with honouring mothers, as people were reunited with their families during this visit. Because Lent is tied to Easter, and Easter's date changes each year based on the lunar calendar, Mothering Sunday also moves. It always falls on the fourth Sunday of Lent, which is definitely not in June! June is much later in the year, firmly in summertime. So, while it's lovely to think of celebrating mothers in the sunshine, Mothering Sunday is a spring festival, usually in March or sometimes late February, depending on when Easter falls.
