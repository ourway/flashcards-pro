Civil law is all about resolving disagreements between individuals or organizations, rather than punishing crimes against society as a whole, which is the realm of criminal law. Think of it as settling scores fairly. Unfair dismissal, where an employee believes they were wrongly fired, or discrimination in the workplace, where someone faces prejudice, are classic examples. Similarly, disputes between landlords and tenants, perhaps over repairs or rent, fall squarely into civil law. These situations involve one party claiming another has violated their rights or agreements. On the other hand, things like murder, theft, and assault are considered crimes against society. The state prosecutes these offenses because they break laws designed to protect everyone. While racial crime is abhorrent, it's still prosecuted under criminal law because it violates public order and safety, not just a private agreement. So, civil law is about private disputes, not public offenses.
