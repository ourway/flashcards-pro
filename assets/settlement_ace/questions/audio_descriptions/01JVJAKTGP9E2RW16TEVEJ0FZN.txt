Mary Peters' story is a great example of how sporting achievements can lead to national recognition. While all the names listed are accomplished British women, the key here is the year 2000. Mary Peters, a Northern Irish athlete, won a gold medal in the pentathlon at the 1972 Munich Olympics. This was a huge moment for British sport, and she became a national hero. However, her contributions didn't stop there. She dedicated much of her life to promoting sport and tourism in Northern Ireland. In recognition of her lifetime achievements and service, she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the year 2000. While Jayne Torvill, Dame Kelly Holmes, and Dame Ellen MacArthur are all incredibly accomplished and were also later honoured with damehoods, their investitures occurred in different years. So, while you might be tempted to pick one of the other famous names, remembering the specific timeline is crucial for this question.
