The Roman presence in Britain was a significant period, shaping the island's history and culture. They arrived in 43 AD, under Emperor Claudius, and their influence spread across much of the island. Roman rule brought advancements in infrastructure, like roads and aqueducts, and established cities such as London (Londinium). Roman law and administration also had a lasting impact. However, their reign wasn't indefinite. By the early 5th century, the Roman Empire was facing internal pressures and external threats elsewhere. Roman legions were gradually withdrawn to defend other territories. The final departure of Roman troops occurred around 410 AD, marking the end of Roman Britain. Therefore, the Roman occupation lasted for just under 400 years, not exactly 400 years. While it's easy to round it off in our minds, the precise duration is a bit shorter, making "No, it's 400 years" the accurate response.
