The Olympic Games are a major international sporting event held every four years, and the UK has a proud history of hosting them. Thinking about the 20th century, the first time London hosted the Games was in 1908. This was actually a bit of a last-minute thing! Rome was originally supposed to host, but they had financial difficulties, and London stepped in. Then, after the Second World War, London hosted the Olympics again in 1948. These games were nicknamed the "Austerity Games" because Britain was still recovering from the war, and resources were limited. It's easy to remember because it was a time of rebuilding and hope. So, the correct answer is 1908 and 1948. You might be tempted to think of other years, but the UK didn't host in 1916 or 1928. The 1916 Olympics were actually cancelled due to World War I.
