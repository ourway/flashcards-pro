Jane Austen is one of England's most beloved novelists, famous for her witty social commentary and insightful portrayals of English middle-class life during the Regency period, roughly from 1811 to 1820. Her novels often explore themes of love, marriage, and social status. While Charles Dickens, the author of *Oliver Twist* and *Great Expectations*, wrote about the Victorian era, which came later, and James Bond is a fictional character created by Ian Fleming in the 20th century, Jane Austen's works are distinctly from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. *Sense and Sensibility*, published in 1811, perfectly encapsulates Austen's style. It tells the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, who represent the contrasting qualities of reason and emotion, hence "sense" and "sensibility." The novel explores how they navigate love and society, making it a key example of Austen's exploration of social dynamics and personal relationships.
