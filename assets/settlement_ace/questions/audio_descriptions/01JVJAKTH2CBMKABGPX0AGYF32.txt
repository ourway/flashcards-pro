The year 1665 is etched in British history because of the Great Plague, a devastating outbreak of bubonic plague. While other areas of the country were affected, London bore the brunt of the epidemic. Think of it as a major historical event concentrated in the capital. The plague spread rapidly through the city's densely populated areas, causing widespread panic and death. The death toll was staggering, estimated to be around 100,000 people â€“ a significant portion of London's population at the time. The plague is often associated with Charles II's reign because it occurred during his time as king. While other cities and regions certainly experienced hardship during this period, the scale of the devastation in London was unparalleled, making it the correct answer. The other options, while real places in the UK, simply weren't the epicentre of this particular historical tragedy.
