Iona is a tiny island off the coast of Scotland with huge historical and religious significance. In 563 AD, St Columba, also known as Colmcille, arrived there from Ireland with a group of followers. He established a monastery that became a major centre for the spread of Christianity throughout Scotland and northern England. This monastery played a crucial role in converting the Picts to Christianity. Iona became a place of pilgrimage and learning, and it's believed that the Book of Kells, a beautifully illuminated manuscript of the Gospels, was partially created there. So, while St. Andrew is the patron saint of Scotland, St. Patrick is associated with Ireland, and St. Augustine with Canterbury, it was St. Columba who specifically founded that influential monastery on the Isle of Iona, making him the correct answer.
