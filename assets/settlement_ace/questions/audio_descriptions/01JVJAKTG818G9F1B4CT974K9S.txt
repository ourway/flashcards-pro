The term "judiciary" refers to the branch of government responsible for interpreting and applying the law. Think of it as the system of courts and judges that ensures laws are followed and disputes are resolved fairly. The judiciary is a crucial part of any democratic society, acting as an independent check on the power of the executive and legislative branches. It's a collective term, encompassing all judges from the highest courts down to local tribunals within a specific country. So, when you need a single word to describe all the judges in a nation, "the judiciary" is the correct and most encompassing term. While juries are involved in legal proceedings, they are groups of citizens, not judges. Magistrates and district judges are specific types of judges, but "the judiciary" is the umbrella term that includes them all.
