Okay, let's talk about the UK's population in 1901. This was a really interesting period in British history. The Victorian era had just ended, and the country was on the cusp of huge social and technological changes. Think about it: the Industrial Revolution had already transformed Britain into a global powerhouse, and this led to a massive population boom, especially in urban areas. People were moving from the countryside to cities in search of work. So, while 20 million might sound like a lot, it's actually way off the mark for 1901. The actual population was closer to double that, around 40 million people. That's why the statement is false. It's easy to underestimate the population size at this time because we often think of earlier periods as being less populated, but the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw significant growth in the UK.
