Okay, let's break down the question about the proportion of the UK population with a grandparent born outside the UK. Immigration has shaped the UK for centuries, but large-scale immigration really took off after the Second World War, particularly from countries in the Commonwealth. Think about the arrival of the Empire Windrush in 1948, bringing people from the Caribbean. Over the following decades, people also came from South Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world. Now, while immigration has had a significant impact, it's important to remember that the UK has a long history and a large established population. So, when we consider grandparents, we're talking about people who were mostly born before this period of large-scale immigration really took hold. This means that the percentage of people with a grandparent born overseas, while notable, is actually relatively small. The correct answer is 10% because it reflects the reality that while the UK is a diverse nation, the majority of people have deeper roots within the country itself. The other options might seem plausible if you overestimate the impact of recent immigration on older generations.
