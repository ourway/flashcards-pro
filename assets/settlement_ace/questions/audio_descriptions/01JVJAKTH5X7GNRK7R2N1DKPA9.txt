Okay, let's talk about juries in Scotland. The legal systems in the UK can be a little confusing because they're not all the same! England and Wales share one system, but Scotland has its own distinct legal framework, and Northern Ireland has another. One key difference is the size of juries. In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, a jury usually has 12 members. However, in Scotland, the number is 15. This difference goes back centuries and reflects the unique development of Scots law. So, when you're asked about jury size specifically in Scotland, remember that extra three makes all the difference. It's also interesting to note that in Scottish criminal trials, a simple majority isn't enough for a guilty verdict; it requires at least eight jurors to agree. This is different from England, where a majority of 10 out of 12 is sufficient. So, while 12 might seem like a tempting answer because it's the standard elsewhere in the UK, always remember that Scotland does things a little differently!
