General Elections in the UK determine who will form the next government, and they're a cornerstone of British democracy. The reason they happen every five years is due to the Parliament Act of 1911. Before this act, Parliament could last up to seven years, but there was a push to make the government more accountable to the people. So, the Act limited the maximum life of a Parliament to five years. This means that after an election, the government can stay in power for a maximum of five years before another election must be held. While the Prime Minister can call an election earlier than five years, they can't delay it beyond that point. This five-year rule ensures that the public has a regular opportunity to choose their representatives and shape the direction of the country. It's a key part of how the UK's political system works.
