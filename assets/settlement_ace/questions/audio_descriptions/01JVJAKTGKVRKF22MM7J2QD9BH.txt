The story of early technology is often told through the materials people used. The Stone Age, as you might guess, was all about stone tools â€“ think axes and arrowheads. Then came the Bronze Age, around 2500 BC, when people discovered how to mix copper and tin to make bronze, a much stronger metal. This allowed for better tools and weapons, and even decorative items. But iron was a game-changer. It's much more abundant than copper or tin, but it's also harder to work with because it requires much higher temperatures to smelt. It wasn't until around 600 BC that people in Britain really mastered ironworking. This marked the start of the Iron Age, bringing with it stronger, more durable tools and weapons that significantly impacted agriculture, warfare, and daily life. So, while the Stone Age and Bronze Age were important steps, the Iron Age is specifically when iron tools and weapons became widespread.
