Okay, let's talk about the Prime Minister's role. In the UK's parliamentary system, we don't directly elect the Prime Minister. Instead, we vote for a Member of Parliament, or MP, to represent our local area in the House of Commons. The political party that wins the majority of these seats in a general election then gets to form the government. The leader of that winning party automatically becomes the Prime Minister. Think of it like this: the party with the most MPs is like the winning team, and their leader is the captain â€“ the Prime Minister. So, while the Prime Minister obviously deals with the economy and many other important issues, and while the leader of the opposition party is a very important role in holding the government to account, the core reason someone becomes Prime Minister is because they lead the party that can command a majority in the House of Commons.
