The right to vote is a cornerstone of democracy, and in the UK, that right is tied to age. Historically, the voting age was actually much higher. For a long time, it was 21, reflecting a belief that younger adults weren't mature enough to make informed political decisions. However, during the 20th century, there was increasing pressure to lower the voting age, arguing that if 18-year-olds could serve in the military and pay taxes, they should also have a say in who governs them. This movement gained momentum in the 1960s, a time of significant social change. The Representation of the People Act in 1969 finally lowered the voting age to 18. So, while 16 might seem like a responsible age to some, and 21 was the historical precedent, the current minimum age to vote in a General Election in the UK is 18.
