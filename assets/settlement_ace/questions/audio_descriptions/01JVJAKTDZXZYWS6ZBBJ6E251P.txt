Think about the map of Britain after the Romans left. The Anglo-Saxons, tribes from Germanic lands, gradually took control of much of what is now England. However, they weren't able to conquer *all* of Britain. Scotland, with its mountainous terrain and fierce Pictish and Scottish tribes, remained largely independent. The Anglo-Saxons did make some inroads, but never fully controlled the region north of what would become the Anglo-Scottish border. Similarly, Wales, another area with difficult terrain, was populated by Celtic Britons who fiercely resisted Anglo-Saxon expansion. While there were battles and skirmishes, the Welsh kingdoms maintained their independence and their unique Celtic culture and language. So, while Anglo-Saxon influence was significant in England, Scotland and Wales successfully avoided being fully brought under their rule, preserving their own distinct identities. It's a testament to their resilience and the geographical challenges the Anglo-Saxons faced.
