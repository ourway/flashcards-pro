British parliamentary democracy is built on the idea of representation, and that extends beyond just the major political parties. While the vast majority of Members of Parliament belong to parties like the Conservatives, Labour, or the Liberal Democrats, it's absolutely possible for individuals to stand for election and win as "independents." These candidates don't align themselves with any particular party and often campaign on local issues or specific platforms. Historically, independent MPs haven't been hugely numerous, but they play a vital role in ensuring diverse voices are heard in Parliament. They can hold established parties accountable and bring unique perspectives to debates. So, the idea that all MPs must belong to a party simply isn't true; independent candidates offer an alternative route to representing the people.
