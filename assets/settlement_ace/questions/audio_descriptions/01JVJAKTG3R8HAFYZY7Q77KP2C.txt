The Huguenots were French Protestants during the 16th and 17th centuries. This was a period of intense religious conflict in Europe, following the Protestant Reformation which began in 1517. People began to question some of the teachings of the Catholic Church, and new Protestant denominations emerged. In France, those who followed these Protestant teachings were called Huguenots. They faced persecution for their beliefs, including massacres and forced conversions. One of the most famous events was the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572, where thousands of Huguenots were killed. The Edict of Nantes in 1598 granted them some religious freedom, but this was later revoked in 1685, leading many Huguenots to flee France and seek refuge in countries like Britain. So, because the Huguenots were part of the Protestant movement that broke away from the Catholic Church, Protestantism is the correct answer.
