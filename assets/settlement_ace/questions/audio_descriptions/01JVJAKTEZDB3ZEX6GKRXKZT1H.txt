2012 was a huge year for sports in London, but it's important to remember the specific events that took place. While the Commonwealth Games are a major international multi-sport event, they weren't held in London that year. Similarly, the Cricket World Cup and the European Football Championship are significant tournaments, but neither took place in London in 2012. The big event that London hosted in 2012, following directly after the Olympics, was the Paralympic Games. This is a major international multi-sport event involving athletes with a range of disabilities. The London 2012 Paralympic Games were a massive success, showcasing incredible athletic talent and promoting inclusivity. So, while the other options are all important sporting events, the Paralympic Games are the correct answer because they were specifically held in London in 2012.
