Visiting the UK Parliament, also known as the Houses of Parliament, is generally free for the public. The UK Parliament is a symbol of democracy and open to all, and it's important to understand that access is usually free of charge. While there might be special events or tours that require a ticket, simply visiting the public galleries to observe debates in the House of Commons or the House of Lords doesn't usually cost anything. This tradition of free access reinforces the idea that Parliament is accountable to the people. So, while you might encounter paid tours or events, the general principle is that observing Parliament in action is a right, not a privilege requiring payment. Be aware that security checks are in place, and it's wise to check the Parliament website for the latest information on opening times and any specific requirements before your visit.
