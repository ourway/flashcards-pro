Following the Norman Conquest in 1066, England experienced a significant linguistic shift. William the Conqueror and his Norman lords spoke Norman French, which heavily influenced the English language. Many words related to law, government, and high society have Norman French origins. The word "park" is a great example. It comes from the Old French word "parc," which referred to an enclosed area for animals, often a hunting ground for the nobility. Norman lords established these "parcs" in England, and the term naturally entered the English vocabulary. On the other hand, words like "apple," "cow," and "summer" have Anglo-Saxon roots, predating the Norman invasion. These words were part of the everyday vocabulary of the common people, and less influenced by the language of the new ruling class. So, while an apple might have been enjoyed in a park, the park itself owes its name to the Normans.
