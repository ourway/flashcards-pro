The Glorious Revolution, which took place in 1688, gets its name not from economic prosperity, but from the relatively bloodless way in which power shifted. Think of "glorious" meaning "remarkable" or "triumphant" in terms of political achievement, rather than financial gain. The key event was when William of Orange, invited by prominent English figures, arrived in England and James II fled to France. This avoided a large-scale civil war. The main outcome was the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, limiting the power of the monarch and strengthening the role of Parliament. The Bill of Rights in 1689 further cemented these changes, guaranteeing certain rights and liberties. So, while the period certainly had its economic aspects, the term "Glorious Revolution" specifically highlights the peaceful and politically significant transfer of power that shaped the future of British governance. It's easy to get confused if you're thinking about economic growth, but the "glory" here is all about the peaceful political shift.
