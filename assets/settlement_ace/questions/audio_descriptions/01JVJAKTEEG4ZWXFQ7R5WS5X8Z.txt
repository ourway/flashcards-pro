The Huguenots were French Protestants who faced severe persecution in France, particularly during the 16th and 17th centuries. France was predominantly Catholic, and the Huguenots, who followed a form of Protestantism influenced by John Calvin, were often targeted with violence and discrimination. The Edict of Nantes in 1598 granted them some religious freedoms, but this was later revoked in 1685 by Louis XIV, leading to a mass exodus. Seeking refuge from religious persecution, many Huguenots fled to countries like England, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Prussia. Britain, being a Protestant country, offered them asylum. The Huguenots brought valuable skills and trades with them, particularly in weaving, clockmaking, and silversmithing, contributing significantly to the British economy and culture. The other options, Roundheads, Cavaliers, and Jacobites, are related to British political and religious conflicts, but not to French refugees seeking asylum. Roundheads and Cavaliers were on opposing sides of the English Civil War, while Jacobites supported the restoration of the Stuart monarchy.
