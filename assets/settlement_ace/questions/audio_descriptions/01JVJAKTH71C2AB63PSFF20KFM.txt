Big Ben is actually the nickname for the Great Bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster, also known as the Houses of Parliament. The Palace of Westminster serves as the meeting place for both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two chambers of the UK Parliament. It's a grand, iconic building on the bank of the River Thames in London. Now, you might think of Buckingham Palace because it's where the Queen lives, or the Tower of London because it's a famous landmark, or even Trafalgar Square because it's a central London location. However, Big Ben is specifically part of the clock tower that's attached to the Houses of Parliament, where laws are debated and passed. So, when you think of Big Ben, remember it's the sound of democracy and law-making in the UK.
