George Frederick Handel was a hugely influential Baroque composer, and his connection to the British monarchy is a key part of his story. He was born in Germany, but he became a British subject in 1727. Before King George I even took the throne in 1714, Handel had worked for him when George was still the Elector of Hanover. When George became King of Great Britain, Handel followed him to London and became a central figure in the royal court's musical life. He composed extensively for the King, including the famous "Water Music" suite, which was supposedly performed on a barge on the River Thames. This close relationship and his official role at court make Handel the correct answer. The other composers listed – Walton, Britten, and Elgar – were all significant British composers, but they lived and worked much later, primarily in the 20th century, so they wouldn't have had any association with King George I.
