Henry VIII's reign in the 16th century was a pivotal time in English history, largely because of his dramatic break with the Roman Catholic Church. The key reason behind this seismic shift was his desperate desire for a male heir to secure the Tudor dynasty. He was married to Catherine of Aragon, but after many years, she had only produced a daughter, Mary. Henry became convinced that God was displeased with him for marrying his brother's widow, and he sought an annulment from the Pope. However, the Pope, under pressure from Catherine's nephew, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, refused. Frustrated and determined, Henry took matters into his own hands. He declared himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England, effectively creating a new church independent of Rome. This allowed him to grant himself a divorce from Catherine and marry Anne Boleyn, hoping for a son. While Henry certainly gained control over religious matters as a result, and his actions did lead to a unique religious identity for England over time, the initial and driving force was undeniably his quest to end his marriage to Catherine of Aragon.
