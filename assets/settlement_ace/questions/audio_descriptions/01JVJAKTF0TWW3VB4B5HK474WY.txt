Okay, let's talk about the first Archbishop of Canterbury. To understand why St. Augustine holds this title, we need to rewind to the late 6th century. At that time, England was largely pagan. Pope Gregory the Great in Rome decided to send a mission to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. He chose Augustine, who was the prior of a monastery in Rome, to lead this important mission. Augustine and his monks arrived in Kent in 597 AD. King Æthelberht of Kent, whose wife Bertha was already a Christian, welcomed them. Augustine successfully converted Æthelberht and many of his subjects. As a result of his success in establishing Christianity in England, Augustine was appointed as the first Archbishop of Canterbury in 597 AD. Canterbury became the center of the Church in England, a position it still holds today. While St. Patrick is famous for his missionary work in Ireland, and St. Columba for his work in Scotland, and St. David is the patron saint of Wales, none of them were ever the Archbishop of Canterbury. That title belongs solely to St. Augustine.
