Dame Ellen MacArthur is practically synonymous with sailing in the UK! Her incredible achievements in solo, long-distance sailing captured the nation's imagination. Think back to the early 2000s, when she became a household name. She didn't just sail; she conquered oceans, often single-handedly. In 2001, she came second in the Vend√©e Globe, a single-handed, non-stop round-the-world yacht race. Then, in 2005, she broke the world record for the fastest solo circumnavigation of the globe. This feat took her just over 71 days! So, while she might have needed to be athletic, and cycling or swimming are great for fitness, her fame is directly linked to her incredible feats on the water. It's her sailing accomplishments that cemented her place in British sporting history.
