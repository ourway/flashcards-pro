Alfred the Great, who reigned from 871 to 899, is the English king renowned for his successful defense against the Vikings. During the 9th century, Viking raids and invasions were a constant threat to Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Alfred, king of Wessex, faced a particularly formidable challenge. Instead of succumbing, he strategically fought back, most notably at the Battle of Edington in 878. This victory led to a treaty that divided England, with the Vikings controlling the Danelaw in the north and east, and Alfred ruling the south. Alfred wasn't just a warrior; he was also a shrewd negotiator and a patron of learning, promoting literacy and codifying laws. While William the Conqueror famously defeated the English at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, he was a Norman, not an English king fighting Vikings. King Harold was defeated *by* William the Conqueror, and Robert the Bruce was a Scottish king who fought for Scottish independence from England much later, in the 14th century. So, Alfred's direct and successful opposition to the Vikings is why he's remembered as the king who stood against them.
