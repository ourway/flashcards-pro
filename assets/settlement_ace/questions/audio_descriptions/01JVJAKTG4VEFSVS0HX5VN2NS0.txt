Maiden Castle isn't just any old pile of rocks; it's one of the largest and most complex Iron Age hillforts in Europe, and it's located in Dorset. Think of hillforts as the fortified towns of their time, built for defense and sometimes as centers of trade and community. Maiden Castle's history stretches back thousands of years, with evidence of occupation as early as the Neolithic period, long before the Romans even thought about invading. The Iron Age inhabitants really ramped things up, creating massive earthworks and ditches that are still impressive today. While Wiltshire also has its share of ancient sites like Stonehenge and Avebury, and Berkshire is known for Windsor Castle, neither can claim Maiden Castle. Lothian, being in Scotland, is geographically too far north. So, if you're looking to explore this incredible example of Iron Age engineering, you'll need to head to the beautiful county of Dorset.
