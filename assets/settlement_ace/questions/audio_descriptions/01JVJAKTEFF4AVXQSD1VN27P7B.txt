During the tumultuous English Civil War in the 17th century, loyalties were sharply divided between the monarchy and Parliament. King Charles I believed in the divine right of kings, meaning he thought his authority came directly from God. Those who supported him and his royal prerogative were known as Cavaliers. The term "Cavalier" originally referred to a mounted soldier or knight, and it became a somewhat romanticized label for those who were loyal to the King. They often came from the aristocracy and gentry. On the other side were the Roundheads, supporters of Parliament, who got their name from their closely cropped hair, a contrast to the long, fashionable wigs of the Cavaliers. So, because the question is asking about supporters of King Charles I, the answer is Cavaliers. The Luddites were 19th-century textile workers who protested against new machinery, and the Levellers were a political movement during the Civil War advocating for social and political equality, but neither were directly associated with supporting the King.
