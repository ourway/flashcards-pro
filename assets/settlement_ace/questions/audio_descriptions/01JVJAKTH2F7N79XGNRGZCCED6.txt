The period following the Norman Conquest in 1066, stretching to around 1485, is indeed known as the Middle Ages, and it was a time punctuated by frequent warfare. Think of William the Conqueror establishing Norman rule, which involved suppressing rebellions and consolidating power. Then consider the constant border skirmishes with Wales and Scotland. England was also heavily involved in the Hundred Years' War with France, a series of conflicts lasting, as the name suggests, over a century, from 1337 to 1453. Domestically, the Wars of the Roses, a bloody civil war between the Houses of Lancaster and York, raged from 1455 to 1487. So, while there were periods of relative peace, the Middle Ages were characterized by near-constant conflict, making "true" the correct answer. It's easy to think of peaceful medieval villages, but the reality was much more turbulent.
