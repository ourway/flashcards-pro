William Shakespeare, often called England's national poet, lived from 1564 to 1616 and is considered one of the greatest writers in the English language. He wrote around 39 plays, including tragedies like *Hamlet* and *Romeo and Juliet*, histories like *Richard III*, and comedies. *A Midsummer Night's Dream* falls into the comedy category. It's a play full of fairies, love potions, and mistaken identities, set in a magical forest. It's one of his most popular and frequently performed works. The other options are plays, but they were written by different playwrights. *A Doll's House* was written by Henrik Ibsen, a Norwegian playwright, in 1879. *Pygmalion*, which was later adapted into the musical *My Fair Lady*, was written by George Bernard Shaw, an Irish playwright. *Medea* is an ancient Greek tragedy by Euripides. So, while all are famous plays, only *A Midsummer Night's Dream* is attributed to Shakespeare.
