School governors are like the board of directors for a company, but instead of a business, they oversee a school. Their role is strategic, focusing on the bigger picture rather than day-to-day operations. Think of them as the school's compass and map-makers. They help set the school's long-term goals and direction, ensuring it's heading towards success. They also keep a close eye on how well the school is performing, looking at things like exam results, attendance, and the overall quality of teaching. This monitoring helps them make informed decisions about how to improve the school. So, while they're interested in student well-being, they don't directly manage student behavior or hand out awards. Those tasks fall to the teachers and school staff. The governors are there to make sure the school is run effectively and provides the best possible education for all its students.
