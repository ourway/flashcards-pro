Hogmanay is a uniquely Scottish celebration deeply rooted in the country's history and culture. Its origins are debated, with some linking it to Norse and Gaelic winter solstice traditions. Over centuries, it evolved into a distinct New Year's Eve festival, often celebrated with more enthusiasm than Christmas itself, particularly during periods when the Presbyterian Church discouraged Christmas festivities. Hogmanay is known for its lively street parties, traditional music, first-footing customs (being the first person to cross the threshold of a friend or neighbour after midnight, often bringing symbolic gifts), and fire festivals like the Stonehaven fireballs. So, when you think of Hogmanay, remember it's not just any New Year's Eve; it's specifically the Scottish New Year's Eve, steeped in unique customs and historical significance. That's why the answer is that it refers to New Year's Eve in Scotland.
