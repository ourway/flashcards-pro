The idea of a constitutional monarchy, where the monarch's power is limited by laws and a constitution, didn't appear overnight. It evolved over centuries. While the Magna Carta in 1215 was an early step in limiting royal power, it didn't establish a constitutional monarchy. The English Civil War and the Restoration were important periods of upheaval and change, but the *Glorious Revolution* of 1688 is the key event. This revolution saw King James II deposed and replaced by William and Mary. Crucially, William and Mary accepted the *Bill of Rights* in 1689. This Bill of Rights enshrined key principles like parliamentary supremacy, limiting the monarch's power to suspend laws, raise taxes, or maintain a standing army without Parliament's consent. It also guaranteed certain rights and freedoms to citizens. So, while other events played a role, the Glorious Revolution and the Bill of Rights are recognized as the foundation upon which the UK's constitutional monarchy was built.
