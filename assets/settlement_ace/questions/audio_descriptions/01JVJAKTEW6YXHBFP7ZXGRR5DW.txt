The Education Act of 1944, often called the Butler Act after the politician who championed it, was a landmark piece of legislation that fundamentally reshaped the British education system. Before this act, secondary education was not free for everyone, creating a significant barrier for working-class families. The Act aimed to address this inequality and create a more meritocratic society. A key provision was making secondary education free for all children, regardless of their background. This opened up opportunities for a much wider segment of the population. Also, the Act established a clear structure, dividing education into three stages: primary, secondary, and further education. This provided a more organized and coherent educational pathway for students. So, the correct answer is free secondary education for all and a clear division between primary and secondary education because these were the two major changes introduced by the Education Act of 1944. While the Act did impact primary education, it didn't introduce new public examinations specifically for that level, and primary education was already largely in place.
