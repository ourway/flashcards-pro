The British Broadcasting Corporation, or BBC, is the UK's national broadcaster. It's a public service broadcaster, meaning it's meant to serve the public interest, not make a profit for shareholders. Unlike commercial channels that rely on advertising revenue, the BBC is primarily funded by the television licence fee. This fee is a legal requirement for anyone who watches or records live TV programmes, or uses BBC iPlayer, regardless of the device they use. The money collected from the TV licence goes directly to funding the BBC's vast range of services, including TV channels, radio stations, online content, and educational programmes. So, when you pay your TV licence, you're essentially contributing to the BBC's ability to produce and broadcast content for the nation. While some might think the fee goes towards general infrastructure like electricity or other broadcasting services, it's specifically earmarked for the BBC.
