Diwali, a significant festival celebrated by Hindus, Sikhs, and Jains, is known for its vibrant and joyous atmosphere. The festival marks the victory of good over evil, light over darkness, and knowledge over ignorance. A key element of Diwali celebrations involves illuminating homes, streets, and temples with countless lights, both traditional diyas (oil lamps) and modern electric lights. This widespread use of lights is not just decorative; it symbolizes the dispelling of darkness and the welcoming of prosperity and goodness. Because of this prominent feature, Diwali is widely and affectionately referred to as "The Festival of Lights." While other festivals might involve elements of sun, fire, or love, the sheer visual spectacle and symbolic importance of lights during Diwali make "The Festival of Lights" the most fitting and commonly used alternate name.
