Okay, so the House of Commons is where elected Members of Parliament, or MPs, debate and make laws. To keep things orderly and fair, someone needs to be in charge of these debates. That person is called the Speaker. The Speaker's main job is to chair debates in the House of Commons, making sure everyone follows the rules and gets a fair chance to speak. They are elected by MPs at the start of each new Parliament and must remain impartial, meaning they can't favour any particular political party. Think of them as referees in a very important game of politics! The Prime Minister, while the leader of the government, is a participant in the debates, not the chair. The Shadow Minister is a member of the opposition party. A judge has no role in Parliament. The Speaker is the key figure ensuring debates are conducted properly.
