The United Kingdom is often pictured with rolling green hills and quaint villages, but the reality is that most people live in towns and cities. The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the 18th century, led to a massive shift of people from rural areas to urban centers in search of work in factories and industries. This trend continued throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, over 80% of the UK's population lives in urban areas. Think of major cities like London, Birmingham, Manchester, and Glasgow â€“ these are densely populated hubs. While the countryside is a beautiful and important part of British identity and culture, it's simply not where the majority of people reside. So, the statement that most of the UK population lives in the countryside is false.
