The English Civil War, a tumultuous period in British history during the 17th century, was a series of armed conflicts between the Parliamentarians (Roundheads) and the Royalists (Cavaliers) who supported King Charles I. It wasn't just one big battle, but a series of clashes across the country. While battles like Hastings and Waterloo are famous, they occurred at completely different points in British history. The Battle of Hastings was in 1066, marking the Norman conquest, and Waterloo was in 1815, during the Napoleonic Wars. Marston Moor, fought in 1644 near York, was a significant Parliamentarian victory, showcasing the military prowess of Oliver Cromwell. Naseby, in 1645, was another decisive battle where the Parliamentarians crushed the Royalist army, effectively sealing the King's defeat. These two battles, Marston Moor and Naseby, were pivotal turning points within the English Civil War itself, making them the correct choices.
