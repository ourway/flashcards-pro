Between 1680 and 1720, many Protestants fled France to escape religious persecution. These refugees were known as Huguenots. The French King Louis XIV, a Catholic, increasingly repressed Protestantism, culminating in the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. This Edict had previously granted religious freedom to Protestants. With its revocation, Huguenots faced severe persecution, including forced conversion to Catholicism and imprisonment. Consequently, many chose to leave France, seeking refuge in countries like England, Scotland, and Ireland. They brought valuable skills and trades, particularly in weaving and clockmaking, significantly contributing to the British economy and culture. While Quakers were also a religious group in Britain, they originated there and weren't refugees from France. Chartists were a 19th-century political movement advocating for electoral reform, and Sikhs are associated with a religion originating in the Punjab region of India.
