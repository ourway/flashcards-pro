Okay, here's an explanation for the Commonwealth citizen voting rights question:

The Commonwealth is a group of 56 countries, most of which were formerly part of the British Empire. It's evolved into a voluntary association focused on cooperation and shared values. Now, while being a citizen of a Commonwealth country doesn't automatically grant you all the same rights as a British citizen, it does give you some important privileges when residing in the UK. One of these is the right to vote in all public elections, including local elections, general elections to the UK Parliament, and elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Parliament, and Northern Ireland Assembly. This is because Commonwealth citizens residing in the UK are considered to have a close connection to the country, even if they haven't become fully naturalized British citizens. It's a recognition of the historical ties and ongoing relationship between the UK and the Commonwealth nations. So, if you're a Commonwealth citizen living in the UK, you can indeed participate in shaping the country's future through the ballot box. It's worth noting that this right is specifically tied to residency; you need to be living in the UK to exercise it.
