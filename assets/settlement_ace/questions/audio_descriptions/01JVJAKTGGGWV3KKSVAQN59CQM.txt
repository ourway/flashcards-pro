The 19th century witnessed a huge resurgence of interest in the Gothic architectural style, a movement we now call Gothic Revival or Neo-Gothic. Think back to the medieval period, and you'll remember grand cathedrals with pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses â€“ that's Gothic! By the 1800s, architects started incorporating these elements into new buildings. The Houses of Parliament, rebuilt after a fire in 1834, is a prime example. Charles Barry and Augustus Pugin designed it with elaborate Gothic details to evoke a sense of history and tradition. Similarly, St Pancras Station, designed by William Barlow and built in the late 1860s, is renowned for its magnificent Gothic-style train shed and the attached Midland Grand Hotel, a masterpiece of Victorian Gothic architecture. While St Paul's Cathedral is undoubtedly impressive, it's a Baroque building from the late 17th century, predating the Gothic Revival. Buckingham Palace, on the other hand, is primarily Neoclassical in style, reflecting a different architectural trend.
