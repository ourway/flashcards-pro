The Bessemer process revolutionized steel production in the mid-19th century. Before its invention by Henry Bessemer in 1856, steel was expensive to produce and only used for specialized items like cutlery or tools. The key innovation was a way to efficiently remove impurities from molten pig iron by blowing air through it. This process oxidized the impurities, allowing for the mass production of affordable, high-quality steel. This cheaper steel was crucial for building railways, bridges, and ships during the Industrial Revolution. While coal and iron are essential raw materials for steel production, and bronze was a significant metal alloy in earlier historical periods, the Bessemer process specifically refers to the method of refining iron into steel. It didn't directly involve the production of coal, iron ore extraction, or the creation of bronze.
