Okay, so the reason the Welsh Dragon isn't chilling on the Union Flag is all about timing. Back in 1606, when the Union Flag was created, England and Wales were already pretty much a package deal. Think of it like this: England had already absorbed Wales through the Laws in Wales Acts of 1535 and 1542. These acts essentially integrated Wales into the English legal and political system. So, when they were designing the flag to represent the union of England and Scotland, Wales was considered part of the Kingdom of England. The flag combined the flags of England (St. George's Cross) and Scotland (St. Andrew's Cross). Ireland's St. Patrick's Cross was added later in 1801. Because Wales was already legally part of England in 1606, it wasn't seen as a separate entity needing its own representation on the flag. It's a bit of a historical technicality, but that's why the Welsh Dragon is missing out on the flag party!
