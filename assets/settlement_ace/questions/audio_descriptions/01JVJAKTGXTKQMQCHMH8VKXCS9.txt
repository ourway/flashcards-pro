Okay, let's talk about the Tudors and their iconic rose! To understand the symbol, you need to know about the Wars of the Roses, a series of bloody civil wars in the 15th century. On one side was the House of Lancaster, symbolized by a red rose, and on the other was the House of York, represented by a white rose. These families fought for the English throne for decades, creating a lot of instability.

The conflict finally ended when Henry Tudor, who was from the House of Lancaster, defeated Richard III of York at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Henry then became King Henry VII. To unite the country and bring an end to the Wars of the Roses, he married Elizabeth of York. This union was incredibly important, and to symbolize it, the Tudor dynasty adopted a new emblem: a red rose with a white rose inside it. This visually represented the joining of the two houses and the beginning of a new era of peace and stability under the Tudor reign. That's why the correct answer is the red rose with the white rose inside, not just one or the other!
