Okay, so the House of Lords has definitely changed a lot in the last 50 years. Think about it: historically, it was largely made up of hereditary peers â€“ people who inherited their seats. But over time, there's been a real push to make it more representative and less based on birthright. A major turning point was the House of Lords Act 1999, which removed most of the hereditary peers. This dramatically altered the composition of the House. Now, most members are life peers, appointed for their knowledge and experience in various fields. This shift reflects a desire for a more modern and expert-led upper chamber. So, while it still has its critics, the House of Lords is far from static; it's been evolving to better reflect contemporary society and its needs. That's why it's true that its role and membership have evolved.
