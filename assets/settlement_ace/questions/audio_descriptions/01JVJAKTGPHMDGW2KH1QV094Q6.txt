The British civil service is designed to be politically neutral, meaning its members serve the government of the day, regardless of which political party is in power. This neutrality is a cornerstone of the UK's democratic system. Think of it like this: governments come and go, elected by the people, but the civil service provides continuity and expertise. They are responsible for implementing government policies, managing public services, and advising ministers, all while remaining impartial. This ensures that policies are carried out fairly and efficiently, without bias towards any particular political agenda. The idea is that civil servants offer objective advice based on their expertise, and then faithfully execute the decisions made by elected officials. This contrasts sharply with systems where government jobs are largely political appointments, which can lead to instability and a lack of expertise. So, while a new government might bring in new ministers, the civil servants remain in place, providing stability and institutional knowledge.
