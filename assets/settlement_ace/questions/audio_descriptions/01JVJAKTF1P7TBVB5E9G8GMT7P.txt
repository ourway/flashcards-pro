Great Britain is a geographical term referring to the island containing England, Scotland, and Wales. It's important to distinguish this from the United Kingdom, which is a political entity that includes Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Now, while the UK does have territories and overseas possessions around the world, these aren't considered part of Great Britain itself. St Helena is a volcanic tropical island in the South Atlantic Ocean and the Falkland Islands are an archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean on the Patagonian Shelf. Both are British Overseas Territories, meaning they have a historical and political link to the UK, but they are self-governing to a large extent and are geographically distinct. So, while the UK has a responsibility for their defence and international relations, these islands are not physically part of the island of Great Britain. Some people might think they are because of the historical connection, but that's a confusion of political ties with geographical location.
