The UK's court system is structured to handle different levels of legal issues. Think of it like a pyramid, with less serious cases handled at the base and the most serious at the top. Sheriff Courts in Scotland and Crown Courts in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are key parts of this system, and they're designed to deal with significant criminal offences. These aren't for minor things like parking tickets or small disagreements over money. Instead, they handle cases like robbery, assault, and drug trafficking â€“ crimes that have a major impact on individuals and society. The Crown Court, specifically, was established in 1971, replacing the old assize courts, to centralize and streamline the handling of these more serious criminal trials. So, while other courts deal with smaller claims or youth offences, the Sheriff and Crown Courts are where the big, impactful criminal cases are tried.
