Okay, let's talk about women in the British workforce. For a long time, women's participation in the workplace was significantly lower than men's, often due to societal expectations and limited opportunities. However, over the 20th and 21st centuries, things have changed dramatically. The two World Wars, especially, saw women stepping into roles traditionally held by men, proving their capabilities and contributing significantly to the economy. Legislation promoting equal opportunities, like the Equal Pay Act of 1970 and the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975, further paved the way for greater female participation. Today, women make up approximately half of the British workforce. While there's still work to be done to close the gender pay gap and ensure equal representation in leadership positions, the workforce is now much more balanced. So, while a third or a quarter might have been closer to the reality in the past, and "all" is obviously incorrect, "half" reflects the current situation. It's a testament to the progress made in gender equality in the UK.
