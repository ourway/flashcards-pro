The 'Divine Right of Kings' was a political and religious doctrine asserting that a monarch's legitimacy came directly from God. This idea gained prominence in Britain, particularly during the reigns of the Stuart monarchs in the 17th century. Kings like James I and Charles I believed they were answerable only to God, not to Parliament or the people. This meant they had absolute authority to rule as they saw fit. The concept was used to justify their actions and resist challenges to their power. So, when we say the King is appointed by God, that perfectly captures the essence of the Divine Right of Kings. It wasn't about democratic selection or parliamentary approval; it was about a perceived direct mandate from a higher power. While some might think the King was selected by powerful figures like knights, the core idea was always divine appointment, not human selection. This belief ultimately clashed with the growing power of Parliament and contributed to events like the English Civil War.
