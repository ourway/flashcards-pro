The Commonwealth is a fascinating organization with a unique structure rooted in the history of the British Empire. After many colonies gained independence, the Commonwealth was formed as a voluntary association of independent and equal countries. It's important to understand that the Commonwealth isn't a governing body like the European Union, for example. It doesn't have the power to make laws or enforce policies on its member states. Instead, it serves as a forum for cooperation and consultation on various issues like trade, development, and democracy. If a member state seriously violates the Commonwealth's core principles, such as human rights or democratic governance, the organization can suspend that member's participation. Think of it like a club: the club can deny access, but it can't dictate what you do in your own home. So, the Commonwealth can suspend membership, but it doesn't wield any direct power over its members.
