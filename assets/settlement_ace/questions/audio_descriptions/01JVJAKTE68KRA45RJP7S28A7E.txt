The Welsh Assembly, officially known as the Senedd, is the democratically elected body responsible for making laws and holding the Welsh Government to account. Understanding its structure is key to grasping Welsh governance. Unlike the UK Parliament in Westminster, which has hundreds of MPs, the Senedd is a smaller body, designed to specifically address the needs of Wales. The number of members has changed over time, but currently, there are 60 elected members who represent different regions and constituencies across Wales. These Members of the Senedd, or MSs, debate and decide on issues like health, education, environment, and economic development within Wales. So, while the other numbers might seem plausible, remembering that the Senedd is a relatively compact assembly focused solely on Welsh affairs helps you recall that 60 is the correct number of elected members.
