The fight for women's suffrage in the UK was a long and arduous one, spanning decades. It really gained momentum in the mid-19th century, with groups like the National Society for Women's Suffrage campaigning tirelessly. However, it wasn't until after the First World War that significant progress was made. The war effort saw women taking on crucial roles in traditionally male jobs, demonstrating their capabilities and contributing significantly to the nation. This contribution was a major factor in shifting public and political opinion. The Representation of the People Act in 1918 granted the vote to women over the age of 30 who met certain property qualifications. It's important to remember that this wasn't universal suffrage; it was a first step. Full equality, where women could vote at the same age as men (21 at the time), didn't come until 1928. So, while other dates might seem plausible, 1918 is the key year to remember as the initial breakthrough for women's voting rights in the UK.
