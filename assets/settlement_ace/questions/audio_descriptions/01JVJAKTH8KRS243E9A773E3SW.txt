Youth Courts in the UK are a specialized part of the justice system designed to deal with young offenders. The key thing to remember is their age range: they handle cases involving individuals aged 10 to 17. This is because the law recognizes that young people may not have the same level of understanding or responsibility as adults. The aim is to rehabilitate young offenders rather than simply punish them. Now, while someone aged 18, 19, or 20 is still relatively young, they are legally considered adults in the UK. Therefore, their cases would be heard in a regular adult court, not a Youth Court. It might be tempting to think anyone under 21 would go to a Youth Court, but the specific age bracket of 10-17 is crucial to remember for the test. So, the statement is false because Youth Courts have a defined age limit that doesn't extend to everyone under 21.
