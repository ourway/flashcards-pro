Mary, Queen of Scots, had a truly fascinating and turbulent life. Her story is intertwined with both Scottish and English history. She was born in 1542, and incredibly, became Queen of Scotland when she was only six days old! This happened because her father, King James V of Scotland, died shortly after her birth. Because of the political instability in Scotland at the time, and to ensure her safety and a good marriage, she spent much of her childhood in France. She was raised in the French court and even married the French Dauphin, who later became King Francis II. So, the fact that she spent a significant portion of her early years in France is a key part of her biography. It's easy to get her confused with other figures from the Tudor period, but she was not Elizabeth I's sister, that was Mary Tudor, also known as Bloody Mary. And of course, she didn't die of the Black Death, which was long before her time.
