Okay, let's break down why "Sporting events" is the right answer here. Think about each of the items listed: The Grand National is a famous horse race, a real test of endurance for both horse and rider. The FA Cup is a prestigious football (soccer) tournament with a long history, dating back to 1871. The 'Open' refers to the Open Championship in golf, one of the sport's major tournaments. And Wimbledon, of course, is the iconic tennis championship held in London. What do all these have in common? They're all major sporting competitions, attracting huge crowds and media attention. The other options just don't fit. While some of these events might be held near famous places or even parks in London, and you might find shops selling related merchandise, their primary identity is as sporting events. So, remembering these as key events in the UK's sporting calendar will help you nail this kind of question.
