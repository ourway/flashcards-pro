Diwali, often called the Festival of Lights, is a significant celebration observed by several faith communities, most notably Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs. The festival symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. While it's true that Diwali is widely associated with Hinduism, it holds particular importance for Sikhs due to its connection with Bandi Chhor Divas. This day commemorates the release of Guru Hargobind, the sixth Sikh Guru, from imprisonment in 1619. The Guru, along with 52 other princes, was freed from Gwalior Fort, and upon his arrival in Amritsar, the Golden Temple was illuminated with lamps to celebrate. This historical event is why Diwali is a major celebration for Sikhs, marked by prayer, feasts, and the lighting of homes and Gurdwaras. While Taoism, Islam, and Christianity have their own distinct festivals and traditions, Diwali is specifically linked to the historical and religious narratives of the Sikh faith.
