The 'Dunkirk Spirit' refers to the events surrounding the evacuation of Allied soldiers from Dunkirk in France during World War II in May and June 1940. After a rapid German advance, hundreds of thousands of British, French, and other Allied troops were trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk, facing imminent capture or death. The Royal Navy initiated a large-scale rescue operation, but it was the call for civilian vessels to assist that truly defined the 'Dunkirk Spirit'. Hundreds of privately owned boats – fishing boats, pleasure crafts, lifeboats – sailed across the English Channel to help evacuate the stranded soldiers. This remarkable effort resulted in the rescue of over 300,000 men. The 'Dunkirk Spirit' therefore embodies the courage, resilience, and community spirit demonstrated during this desperate situation, specifically the combination of the large-scale rescue and the crucial role played by ordinary citizens in their small boats. While D-Day and the invasion of Berlin were significant events in the war, they don't represent the specific characteristics of civilian involvement and desperate rescue that define the 'Dunkirk Spirit'.
