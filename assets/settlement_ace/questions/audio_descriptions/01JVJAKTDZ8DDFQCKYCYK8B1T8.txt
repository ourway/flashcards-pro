Okay, let's talk about the Iron Age and why it followed the Bronze Age. Think of it as a technological upgrade! The Bronze Age, which lasted for a long time, saw people using bronze – a mix of copper and tin – to make tools and weapons. But bronze has its limitations; it's not as strong or as readily available as iron. Around 800 BC, people in Britain discovered how to extract iron from ore and, more importantly, how to work with it to create much stronger tools and weapons. This was a game-changer! Iron tools allowed for more efficient farming, leading to better food production. Iron weapons gave warriors a significant advantage in battle. So, the Iron Age marked a major step forward in technology and society, making iron the new go-to material after bronze had its day. The Stone Age came long before bronze, and there's no such thing as the Glass Age in this historical context.
