The turn of the millennium, the year 2000, was a huge deal globally, and the UK wanted to mark it with something special. While Big Ben is iconic, it's been around since the mid-19th century, so it wasn't built for the millennium. The Tower of London is even older, dating back to the Norman Conquest! The Eden Project, a fantastic eco-attraction in Cornwall, did open around that time, but it wasn't specifically *for* the millennium celebration. The London Eye, on the other hand, was conceived and constructed specifically to celebrate the year 2000. It's a giant Ferris wheel offering amazing views of London, and it quickly became a symbol of the new millennium and a major tourist attraction. Its official opening was delayed slightly, but its purpose was always to mark this significant moment in time. So, while the other options are significant landmarks, the London Eye is the only one directly linked to the millennium celebrations.
