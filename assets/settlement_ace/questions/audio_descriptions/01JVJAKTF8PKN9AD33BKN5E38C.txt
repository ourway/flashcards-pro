Okay, let's break down how the UK government is structured. Think of the government as having two main parts working together: the political leaders and the people who actually run things day-to-day. The Cabinet is a group of senior politicians, usually the leaders of the main government departments, like the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Home Secretary. They're chosen by the Prime Minister and make the big decisions about what the government does. Now, the Civil Service is different. These are the people who work for the government, but they aren't politicians. They're experts in their fields, and they help the government carry out its policies and provide services to the public. They're supposed to be politically neutral, meaning they serve whichever party is in power. So, the Cabinet sets the direction, and the Civil Service helps make it happen. That's why both the Cabinet and the Civil Service are essential parts of the UK government. Organizations like the National Trust are independent charities, and FIFA is the international governing body of football, so they don't have a role in running the UK government.
