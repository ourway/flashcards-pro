Forced marriage is indeed a criminal offense in the UK, and it's crucial to understand why. The UK places a high value on individual liberty and the right to choose one's own partner. Historically, arranged marriages were more common, but the key difference is consent. In an arranged marriage, both individuals freely agree to the union. Forced marriage, on the other hand, involves coercion, threats, or even violence to make someone enter a marriage against their will. This violates fundamental human rights. The Forced Marriage Unit, a joint initiative between the Home Office and the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, provides support to victims and works to prevent forced marriages. Legislation like the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 made forced marriage a specific crime in England and Wales. So, while marriage traditions vary, the UK law is clear: no one can be compelled into marriage. Thinking it might be false could stem from confusing forced marriage with arranged marriage, but the lack of consent is what makes it a crime.
