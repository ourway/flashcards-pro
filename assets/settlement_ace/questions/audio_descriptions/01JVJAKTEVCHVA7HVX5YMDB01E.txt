Okay, let's break down the Scottish court system to understand where the gravest criminal cases end up. Scotland's legal system is distinct from England and Wales, so it's important to remember that. Think of it as a hierarchy. At the bottom, you have the Sheriff Courts, which deal with a wide range of civil and criminal cases, but generally less serious ones. The Court of Session is primarily a civil court, handling things like divorce and contract disputes, not major criminal trials. Now, the High Court is Scotland's supreme criminal court. It handles the most serious crimes, like murder, treason, and serious drug offenses. These are cases where the potential penalties are the most severe. So, when you hear "gravest criminal cases," think of the highest court in the land dealing with criminal matters, which is the High Court in Scotland. The Crown Court is part of the English and Welsh system, so it's not relevant here.
