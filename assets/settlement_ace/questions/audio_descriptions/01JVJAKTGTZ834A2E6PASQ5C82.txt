In Northern Ireland's legal system, the structure for handling minor cases is quite specific. Think of it as a way to efficiently manage the day-to-day legal issues that arise. The key here is understanding who presides over these cases. Minor cases, which could range from traffic violations to petty theft, are indeed heard by a District Judge or a Deputy District Judge. These aren't just any individuals; they are legally qualified professionals, meaning they've undergone the necessary legal training and are authorized to make judicial decisions. Crucially, they are also paid for their services, indicating that this is a formal, established part of the judicial system. This ensures impartiality and professionalism in handling these smaller legal matters. So, the statement is true because the system is set up to have qualified, paid judges specifically dedicated to dealing with these minor cases at the district level.
