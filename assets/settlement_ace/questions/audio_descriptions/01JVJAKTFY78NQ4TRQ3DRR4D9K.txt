Hogmanay is the Scots word for New Year's Eve, and the celebrations surrounding the start of the new year. The term itself has obscure origins, possibly derived from Norse or Gaelic words, but the tradition is deeply rooted in Scottish culture. Unlike Christmas, which was historically observed more quietly in Scotland due to Presbyterian influences, Hogmanay has always been a major celebration. It's marked by parties, ceilidhs, the singing of Auld Lang Syne, and the practice of "first-footing," where the first person to cross the threshold of a home after midnight brings good luck. So, when you hear "Hogmanay," think of the big New Year celebrations in Scotland; it's their special word for welcoming the New Year. While Christmas and Easter are significant holidays in the UK, they aren't related to this unique Scottish tradition.
