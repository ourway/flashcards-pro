Magistrates' Courts form the bedrock of the justice system in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, handling the vast majority of criminal cases. Think of them as the entry point for legal proceedings. They deal with what are considered "summary offences," which are less serious crimes like minor theft, traffic violations, or public disorder. Because these offences are less severe, they don't require a jury trial. Instead, a panel of either three lay magistrates (ordinary people from the community) or a single legally qualified District Judge hears the evidence and makes a decision. More serious crimes, those indictable offences like murder or robbery, start in the Magistrates' Court but are then passed up to the Crown Court for trial by jury. So, while the Crown Court handles the high-profile cases, the Magistrates' Court is where most people will encounter the legal system, making it true that they handle the bulk of minor criminal matters.
