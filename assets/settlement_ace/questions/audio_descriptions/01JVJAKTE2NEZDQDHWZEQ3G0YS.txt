Suffolk is the correct answer because it's the location of Sutton Hoo, one of the most significant Anglo-Saxon archaeological discoveries in Britain. In 1939, archaeologists unearthed an undisturbed ship burial dating back to the early 7th century. Inside, they found a wealth of treasures, including gold jewelry, silverware, weapons, and armor, all belonging to a powerful Anglo-Saxon king. While the identity of the king is still debated, many believe it was Raedwald, who ruled the Kingdom of East Anglia. The Sutton Hoo discovery revolutionized our understanding of the Anglo-Saxon period, revealing a sophisticated and wealthy society. The other locations listed, while important in British history, are not associated with such a significant Anglo-Saxon royal burial site. Newcastle's history is more closely tied to Roman and later medieval times, London was a Roman settlement and later a major medieval city, and while Kent was a key Anglo-Saxon kingdom, the Sutton Hoo burial is uniquely located in Suffolk.
