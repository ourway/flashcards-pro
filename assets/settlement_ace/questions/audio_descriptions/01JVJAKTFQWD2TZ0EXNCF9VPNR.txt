Police and Crime Commissioners, or PCCs, were established in 2012 to make policing more accountable to the public. Before their creation, police authorities, made up of local councillors and independent members, held this responsibility. The idea behind PCCs is to give local communities a direct say in how their police force is run. They're directly elected by the public, so they're accountable to the people they serve. One of their key responsibilities is to appoint the Chief Constable, the senior police officer in charge of the local police force. This ensures that the person leading the police is someone the PCC, and therefore the public, has confidence in. The Prime Minister, Speaker, and Monarch have national roles, but local policing decisions are specifically delegated to these locally elected PCCs. So, while the Prime Minister deals with national policy, and the Monarch is the Head of State, the appointment of a local Chief Constable falls squarely within the remit of the Police and Crime Commissioners.
