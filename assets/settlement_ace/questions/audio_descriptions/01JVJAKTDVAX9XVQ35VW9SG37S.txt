The UK mainland's geography dictates its maximum length. Imagine a straight line drawn from the northernmost tip of Scotland, John O'Groats, all the way down to Land's End in Cornwall, the southwesternmost point of England. This north-south distance represents the longest stretch you can travel on the island of Great Britain, which is the largest island of the UK. While the UK includes many islands, the question specifically asks about the *mainland*. The actual driving distance is longer because roads rarely follow a perfectly straight line, but "as the crow flies," this distance is approximately 870 miles. The other options are incorrect because they significantly overestimate this geographical reality. It's a good idea to visualize a map of the UK to get a sense of the scale and relative locations of these key landmarks.
