During the 18th century, a powerful intellectual movement swept across Europe, including Britain, that dramatically reshaped how people thought about the world. This era, known as the Enlightenment, emphasized reason, logic, and individual rights. Thinkers began questioning traditional authority, advocating for things like democracy, scientific inquiry, and religious tolerance. It was a time of great intellectual ferment, with new ideas challenging old assumptions. Now, while "The Bard" refers to William Shakespeare, a literary figure from an earlier period, and the "Glorious Revolution" was a specific political event in the 17th century, and "Hogmanay" is the Scottish New Year's celebration, only "The Enlightenment" directly captures this broad period of intellectual and philosophical change that defined the 18th century. So, when you hear about new ideas in politics, philosophy, and science in the 1700s, remember the "Enlightenment" as the key term.
