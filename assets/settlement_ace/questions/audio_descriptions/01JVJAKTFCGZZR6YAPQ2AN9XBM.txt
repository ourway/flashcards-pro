Okay, so when you buy something and it turns out to be faulty, and you decide to take action about it, that falls under civil law. Civil law is all about resolving disputes between individuals or organizations. Think of it as dealing with disagreements where someone feels they've been wronged and are seeking compensation or a resolution. Unlike criminal law, which deals with offenses against society as a whole, civil law focuses on private matters. In the case of a faulty product, you, the buyer, have a dispute with the seller. You're not accusing them of a crime, but you believe they've broken a contract or violated your consumer rights. Therefore, if you legally complain about that faulty product, you're essentially starting a civil case to resolve that dispute. It's about getting a refund, a replacement, or some other form of compensation for the inconvenience and loss you've suffered.
