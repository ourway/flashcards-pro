Okay, let's clear up any confusion about national parks and where they're located. The UK has several stunning national parks, each with its own unique character. Now, the Lake District, famous for its beautiful lakes, rugged mountains, and literary connections to poets like William Wordsworth, is actually located in England, specifically in the county of Cumbria. It became a national park in 1951. Scotland, on the other hand, has its own impressive national parks, such as the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs. So, the statement that the Lake District is the largest national park in Scotland is incorrect simply because it's not *in* Scotland at all. It's easy to get mixed up with all the different regions and parks, but remembering that the Lake District is an English gem will help you avoid this common mistake.
