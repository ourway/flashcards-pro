Henry VII, the first Tudor king, came to the throne in 1485 after winning the Battle of Bosworth Field, ending the Wars of the Roses. This was a period of great instability, with powerful noble families vying for control. To secure his dynasty and prevent further conflict, Henry VII strategically reduced the power of these nobles. He did this through various means, including limiting their ability to raise private armies and imposing heavy fines for disobedience to the crown. By curbing their influence, Henry VII strengthened the monarchy and established a more centralized government. While Henry VIII is famous for breaking with the Church of Rome, and later monarchs saw their powers restricted, Henry VII's reign was primarily defined by consolidating royal authority at the expense of the nobility. This was crucial for bringing stability after decades of civil war and setting the stage for the Tudor dynasty's success.
