Saint David, or Dewi Sant in Welsh, is deeply intertwined with the identity of Wales. He lived in the 6th century and is celebrated as the only patron saint of Wales. Now, while England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland each have their own patron saints – St. George, St. Andrew, and St. Patrick respectively – St. David is uniquely associated with Wales. He founded a monastic settlement in what is now St Davids, a city in Pembrokeshire, and his teachings emphasized simplicity, asceticism, and a strong connection to nature. St. David's Day is celebrated on March 1st, a day when Welsh people around the world wear daffodils or leeks, national symbols of Wales, and celebrate their culture. So, because St. David's life and legacy are so closely tied to Welsh history and culture, he is considered the patron saint of Wales, and not any of the other UK nations.
