The annual Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge is a quintessential British tradition, steeped in history and rivalry. The two universities, both ancient and prestigious, have been competing in this rowing race on the River Thames since 1829. Think of it as a sporting clash of the titans, representing centuries of academic excellence and sporting prowess. The race isn't just a simple sporting event; it's a symbol of the unique culture and traditions associated with these institutions. While other universities like Manchester and Warwick are excellent in their own right, they simply aren't part of this specific, long-standing rowing tradition. The Boat Race is a direct head-to-head contest between Oxford and Cambridge, making them the only possible correct answer. It's a spectacle that draws huge crowds and media attention every year, solidifying its place in British sporting history.
