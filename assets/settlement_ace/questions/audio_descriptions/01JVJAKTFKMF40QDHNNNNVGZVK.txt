The UK operates on a system of local governance rooted in democratic principles. Think back to the Magna Carta in 1215, which started the long process of limiting the power of the monarch and distributing it to the people. This tradition continues today. Instead of civil servants appointed by the central government, towns, cities, and rural areas are managed by local councils. These councils are made up of councillors who are directly elected by the residents of that specific area. This means that local people have a direct say in who makes decisions about things like local services, schools, and planning. These local elections are held regularly, usually every few years, giving people the opportunity to change their representatives if they're unhappy. So, the idea that civil servants appointed by the government are running the show is incorrect because it bypasses this crucial element of local democracy and accountability.
