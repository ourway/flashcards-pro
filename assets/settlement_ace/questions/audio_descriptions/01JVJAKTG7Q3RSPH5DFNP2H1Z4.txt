The Battle of Britain, fought in 1940 during World War II, was a pivotal moment in British history. After the evacuation of Dunkirk, Britain stood alone against Nazi Germany. Hitler planned to invade, but first, he needed to gain air superiority. This is where the Battle of Britain comes in. It was a sustained aerial campaign fought almost entirely in the skies above Britain. The Luftwaffe, the German air force, relentlessly bombed British cities, airfields, and radar stations. The Royal Air Force, or RAF, bravely defended the country, using iconic aircraft like the Spitfire and Hurricane. Because the battle was fought primarily between airplanes in the air, it is correctly identified as an air battle. While the sea was certainly relevant to the overall war effort, this specific clash was defined by the aerial combat. The RAF's success in the Battle of Britain forced Hitler to postpone his invasion plans, marking a crucial turning point in the war.
