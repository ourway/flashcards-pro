The Education Act of 1944, a landmark piece of legislation, aimed to rebuild and reform the British education system after the disruptions of World War II. Before this act, secondary education was often fee-paying and largely inaccessible to working-class families. A key change introduced by the Act was making secondary education free for all children, regardless of their background. This dramatically expanded opportunities and aimed to create a more meritocratic society. The Act also formally established a clear division between primary and secondary education, setting age ranges and curriculum guidelines for each stage. While primary education was already largely available, the 1944 Act solidified its place within a structured system leading to secondary education. New public examinations were introduced later, and while the Act reformed the system, its core focus was on access and structure, making free secondary education and the primary/secondary division the most accurate answer.
