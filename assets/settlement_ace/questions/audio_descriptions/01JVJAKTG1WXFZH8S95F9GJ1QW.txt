Snowdon, or Yr Wyddfa in Welsh, is indeed a mountain, and not just any mountain, but the highest mountain in Wales! It's a key landmark in Snowdonia National Park, a region renowned for its rugged landscapes and natural beauty. The name "Snowdon" is thought to come from the Old English for "snow hill," which makes sense given its often snow-capped peak, especially during winter. While Wales boasts stunning lakes and historic castles, and England is famous for its gardens, Snowdon is definitively a mountain. People travel from all over to hike its various trails, each offering breathtaking views. So, when you think of Snowdon, picture a majestic peak, a challenge for hikers, and a symbol of Welsh natural heritage â€“ definitely a mountain, not a lake, castle, or garden!
