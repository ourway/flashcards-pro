The People's Dispensary for Sick Animals, or PDSA, is the correct answer because it's dedicated to providing veterinary care for pets of people in need. Think of it as a free or low-cost hospital for animals. The PDSA was founded in 1917 by Maria Dickin, who witnessed the suffering of animals during World War I and wanted to provide them with medical care. It's a vital resource for pet owners who might not otherwise be able to afford treatment for their beloved companions. Now, let's look at why the other options are incorrect. The British Red Cross focuses on humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and health and social care services for people. The NSPCC is the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, so their focus is on child welfare. The National Trust works to preserve historic buildings and natural landscapes in the UK. While they might care for animals on their properties, their primary mission isn't animal welfare in the same way as the PDSA.
