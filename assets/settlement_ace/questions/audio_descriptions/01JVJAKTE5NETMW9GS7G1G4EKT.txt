Okay, let's break down what makes up Great Britain. Geographically, Great Britain is the largest island in the British Isles. Now, politically, it's a bit more specific. It refers to England, Wales, and Scotland. Think of it like this: these three countries share a single island and a long, intertwined history. The term "Great" was used historically to distinguish it from Brittany in France. It's easy to get confused with the United Kingdom, which is a broader political entity. The UK *includes* Great Britain, but *also* includes Northern Ireland. So, if you see Northern Ireland listed, you know it's referring to the United Kingdom, not just Great Britain. A handy way to remember it is 'EWS' - England, Wales, and Scotland - the core of Great Britain.
