The European Economic Community, or EEC, was a really important step towards what we now know as the European Union. It was established in 1957 by six founding countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Think of them as the original members of a club focused on economic cooperation and creating a common market. The key thing to remember is that the UK wasn't one of them at the start. Britain initially stood back, hesitant to join this European project. It wasn't until much later, in 1973, that the UK finally became a member of the EEC. So, if you're asked whether the UK was a founding member in 1957, the answer is definitely false. It's easy to get confused because the UK was a member for a significant period, but it's crucial to remember those original six countries that started it all.
