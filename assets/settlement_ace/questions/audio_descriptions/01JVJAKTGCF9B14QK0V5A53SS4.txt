The 2012 Paralympic Games were intrinsically linked to the 2012 Olympic Games, and both were held in London. Hosting both events in the same city was a huge undertaking, showcasing the UK's commitment to sport and inclusivity. London was chosen as the host city back in 2005, and preparations took years, involving massive infrastructure projects and city-wide transformations. The opening ceremony of the Paralympics was a spectacular event, watched by millions around the world, and the games themselves were a resounding success, boosting participation in disability sports and changing perceptions. So, while Belfast, Cardiff, and Edinburgh are all important cities in the UK, they didn't host the 2012 Paralympic Games. The event was branded "London 2012" making it a key part of London's modern history.
