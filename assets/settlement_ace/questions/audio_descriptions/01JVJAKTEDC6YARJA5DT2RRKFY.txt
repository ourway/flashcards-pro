William Shakespeare, often called England's national poet, is a cornerstone of British literature and culture. He wrote around 39 plays, spanning comedies, tragedies, and histories, between the late 16th and early 17th centuries. His works are studied in schools and universities worldwide, and his stories continue to be adapted and performed. Now, when we think of Shakespearean tragedies, one of the most famous is undoubtedly Hamlet. Written around 1600, Hamlet tells the story of the Prince of Denmark who seeks revenge for his father's murder. It's renowned for its complex characters, philosophical themes, and, of course, the incredibly famous "To be or not to be" soliloquy. The other options listed are not plays written by Shakespeare; they are simply titles that don't exist within his body of work. So, Hamlet is the only play on the list that can be attributed to the Bard.
