The Iron Age in Britain, which began around 800 BC and lasted until the Roman invasion, was a time of significant societal and technological change. The introduction of iron tools revolutionized agriculture, making farming more efficient and allowing for larger populations. This led to a more settled way of life, with people living in villages and relying on agriculture for sustenance. Because of this, farming was a primary occupation. The discovery of iron also led to the development of new crafts and industries, with skilled craft workers producing tools, weapons, and other goods. The period was also characterized by tribal warfare and competition for resources, so being a warrior was another common role. Think about hill forts popping up all over the landscape â€“ these needed defending! While some trade existed, the economy wasn't sophisticated enough to support widespread shopkeeping, and the social structure wasn't based on servitude in the way later periods were. Therefore, farmers, craft workers, and warriors accurately reflect the main occupations of people during the Iron Age.
