Christmas, celebrated on December 25th, marks the birth of Jesus Christ and is a cornerstone of Christian tradition. But the celebrations actually begin the day before, on December 24th, which is known as Christmas Eve. Think of it as the anticipation building before the big day! Historically, many cultures considered the evening to be the start of a new day, rather than the morning. So, Christmas Eve holds a special significance as the beginning of the Christmas celebration. It's a time for families to gather, decorate their trees, attend midnight mass in some traditions, and prepare for the festivities of Christmas Day. While December 25th is Christmas Day itself, and December 26th is Boxing Day, a public holiday, the 24th of December is specifically designated as Christmas Eve, the night before Christmas.
