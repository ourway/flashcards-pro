Think of Europe as a big puzzle, and the UK is one of the pieces on the edge. Now, imagine looking at a map. The European continent stretches out, and the UK sits off its coast. If you picture a compass rose on that map, with North at the top, you'll see the UK isn't in the South at all. It's also not quite directly North, nor is it in the East. Instead, it's nestled up in the upper left-hand corner. That puts it squarely in the North-West. It's an island nation, separated from mainland Europe by the English Channel and the North Sea. This geographical position has historically influenced the UK's relationship with Europe, allowing for both connection and a degree of separation. So, when you think of the UK, remember its location: North-West of Europe.
