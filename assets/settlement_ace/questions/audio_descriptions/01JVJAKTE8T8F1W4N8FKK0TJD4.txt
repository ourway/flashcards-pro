Bonfire Night, also known as Guy Fawkes Night, is celebrated on November 5th because it commemorates the failure of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605. A group of Catholics, including Guy Fawkes, planned to blow up the Houses of Parliament and King James I. Their aim was to restore a Catholic monarch to the throne. However, the plot was discovered on November 5th, and Guy Fawkes was arrested. News of the failed plot spread quickly, and Londoners lit bonfires in celebration of the King's survival. Parliament then declared November 5th a day of thanksgiving. Over time, it evolved into Bonfire Night, with fireworks, bonfires, and the burning of effigies of Guy Fawkes. While November 11th is Remembrance Day, honouring those who died in war, and November 25th is just another day, November 5th is specifically tied to this historical event and the tradition of celebrating its failure with bonfires and fireworks.
