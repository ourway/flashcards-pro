Okay, let's explore why those famous poets are grouped together. Poetry, as a literary form, has been around for centuries, evolving through different styles and movements. Robert Browning, William Blake, and Lord Byron are all considered giants in English literature, and they all primarily expressed themselves through poetry. While each had their own unique style and wrote about different themes – Browning known for his dramatic monologues, Blake for his visionary and symbolic works, and Byron for his romantic and often satirical verse – the common thread is that they were all primarily poets. They weren't novelists, playwrights, or essayists first and foremost; their lasting contributions are their poems. So, even though their poetic styles differed, the statement is true because their primary mode of literary expression was poetry, placing them all within that single genre.
