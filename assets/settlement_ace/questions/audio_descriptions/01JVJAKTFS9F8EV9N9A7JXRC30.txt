The Speaker of the House of Commons is essentially the referee of parliamentary debates, ensuring that discussions run smoothly and that all MPs have a fair chance to speak. Now, you might think someone like the Prime Minister or even the Queen would appoint such an important figure, but that's not how it works. The key principle here is the independence of Parliament. To maintain that independence, the Speaker is chosen by the Members of Parliament themselves. After a general election, or when a Speaker retires, MPs hold a secret ballot to elect one of their own to the role. This ensures that the Speaker is accountable to the House, not to the government or the monarch. While the Prime Minister holds a powerful position, and the monarch remains the Head of State, the election of the Speaker is a democratic process internal to the House of Commons, reinforcing its autonomy. The Archbishop of Canterbury has no role in government.
