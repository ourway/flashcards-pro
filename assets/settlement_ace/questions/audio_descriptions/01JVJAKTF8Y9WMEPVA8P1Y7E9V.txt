Magistrates and Justices of the Peace, or JPs, are deeply rooted in the concept of local justice. Their role evolved over centuries, starting in medieval England where local landowners were appointed to keep the peace. Think of them as your neighbors who've taken on the responsibility of upholding the law within your community. They don't need formal legal training, but they do receive extensive training to handle cases fairly. Unlike judges in higher courts, they aren't professional lawyers. They volunteer their time and are selected to represent a cross-section of the local population. This is why they belong to the local community. They live there, understand the local issues, and are accountable to the people around them. While they work closely with the police and the legal system, they aren't part of the police force or the Law Society. And definitely not the ruling party, as their role is to be impartial and independent of political influence.
