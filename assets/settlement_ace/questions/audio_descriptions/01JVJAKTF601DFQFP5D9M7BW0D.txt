Okay, let's talk about the Head of State in the UK. The Head of State is a really important role, and it's currently held by Queen Elizabeth II. Now, you might be thinking about Prince Charles, and it's true he's next in line to the throne, as he's the heir apparent. But he isn't the Head of State *yet*. The Head of State is the reigning monarch, and that's been Queen Elizabeth II since 1952, when she acceded to the throne after her father, King George VI, passed away. She's the longest-reigning British monarch in history! While Prince Philip was a very important figure as the Queen's consort, he never held the position of Head of State. And David Cameron, while a former Prime Minister, headed the government, not the monarchy. So, remember, the Queen is the Head of State, and she has been for a very long time.
