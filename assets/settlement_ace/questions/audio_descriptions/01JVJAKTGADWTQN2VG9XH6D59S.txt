London has been the capital of England since the 12th century and subsequently became the capital of the United Kingdom when England and Scotland united in 1707. Its historical significance is immense, serving as the center of political power, trade, and culture for centuries. Think about the Houses of Parliament, where laws are made, or Buckingham Palace, the official residence of the monarch. London's influence extends far beyond the UK; it's a global hub for finance, fashion, and the arts. While Westminster is a borough within London and contains important sites like Parliament, it's not the capital city itself. Birmingham is a major city, but it's located in the West Midlands and has never been the capital. Windsor, famous for Windsor Castle, is a town west of London, significant as a royal residence but not the seat of government. So, London's long-standing role as the center of government and royal power makes it the undisputed capital of the UK.
