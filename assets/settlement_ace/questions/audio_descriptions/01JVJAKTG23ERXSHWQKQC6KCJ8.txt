The Great Depression, a truly global economic crisis, hit the UK hard in the 1930s. Think of the word "depression" itself â€“ it signals a downturn, a period of hardship. The UK, heavily reliant on international trade, saw its industries crumble as global markets collapsed after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Industries like shipbuilding, coal mining, and textiles, which were the backbone of the British economy, suffered massive losses. This led to widespread unemployment, with some areas, particularly in the north of England, Wales, and Scotland, experiencing unemployment rates exceeding 70%. People struggled to find work, families faced poverty, and there was significant social unrest. So, the idea that the UK experienced high employment during this period is simply incorrect. The Depression was a time of joblessness and economic despair, the opposite of high employment.
