D-Day, which took place on June 6th, 1944, was a pivotal moment in World War II. By 1944, Nazi Germany had occupied much of Europe. The Allies, including Britain, the United States, and Canada, planned a large-scale invasion to liberate these occupied territories. This invasion, known as Operation Overlord, began with the D-Day landings on the beaches of Normandy, France. The "D" in D-Day simply stands for "Day," a common military term for the start date of an operation. While the other options are significant events in history, they aren't related to D-Day. The dropping of the atomic bomb ended the war in the Pacific, the Battle of Trafalgar was a key naval victory in 1805, and VE Day in 1945 marked the end of the war in Europe, nearly a year after D-Day. So, D-Day is specifically remembered as the start of the British and Allied invasion of Europe to liberate it from Nazi occupation.
