Bank holidays are a unique part of the UK's culture, rooted in historical and practical considerations. The term originally referred to days when banks were legally closed, established by the Bank Holidays Act of 1871, introduced by Sir John Lubbock. This act aimed to provide a few fixed days of leisure for the working population. Over time, the concept expanded beyond just banks. While banks still close, the significance is that these days are public holidays, meaning most businesses also shut down, giving people a day off work. It's not just a perk for bankers or related to overtime; it's a nationwide holiday. The name "bank holiday" has stuck, even though its impact is far broader than just the banking sector. So, when you think of a bank holiday, remember it's a day for everyone to relax and enjoy, not just those in finance!
