The Glorious Revolution, a pivotal moment in British history, happened in 1688. To understand why, think about the religious and political tensions brewing at the time. King James II, a Catholic, was on the throne, and many Protestants in England feared he would try to make Catholicism the dominant religion again. This fear was amplified when James had a son, raising the prospect of a Catholic dynasty. To prevent this, leading English figures invited William of Orange, the Protestant ruler of the Netherlands and husband of James's daughter Mary, to take the throne. William landed in England with an army, and James, facing widespread opposition, fled to France. Because there was very little bloodshed, this event became known as the "Glorious Revolution." William and Mary were then crowned joint monarchs, agreeing to rule according to laws made in Parliament, which significantly limited the power of the monarchy and established constitutional monarchy in Britain. So, while other years might seem plausible, 1688 is the specific year this significant shift in power occurred.
