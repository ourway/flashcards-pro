Okay, let's talk about EU driving licenses in the UK. After Brexit, there were initially some questions about how long EU licenses would be valid. The good news is that if you have a driving license issued in an EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland, you can continue to use it in the UK as long as it remains valid. There's no fixed period of validity imposed simply because you're now driving in the UK post-Brexit. The key thing is that your license needs to be up-to-date according to the rules of the country that issued it. So, if your license is valid in, say, Germany, it's valid here. The other options, like 5 years, 2 years, or 12 months, might seem plausible because some regulations have time limits, but they don't apply to the basic validity of an EU driving license. It's a straightforward rule designed to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy for EU citizens living in or visiting the UK.
