The Anglo-Saxon period is a foundational era in British history, marking the transition from Roman Britain to the England we know today. After the Roman Empire withdrew in the early 5th century AD, various Germanic tribes, including the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, began migrating to Britain. These groups gradually established independent kingdoms, each with its own ruler and territory. This process wasn't instantaneous; it took time for these kingdoms to form and consolidate their power. By AD 600, several key Anglo-Saxon kingdoms like Northumbria, Mercia, Kent, and Wessex were already well-established. They had their own distinct cultures, laws, and were actively shaping the landscape of what would become England. So, while the Anglo-Saxon influence was certainly growing by AD 700, the core kingdoms were actually established a century earlier, making the statement that they were established by AD 700 false.
