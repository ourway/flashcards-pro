To become a Member of Parliament, you don't actually *have* to be affiliated with any political party. The UK operates on a system where individuals can stand as independent candidates. Think of someone deeply passionate about their local community, perhaps campaigning on a single issue like improving local parks or opposing a new development. They could gather the required nominations and stand for election without joining a larger political organization. However, it's much more common, and generally easier, to be associated with a party. Parties offer resources, funding, and a ready-made support network of volunteers. They also have established platforms and name recognition, which can significantly boost a candidate's chances. So, while technically anyone who meets the eligibility criteria can stand, regardless of party affiliation, the reality is that most MPs are members of a political party. It's a matter of practicality and strategic advantage, not a legal requirement.
