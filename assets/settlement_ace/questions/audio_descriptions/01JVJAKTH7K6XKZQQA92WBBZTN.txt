In British politics, understanding coalition governments is key. After a general election, if no single party wins an outright majority of seats in the House of Commons, parties sometimes join together to form a coalition. This happened in 2010. The Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, won the most seats but not enough to govern alone. The Liberal Democrats, led by Nick Clegg, held the balance of power. After negotiations, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats agreed to form a coalition government. This was a significant moment, as it was the first coalition government in the UK since World War II. The Labour Party, at that time led by Gordon Brown and then Ed Miliband, was the main opposition party and did not participate in the coalition. So, the statement that Labour and the Liberal Democrats formed a coalition in 2010 is incorrect because it was actually the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
