The UK has a long history of welcoming people from different countries and cultures, and this has significantly shaped its identity. Think about the waves of immigration throughout history, from the Romans and Vikings to more recent arrivals from the Commonwealth and the European Union. This constant influx of new people has enriched British society in countless ways, bringing new skills, ideas, and perspectives. The government's immigration policies, while subject to change, generally aim to attract individuals who can contribute to the economy and society. This includes skilled workers, entrepreneurs, and those seeking to study in the UK. So, the statement is true because the UK, in principle and often in practice, does welcome those who intend to make a positive contribution. While some might think the UK is unwelcoming due to stricter immigration rules in recent years, the underlying principle of attracting contributors remains a key part of the nation's approach.
