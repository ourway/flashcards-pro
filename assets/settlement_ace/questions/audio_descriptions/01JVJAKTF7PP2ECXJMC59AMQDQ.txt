George Frideric Handel, a German-born composer who later became a British citizen, was a master of the Baroque period. He's renowned for his operas, concertos, and especially his oratorios. An oratorio is a large-scale musical work for orchestra and voices, typically telling a religious story. Now, Handel composed many oratorios, but one stands out for its enduring popularity and association with Easter: Messiah. Messiah is a truly iconic work, telling the story of Jesus Christ's life, death, and resurrection through scripture set to music. It premiered in Dublin in 1742 and quickly became a staple of the Easter season. While Handel wrote other notable works like "Water Music" and "Music for the Royal Fireworks", it's "Messiah" that is most closely linked with Easter celebrations due to its subject matter and tradition of performance during that time. The other options, while potentially sounding like classical pieces, are not works by Handel, nor are they typically associated with Easter.
