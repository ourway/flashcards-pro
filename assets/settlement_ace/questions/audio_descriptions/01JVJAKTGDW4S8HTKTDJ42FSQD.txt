Okay, so the House of Commons is where elected Members of Parliament, or MPs, debate and make laws. To keep everything orderly and fair, someone needs to be in charge. That person is called the Speaker. Think of the Speaker as the referee in a game or the conductor of an orchestra. Their main job is to make sure everyone follows the rules of debate, gets a chance to speak, and that the discussions stay focused. The Speaker is an MP, but they must remain impartial and not show favouritism to any political party. They are elected by other MPs at the start of each new Parliament. The other options just don't fit this role. Bishops and Archbishops have roles in the House of Lords and religious affairs, while the Prime Minister leads the government, not the debates themselves. The Speaker is the key figure ensuring fair and structured debates in the House of Commons.
