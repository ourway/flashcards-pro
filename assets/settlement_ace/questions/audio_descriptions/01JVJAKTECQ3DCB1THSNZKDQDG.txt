Around 10,000 years ago, at the end of the last Ice Age, the world experienced significant warming. This caused the massive ice sheets covering much of northern Europe and Britain to melt. All that melting ice led to a dramatic rise in sea levels. Now, Britain wasn't always an island; it was once connected to mainland Europe by a land bridge. As the sea levels rose, this land bridge, which connected Britain to what we now know as France, was gradually submerged. Eventually, the rising waters completely cut off Britain from the continent, creating the English Channel and the island nation we know today. So, while the other options might sound plausible, it was approximately 10,000 years ago that this geographical separation definitively occurred, shaping Britain's unique island identity and influencing its history and development.
