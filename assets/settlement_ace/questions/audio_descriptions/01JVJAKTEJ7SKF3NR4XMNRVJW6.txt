The annual sporting event between Oxford and Cambridge Universities is all about rowing. This tradition, known as The Boat Race, is a classic example of British sporting heritage. It's been held almost every year since 1829, with Oxford and Cambridge University Boat Clubs competing in a side-by-side race along the River Thames in West London. The race is a big deal, attracting huge crowds along the riverbanks and a large television audience. While horse racing, rugby, and sailing are all popular sports in the UK, they don't have this specific, long-standing head-to-head rivalry between these two universities. The Boat Race is unique in that sense, deeply embedded in the history and culture of Oxford and Cambridge. It's a test of strength, endurance, and teamwork, making it a quintessential British sporting event.
