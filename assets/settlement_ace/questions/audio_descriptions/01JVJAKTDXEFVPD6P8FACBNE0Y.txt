England is the largest and most populous of the four countries that make up the United Kingdom, which also includes Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Because of its size and economic history, England has always been the dominant part of the UK. Historically, England was the first to industrialize, leading to significant population growth and urbanization. London, as the capital city of both England and the UK, has always been a major draw for people seeking work and opportunity. Think about it this way: England's land area is more significant than Wales and Northern Ireland combined, and its population density is much higher. So, while Scotland covers a larger land area, much of it is sparsely populated highlands. Therefore, it makes sense that England accounts for the vast majority – approximately 84% – of the UK's total population. The other countries contribute the remaining 16%.
