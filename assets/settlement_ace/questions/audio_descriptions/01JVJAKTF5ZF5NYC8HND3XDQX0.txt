Okay, let's dive into the tumultuous reign of Charles I. He ruled in the 17th century, a time of great tension between the monarchy and Parliament. Charles believed in the Divine Right of Kings, the idea that he was appointed by God and shouldn't be questioned. Parliament, however, was increasingly asserting its power, especially over finances. Things came to a head in 1642 when Charles, in a dramatic and ultimately disastrous move, marched into the House of Commons with armed guards to arrest five Members of Parliament who he considered traitors. He accused them of treason for challenging his authority. This attempt failed miserably â€“ the MPs had already fled. But the event was a major turning point. It was seen as a blatant violation of parliamentary privilege and effectively ignited the English Civil War. So, while the other monarchs listed were significant figures in English history, it was Charles I's actions in the House of Commons that directly led to armed conflict, making him the correct answer.
