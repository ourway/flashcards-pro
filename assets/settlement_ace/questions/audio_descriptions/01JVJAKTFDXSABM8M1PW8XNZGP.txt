Okay, let's talk about the Act of Union in 1707 and what it meant for Scotland. Before this, England and Scotland were separate countries, each with its own parliament, although they shared the same monarch after 1603. However, there were increasing pressures and incentives to unite them formally. England wanted to secure the Protestant succession and prevent Scotland from choosing a different monarch. Scotland, facing economic difficulties, saw potential benefits in accessing English markets and trade. The Act of Union, therefore, was a treaty that formally merged the two kingdoms into one: Great Britain. This meant that the Scottish Parliament was dissolved, and Scottish representatives were sent to the new Parliament of Great Britain in London. So, the key consequence for Scotland was that it *ceased* to be an independent country. It became part of a new, larger political entity. It's easy to get confused and think the Act somehow *created* independence, but it was precisely the opposite. It marked the end of Scotland's independent political existence as it had been known for centuries.
