Anne of Cleves, one of Henry VIII's six wives, hailed from what is now modern-day Germany. To be precise, she was from the Duchy of Cleves, a territory within the Holy Roman Empire. This is significant because during Henry VIII's reign in the 16th century, England was navigating complex political alliances. Henry sought a strategic marriage to bolster his position against potential Catholic enemies like France and Spain. Cleves, being a Protestant territory, seemed like a good match at the time. While Henry was famously disappointed with Anne's appearance upon their first meeting, leading to a quick annulment, her German origin is the key historical fact. The other options – French, Scottish, and Spanish – represent other major European powers of the time, some of whom were considered rivals or potential allies, but none were Anne of Cleves's actual nationality.
