Okay, let's talk about Edward I and Wales. Before 1284, Wales was made up of several independent Welsh principalities. Edward I, the English king, was determined to bring Wales under English control. He launched military campaigns and eventually defeated the last native Prince of Wales, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, in 1282. The Statute of Rhuddlan, enacted in 1284, was a key step in consolidating English rule. It introduced English law and administrative systems to Wales, dividing the country into counties and establishing English-style governance. While it didn't fully integrate Wales into England in the way that happened later, it did formally annex Wales to the Crown of England, placing it under the direct authority of the English monarch. So, the statement is true because the Statute of Rhuddlan was a significant legal act that solidified England's control over Wales and brought it under the English Crown's dominion. It's a common misconception to think Wales was fully integrated at this point, but the Statute was a crucial step in that direction.
