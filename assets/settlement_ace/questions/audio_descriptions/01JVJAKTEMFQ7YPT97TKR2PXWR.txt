The period known as "The Troubles" in Northern Ireland was a deeply divisive and violent conflict that lasted for about thirty years, beginning in the late 1960s. It was primarily a conflict rooted in political, nationalistic, and sectarian identities. On one side were the predominantly Catholic Irish nationalists and republicans who desired a united Ireland, and on the other were the largely Protestant unionists and loyalists who wanted Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. While the conflict involved many complex factors, including discrimination, social inequality, and historical grievances, the violence resulted in a tragic loss of life. Although the scale of the conflict was significant, the number of deaths, while devastating, was not as high as some other conflicts around the world. The correct answer is around 3,000 people died as a result of the Troubles. While 12,000, 30,000 or 60,000 might seem plausible if you are unfamiliar with the details, these figures are overestimations of the actual loss of life.
