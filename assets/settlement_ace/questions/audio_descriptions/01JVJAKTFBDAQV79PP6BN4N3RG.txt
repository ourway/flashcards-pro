The term "Puritan" often causes confusion because it sounds like it might relate to purity within Catholicism, but that's not the case. Puritans were actually a group of English Protestants who emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries. They felt that the Church of England hadn't fully reformed from its Catholic roots after the English Reformation. Instead of complex doctrines, Puritans sought to "purify" the church by simplifying religious practices and focusing on a more personal relationship with God. They emphasized Bible study, preaching, and a strict moral code. Many Puritans eventually emigrated to North America seeking religious freedom, profoundly influencing the culture and values of early colonial America. So, the idea of Puritans being Catholics is incorrect because they were Protestants who wanted a simpler, less ritualistic form of worship, directly opposing complex Catholic doctrines.
