Diwali, often called the "Festival of Lights," is a significant celebration with deep roots in the Indian subcontinent. It symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. Now, while Diwali is widely associated with Hinduism, it's also a very important festival for Sikhs. For Hindus, Diwali often commemorates the return of deities Rama and Sita to Ayodhya after their 14-year exile. Sikhs, on the other hand, celebrate Diwali as Bandi Chhor Divas, marking the release of Guru Hargobind, the sixth Sikh Guru, from imprisonment in the 17th century. He was released from Gwalior Fort along with 52 other princes whom heâ€™d convinced the Emperor to free. The Golden Temple in Amritsar is beautifully illuminated during this time. So, both Hindus and Sikhs have distinct, yet equally important, reasons to celebrate Diwali, making them the correct religious groups for this festival. While other religions might have festivals involving light, Diwali specifically belongs to the traditions of Hinduism and Sikhism.
