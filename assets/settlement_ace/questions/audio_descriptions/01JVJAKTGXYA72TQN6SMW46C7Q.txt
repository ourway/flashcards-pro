Big Ben is actually the nickname for the Great Bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster, also known as the Houses of Parliament. The Palace of Westminster is where the two Houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom – the House of Lords and the House of Commons – meet and make decisions for the country. The clock tower itself is officially called the Elizabeth Tower, renamed in 2012 to mark Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee. So, while you might hear Big Ben referring to the tower, it's technically the bell inside. The sound of Big Ben chiming is instantly recognizable and often broadcast during important national events. It's a symbol of British democracy and is intrinsically linked to the workings of the UK government. That's why it's located at the Houses of Parliament, not at Buckingham Palace, which is the Queen's residence; the Albert Hall, a concert venue; or King's Cross train station.
