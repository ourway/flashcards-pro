The Prime Minister's role in the UK political system is incredibly powerful, extending far beyond just leading the government. Think of it like this: the Prime Minister is essentially the CEO of the country. One of the key responsibilities that comes with that role is the power to make significant public appointments. This includes choosing individuals for important positions like government ministers who head up different departments, senior civil servants who manage the day-to-day running of those departments, and even judges. This power is crucial because the Prime Minister needs to ensure that people in key positions are aligned with the government's agenda and are capable of effectively implementing its policies. While there are checks and balances in place, such as parliamentary scrutiny, the Prime Minister's influence over these appointments is substantial, making the statement that they have power over many significant public appointments absolutely true. It's not an absolute dictatorship, but the PM's influence is undeniable.
