The Union Flag, often called the Union Jack, is a combination of three different flags representing England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The flag of England features the red cross of St. George. Scotland's flag displays the white saltire, which is the cross of St. Andrew. And Northern Ireland is represented by the red saltire, the cross of St. Patrick. So, when you look at the Union Flag, you're actually seeing three crosses layered on top of each other. It's important to remember that Wales isn't directly represented in the Union Flag because when the first version of the Union Flag was created in 1606, Wales was already part of the Kingdom of England. So, the correct answer is three crosses, one for each of the patron saints representing England, Scotland, and Ireland.
