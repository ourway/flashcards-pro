Whitehall is the heart of the British government in London, home to many government departments and historically significant buildings. It's a place where major national events often take place, making it a fitting location for a national war memorial. The Cenotaph, meaning "empty tomb" in Greek, was originally a temporary structure erected in 1919 to mark the end of World War I. It proved so popular that a permanent stone version, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, was built and unveiled in 1920. Every year, the National Service of Remembrance is held at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday, the Sunday closest to November 11th, marking the anniversary of the end of World War I. The Queen, members of the Royal Family, politicians, and military leaders all attend to lay wreaths and pay their respects to those who have died in conflict. So, because Whitehall is the center of government and the location of the annual Remembrance Service, it's the correct location for the Cenotaph. The other options, New Delhi, Derbyshire, and Dorset, simply don't have the same historical or governmental significance in relation to British war remembrance.
