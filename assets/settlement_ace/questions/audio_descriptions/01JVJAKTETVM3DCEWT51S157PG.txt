The Bayeux Tapestry is a fascinating piece of history, and it's easy to see why people might think it's in the UK, given its depiction of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. The tapestry vividly illustrates the events leading up to the Battle of Hastings, the battle itself, and its aftermath, with key figures like William the Conqueror and King Harold. However, despite its focus on English history, the tapestry has resided in Bayeux, Normandy, France, for almost all of its existence. It was likely commissioned by Bishop Odo, William the Conqueror's half-brother, to decorate the Bayeux Cathedral. So, while the tapestry tells a crucial story about England, it's a French treasure, carefully preserved and displayed in a museum in Bayeux. Thinking it might be in England is understandable because of the subject matter, but its historical home has always been across the English Channel.
