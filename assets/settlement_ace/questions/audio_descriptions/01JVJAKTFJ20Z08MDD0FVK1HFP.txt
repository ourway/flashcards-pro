Stonehenge, located in Wiltshire, is a prehistoric monument that dates back thousands of years, with construction starting around 3000 BC. It's one of the most famous landmarks in the UK, and indeed the world, attracting visitors and archaeologists alike. The monument consists of a ring of standing stones, each weighing several tons, and its purpose remains a mystery, though theories range from astronomical observatory to religious site. Offa's Dyke, on the other hand, is an earthwork built in the 8th century by the Anglo-Saxon King Offa of Mercia, designed as a border between England and Wales. Fountains Abbey is a ruined Cistercian monastery founded in the 12th century in North Yorkshire, showcasing medieval religious life. Hadrian's Wall, built by the Romans in the 2nd century AD, marked the northern boundary of Roman Britain. So, while all are significant historical sites, only Stonehenge fits the description of a prehistoric monument in Wiltshire.
