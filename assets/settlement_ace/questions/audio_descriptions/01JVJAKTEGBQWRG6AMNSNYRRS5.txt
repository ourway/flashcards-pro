The phrase "Carry On" is practically synonymous with a series of British comedy films that were incredibly popular from the late 1950s all the way through to the 1970s, and even had a revival in the 1990s. These films were known for their slapstick humor, innuendo, and recurring cast of actors like Sid James, Kenneth Williams, and Barbara Windsor. They became a cultural phenomenon, representing a particular brand of British seaside humor and cheeky wit. While "Carry On" might be used in other contexts, its strongest association by far is with these films. You might think of music because some of the films had catchy theme tunes, or even novels because they told stories, but the visual medium of film is where the "Carry On" legacy truly lives. The films themselves are the art form most closely linked to the phrase.
