EastEnders and Coronation Street are two of the UK's longest-running and most beloved television soap operas. Soap operas, known for their ongoing storylines and relatable characters, are a significant part of British popular culture. "Coronation Street," often called "Corrie," first aired in 1960 and is set in the fictional town of Weatherfield, near Manchester. It focuses on the everyday lives of working-class people. "EastEnders," which began in 1985, is set in the fictional East London borough of Walford and similarly portrays the lives and dramas of its residents. Both shows are broadcast multiple times a week and have millions of viewers, often becoming national talking points. They reflect and sometimes influence British social attitudes and trends. While the UK has many historical landmarks, these names are specifically associated with these iconic TV dramas, making "popular television programmes" the only correct answer.
