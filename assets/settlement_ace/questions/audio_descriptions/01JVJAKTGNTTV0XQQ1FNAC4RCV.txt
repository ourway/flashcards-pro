The Industrial Revolution, spanning the 18th and 19th centuries, was a period of massive technological advancement, but it also had a dark side, especially for children. Factories and mines needed cheap labor, and children, some as young as five or six, were seen as ideal workers. They could fit into small spaces, like under machinery, and were paid significantly less than adults. Sadly, they were not treated well at all. Child labor was rampant, with kids working long hours in dangerous conditions. They faced physical abuse, exposure to hazardous materials, and a lack of education. While it's tempting to think children were protected, the sad reality is that laws to protect them were slow to develop. It wasn't until later in the 19th century that reforms began to address these issues, but for a significant period, children were indeed working in factories and were definitely not treated the same way as adults in terms of safety or rights.
