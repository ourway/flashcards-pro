Pressure and lobby groups are all about influence in the UK political system. Think of them as specialized advocates. They exist because, in a complex society, different groups – businesses, charities, environmental organizations, and many others – have specific interests and concerns. It's impossible for every individual to directly engage with the government on every issue, so these groups act as intermediaries. They research policy, present arguments, and meet with politicians and civil servants to try and shape government decisions. Now, while they might provide information to MPs, their primary goal isn't assisting with constituency work. And while some groups might organize protests, that's just one tactic among many, and certainly not the defining function of all pressure groups. The key thing is that they are focused on influencing government policy and often represent the collective voice of British businesses or other specific sectors.
