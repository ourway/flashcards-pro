Cardiff's story as the capital of Wales is a fascinating one. While Wales has a rich and ancient history dating back millennia, Cardiff wasn't always the obvious choice for its capital. For centuries, Wales was a collection of principalities, not a unified nation with a single capital. It wasn't until 1955 that Cardiff was officially recognised as the capital city. This recognition came about due to Cardiff's size, its economic importance as a major port for exporting coal during the Industrial Revolution, and its already established role as a centre for Welsh administration. The city had grown rapidly in the 19th century, becoming a hub of industry and culture. So, while other Welsh towns have historical significance, Cardiff's modern importance and official designation make it the correct answer. The other options listed are countries, not cities, and also not part of Wales.
