Remembrance Day, observed annually on November 11th, marks the anniversary of the armistice that ended World War I in 1918. The tradition of a two-minute silence began the following year, in 1919, as a way to honour those who had died during the conflict. The idea originated with an Australian journalist, Edward Honey, and was quickly adopted by King George V. The silence is observed at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, symbolizing the exact time the guns fell silent on the Western Front. During this time, people across the UK pause to remember the sacrifices made by members of the armed forces in all conflicts, not just World War I. It's a moment of national unity and reflection, often marked by ceremonies at war memorials and the wearing of poppies. So, the statement that a two-minute silence is observed on Remembrance Day is indeed true, and it's a deeply ingrained part of British culture and remembrance.
