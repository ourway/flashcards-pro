The First World War, a truly global conflict, dramatically reshaped the 20th century. Tensions had been building in Europe for years, fueled by nationalism, imperialism, and complex alliances. The spark that ignited the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in Sarajevo in June 1914. This event triggered a chain reaction, drawing major European powers into war based on pre-existing treaties and obligations. Germany declared war on Russia on August 1, and then on France on August 3. Britain declared war on Germany on August 4 after Germany violated Belgium's neutrality. So, 1914 marks the beginning of this devastating conflict that lasted until 1918. While 1918 is significant as the year the war ended, and 1939 marks the start of the Second World War, the correct answer is 1914, the year that the First World War commenced. A helpful memory aid is to remember the war as '14-18'.
