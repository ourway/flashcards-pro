The Reform Act of 1832 was a pivotal moment in British political history, marking a significant step towards a more representative democracy. Before 1832, the voting system was deeply flawed. Many Members of Parliament represented what were known as "rotten boroughs." These were areas that had once been populated but had dwindled over time, sometimes to the point of having almost no residents, yet they still sent MPs to Parliament. This meant that a tiny number of people could effectively control who was elected. Simultaneously, large industrial cities like Manchester and Birmingham had grown rapidly but had no representation at all. The 1832 Reform Act addressed these imbalances in two key ways. First, it abolished these "rotten boroughs," redistributing parliamentary seats to reflect the population more accurately. Second, it broadened the franchise, meaning more people were given the right to vote. While it didn't introduce universal suffrage – women and a large portion of working-class men were still excluded – it did increase the electorate by about 50%, enfranchising a significant portion of the middle class. It's important to remember that the Act didn't directly affect the monarch's power, nor did it give women the vote; those changes came later in British history.
