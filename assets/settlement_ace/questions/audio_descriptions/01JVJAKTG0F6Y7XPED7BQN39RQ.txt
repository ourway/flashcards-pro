Father's Day, as a celebration, has its roots in the early 20th century in the United States, gaining popularity as a counterpart to Mother's Day. While the specific origins are debated, it's generally attributed to Sonora Smart Dodd, who wanted to honor her father, a Civil War veteran and single parent who raised six children. The initial celebrations occurred in June 1910, and the idea gradually spread. Father's Day became a national holiday in the US in 1972. The UK adopted the tradition, celebrating it on the third Sunday of June, mirroring the American custom. It's a day dedicated to acknowledging the contributions of fathers and father figures in our lives, often marked by giving gifts, cards, or spending quality time together. This focus on paternal appreciation is what makes Father's Day the correct answer, as opposed to Halloween, which is celebrated in October with costumes and trick-or-treating, Boxing Day, a post-Christmas holiday with charitable roots, or Remembrance Day, which honors those who have died in war.
