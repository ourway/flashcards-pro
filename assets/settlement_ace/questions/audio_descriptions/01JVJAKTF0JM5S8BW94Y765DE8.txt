Okay, so the opening of Parliament each year is a really symbolic event steeped in history. Think back to the clashes between the monarchy and Parliament over the centuries â€“ it wasn't always a smooth relationship! The monarch used to have absolute power, but gradually, Parliament gained more and more influence. Now, the State Opening is a carefully choreographed ceremony that reflects this balance. The monarch delivers a speech, written by the government, outlining the government's plans for the coming year. It's read from the throne in the House of Lords. The reason it's the monarch and not, say, the Prime Minister or the Archbishop of Canterbury, is because the monarch is still the Head of State. The ceremony is a formal way of summoning Parliament and setting out the government's agenda. While the Prime Minister leads the government, and the Archbishop is the head of the Church of England, neither holds the constitutional position to formally open Parliament. The Speaker of the House presides over debates, but doesn't have the authority to inaugurate the session. The monarch's role here is a symbolic link to the past and a formal endorsement of the democratic process.
