In British politics, the term "coalition" refers to a government formed when no single political party wins an outright majority of seats in the House of Commons after a general election. This means no party has enough Members of Parliament to pass laws on their own. In 2010, the general election resulted in what's called a "hung parliament," where no party achieved a majority. The Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, won the most seats but not enough to govern alone. After negotiations, they formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, led by Nick Clegg. This was a significant event because coalition governments are relatively rare in British history, especially at the national level. The last time a coalition government was formed was during the Second World War. So, because neither the Conservatives, Labour, nor the Liberal Democrats had a majority, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats had to join together, forming a coalition to govern the country.
