Christmas in the UK is steeped in tradition, and the Christmas dinner is a central part of that celebration. The tradition of eating roast turkey on Christmas Day became popular in England during the Victorian era. Before that, other meats like goose, boar's head, or even peacock were common choices for a festive meal. Turkey became more affordable and widely available, solidifying its place on the Christmas table. Following the main course, Christmas pudding, a rich, dark, steamed pudding made with dried fruits, spices, and often alcohol, is a staple. It's usually prepared weeks in advance and matured, then reheated and served with brandy butter or cream. The pudding itself has roots in medieval England as a type of plum porridge. So, the combination of roast turkey and Christmas pudding is indeed a long-standing and cherished tradition for many families in the UK, making the statement true.
