The idea that women universally stop working after having children is simply not true in modern Britain. While historically, societal expectations often pushed women to prioritize childcare over careers, times have changed significantly. The Equal Pay Act of 1970 and the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975 were pivotal in challenging gender inequality in the workplace. These laws, along with evolving social attitudes, have paved the way for women to pursue both motherhood and professional fulfillment. Today, many women return to work after maternity leave, balancing their careers with family life. Government policies like shared parental leave also support this. While some women may choose to be stay-at-home mothers, it's a personal decision, not a universal rule. So, the statement is false because it doesn't reflect the diverse realities and choices of women in the UK today.
