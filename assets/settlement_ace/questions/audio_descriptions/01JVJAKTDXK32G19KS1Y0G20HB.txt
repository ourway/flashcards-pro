Nightclubs, by their very nature, cater to a different crowd than pubs. Pubs in the UK traditionally operate under licensing hours that often see them closing around 11 PM or midnight. This stems from historical regulations aimed at controlling alcohol consumption and maintaining public order. Nightclubs, on the other hand, are all about late-night entertainment. They usually don't even get going until pubs start to wind down, with peak hours often between midnight and 3 AM. This is because people often go to pubs for a pre-club drink before heading to a nightclub. Nightclubs are designed for dancing and music, activities that typically happen later in the evening when people are looking for a more energetic and social experience. So, while you might pop into a pub for a quick pint after work, you'd head to a nightclub much later to dance the night away.
