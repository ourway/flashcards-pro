Remembrance Day, observed on November 11th, is a day of profound significance in the UK, dedicated to commemorating the sacrifices of those who have served in the armed forces, particularly since World War One. The date itself is deeply symbolic. It marks the anniversary of the armistice signed between the Allies and Germany at Compiègne, France, for the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front of World War I, which took effect at eleven o'clock in the morning—the "eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month" of 1918. This moment effectively ended the war. While November 5th might be tempting due to Guy Fawkes Night, and November 25th is just another day, November 11th is specifically chosen to honour the end of World War I and, by extension, all those who have served and sacrificed in subsequent conflicts. The poppy, a common sight around Remembrance Day, further symbolizes this sacrifice, originating from the poppies that grew on the battlefields of Flanders.
