Agatha Christie, the queen of crime, wrote 'The Mousetrap,' and it's famous for its incredible run in London's West End. The play opened in 1952 and has been running continuously ever since, making it the longest-running play of any kind in the world! It's a classic whodunit, full of twists and turns, and part of its charm is that audiences are traditionally asked not to reveal the ending after seeing it, helping to keep the mystery alive for future viewers. The play's enduring popularity speaks to the British love of a good murder mystery and the enduring appeal of Agatha Christie's work. While the name might conjure images of pest control, in this context, it's all about theatrical suspense and a record-breaking run on the stage.
