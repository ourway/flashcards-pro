The Puritans emerged in England during the 16th and 17th centuries, a time of significant religious upheaval following the Protestant Reformation. This Reformation, sparked by figures like Martin Luther, challenged the authority of the Catholic Church and led to the rise of various Protestant denominations. The Church of England, established by King Henry VIII, became the dominant religious institution, but some felt it hadn't gone far enough in breaking away from Catholic traditions. The Puritans were among these people; they believed the Church of England still retained too many Catholic practices and sought to "purify" it. They advocated for simpler forms of worship, a greater emphasis on personal piety, and a stricter interpretation of the Bible. So, when we talk about the Puritans, it's essential to remember they were a specific group *within* the broader Protestant movement, not affiliated with other religions like Judaism, Catholicism, or Buddhism, which have entirely different origins and beliefs.
