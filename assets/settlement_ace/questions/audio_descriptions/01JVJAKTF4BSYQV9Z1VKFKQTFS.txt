The United Nations, or UN, is a massive international organization founded in 1945 after World War II to prevent future global conflicts. Think of it as a global club where countries come together to discuss issues, solve problems, and promote peace and security. The key thing to remember is that it aims to represent almost every country in the world. Currently, there are 193 member states, which is closest to 190. It's easy to get this confused with other organizations like the European Union, which has far fewer members. The UN's near-universal membership is what gives it its authority and influence on the world stage. So, while the EU might have around 27 members, the UN is a much larger and more inclusive body.
