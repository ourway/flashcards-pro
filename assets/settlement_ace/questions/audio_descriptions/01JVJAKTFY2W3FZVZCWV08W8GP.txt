The jury system is a cornerstone of the UK legal system, dating back centuries. Its primary purpose is to ensure a fair trial by having ordinary citizens, your peers, decide on the facts of a case. Think of it like this: the judge is there to make sure the law is followed, and the lawyers present their arguments and evidence, but it's the jury who ultimately weighs everything up. Their main task is to listen to all the evidence presented during a trial and then, based on that evidence, decide whether the defendant has been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. So, the jury's decision boils down to a simple but incredibly important verdict: is the person 'guilty' or 'not guilty'? They aren't deciding on the punishment; that's the judge's job if someone is found guilty. The jury's role is solely to determine the facts and apply them to the law as explained by the judge, arriving at that crucial verdict.
