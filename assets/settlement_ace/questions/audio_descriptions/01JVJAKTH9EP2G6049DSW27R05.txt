Okay, let's delve into the political scene of 18th-century Britain to understand the rise of the Whigs and Tories. Think of it as the early days of modern political parties. The key thing to remember is that these two groups emerged from earlier factions during the reign of Charles II in the late 17th century. The Whigs, initially, were those who opposed the Catholic James II succeeding to the throne. They generally favoured a stronger Parliament and were supported by merchants and some of the aristocracy. The Tories, on the other hand, supported the hereditary right of the Crown, even if that meant a Catholic monarch. They were largely made up of the landed gentry and the Church of England. Now, fast forward to the 18th century, and these groups had solidified into recognizable political entities, constantly battling for influence. While the Conservatives and Liberals are major parties in British political history, they developed much later, primarily in the 19th century, evolving from these earlier Whig and Tory factions. So, when you think of 18th-century politics, picture the Whigs and Tories as the main players on the stage.
