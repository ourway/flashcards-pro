Okay, so the UK is divided into areas called constituencies, and each one gets to choose someone to represent them in Parliament. Think of it like this: the UK is a big jigsaw puzzle, and each constituency is one of the pieces. To make sure everyone's voice is heard, each constituency holds an election, called a General Election, where the people who live there vote for their favourite candidate. The person who gets the most votes becomes their Member of Parliament, or MP. The MP then goes to Parliament and speaks up for the people in their constituency, raising their concerns and helping to make laws that benefit them. General Elections happen every five years, or sometimes sooner if the government decides to call one. So, it's absolutely true that voters in each constituency elect their MP in a General Election â€“ that's how the UK's representative democracy works. It's a system designed to ensure that every part of the country has a voice in how the UK is run.
