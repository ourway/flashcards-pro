Wales has a rich cultural heritage, and the Welsh language is a significant part of that identity. To protect and promote the language, the Welsh Assembly, now known as the Senedd, operates under a bilingual policy. This means that members are free to use either English or Welsh during debates and proceedings. More importantly, all official publications, documents, and communications produced by the Senedd are available in both languages. This ensures that all citizens, regardless of their language preference, can access information and participate in the democratic process. This commitment to bilingualism reflects the importance of the Welsh language in Welsh society and its ongoing efforts to preserve its linguistic heritage. While some might think it's too costly or impractical to translate everything, the Welsh government views it as essential for inclusivity and cultural preservation.
