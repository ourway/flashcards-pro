Henry VIII's reign in the 16th century was a real turning point in English history, largely because of two major things: his rather eventful love life and his decision to split England from the Catholic Church. Before Henry, the Pope in Rome held significant power over religious matters in England. But Henry wanted to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and the Pope wouldn't grant it. So, in 1534, Henry declared himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England, effectively creating a new church and giving himself the authority to grant his own divorce. This was a huge deal, known as the English Reformation. And yes, he did go on to marry six times! While he was a powerful king in other ways, like strengthening the navy, it's these two things – the break with Rome and the six marriages – that he's most remembered for. It's easy to get confused about which king did what, but thinking about the wives and the church split is a good way to remember Henry VIII.
