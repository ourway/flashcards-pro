Cardiff became the capital of Wales in 1955, although it had been a significant port city for centuries before that. Before 1955, Wales didn't actually have an officially recognised capital. The decision to designate Cardiff as the capital was based on several factors, including its size, economic importance, and its role as a centre for Welsh culture and administration. It's home to important institutions like the Senedd, the Welsh Parliament, and major cultural attractions like the National Museum Cardiff and Cardiff Castle. While Swansea is a large city in Wales with a beautiful coastline, and both Belfast and Edinburgh are capital cities, they are the capitals of Northern Ireland and Scotland respectively. So, Cardiff is the only city on that list that holds the title of the Welsh capital.
