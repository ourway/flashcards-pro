The Enlightenment, an intellectual and philosophical movement that dominated the world of ideas in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries, saw a surge in new ways of thinking about society, government, and economics. Adam Smith, a Scottish economist and philosopher, was a key figure during this period. He's best known for his book "The Wealth of Nations," published in 1776. This book laid the foundations for classical economics, advocating for free markets and limited government intervention. Smith argued that individuals pursuing their own self-interest would unintentionally benefit society as a whole, an idea often referred to as the "invisible hand." His theories about supply and demand, division of labor, and the benefits of free trade are still studied and debated today, making him incredibly influential in modern economics. While David Hume was also a prominent Enlightenment thinker, his focus was more on philosophy and skepticism rather than economics. Isaac Newton, though a giant of the scientific revolution, primarily dealt with physics and mathematics. Robert Smith is not associated with the Enlightenment period or economics.
