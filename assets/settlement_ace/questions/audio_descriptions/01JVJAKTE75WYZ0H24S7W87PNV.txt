Okay, let's break down the Church of England and its other name, the Anglican Church. The Church of England's history is deeply intertwined with the English Reformation in the 16th century. King Henry VIII, you might remember him for having six wives, broke away from the Roman Catholic Church in the 1530s because he wanted to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and the Pope wouldn't grant him an annulment. So, he declared himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England. This act established the Church of England as a separate entity. Now, the term "Anglican Church" is essentially a synonym for the Church of England. "Anglican" comes from "Anglia," the Latin name for England. So, the Anglican Church refers to the churches that are historically linked to the Church of England and share its traditions, theology, and structure. While the Catholic Church is a global institution headed by the Pope, and "The UK Church" or "The English Church" aren't really established terms, "Anglican Church" is the widely recognised alternative name for the Church of England.
