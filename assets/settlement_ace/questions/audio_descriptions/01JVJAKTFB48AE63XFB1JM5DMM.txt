Civil offences, unlike criminal offences, deal with disputes between individuals or organisations. Think of them as violations of someone's rights, leading to compensation rather than punishment by the state. Discrimination in the workplace falls squarely into this category. The Equality Act of 2010 protects individuals from unfair treatment based on characteristics like age, race, religion, or gender. If someone is discriminated against at work – perhaps denied a promotion or unfairly dismissed – they can bring a civil action against their employer to seek redress. This might involve financial compensation or a requirement for the employer to change their practices. Selling tobacco to under 18s, smoking in public places, and carrying a weapon are all criminal offences, meaning they are against the law and punishable by the state through fines or imprisonment. These actions are seen as harmful to society as a whole, not just to a specific individual, which is why they fall under criminal law.
