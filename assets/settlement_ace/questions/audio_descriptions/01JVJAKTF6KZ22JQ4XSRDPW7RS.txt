Donating blood is a really valuable contribution you can make, and it's good to know what to expect timewise. The actual blood donation itself only takes about 5-10 minutes. However, the whole process takes longer because there are important steps before and after the donation. Before you donate, you'll need to fill out a questionnaire about your health and travel history to make sure you're eligible to donate and that your blood is safe for recipients. Then, a healthcare professional will check your iron levels. After the donation, you'll need to rest for a bit and have a snack and a drink to help your body recover. All of this, from arrival to departure, usually takes around an hour. While it might seem like a long time, remember you're potentially saving lives! It's definitely not as short as 10 minutes, and thankfully, it doesn't take as long as 3 or 24 hours.
