To understand the age requirement for becoming a Member of Parliament, it's helpful to think about the rights and responsibilities associated with adulthood in the UK. Historically, the age of majority – when someone is considered an adult in the eyes of the law – was 21. However, this was lowered to 18 in 1969 with the passing of the Family Law Reform Act. This change reflected a broader societal shift towards recognizing younger people's maturity and capabilities. One of the key rights granted at 18 is the right to vote in elections. It makes sense that the age at which you can choose your representatives is also the age at which you can *be* a representative. So, to be eligible to stand for election as an MP and represent a constituency in Parliament, you must be at least 18 years old. While 17-year-olds might be politically engaged, they lack the full legal rights of an adult. And while 21 or 25 might seem like reasonable ages, the law specifically sets the minimum at 18 to align with voting rights and the general understanding of adulthood in the UK.
