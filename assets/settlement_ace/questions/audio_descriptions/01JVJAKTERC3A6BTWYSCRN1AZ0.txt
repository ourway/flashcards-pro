Arranged marriages have a long history in many cultures around the world, and it's important to understand what they actually are. An arranged marriage is when families take a leading role in choosing a partner for their son or daughter. Now, while this practice might seem at odds with the emphasis on individual choice in the UK, the key thing to remember is that forced marriage is illegal. In the UK, the law protects the right of individuals to choose their spouse. So, while arranged marriages are permitted, both individuals must freely and willingly consent to the marriage. If either person is pressured or forced into the marriage, it's considered a forced marriage, which is a serious crime. The law makes no distinction between forced marriage and arranged marriage, and both parties must agree to the marriage for it to be valid. This highlights the UK's commitment to personal freedom and the importance of consent in all aspects of life, especially marriage.
