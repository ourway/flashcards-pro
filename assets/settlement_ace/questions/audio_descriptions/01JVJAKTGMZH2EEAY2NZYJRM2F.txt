Okay, let's delve into the history of the Prime Minister role! While the position of leading the government had existed for some time, the title 'Prime Minister' wasn't officially used for ages. Think back to the early 18th century, specifically the reign of George I. George I spoke primarily German and relied heavily on his ministers to run the country. Sir Robert Walpole, who served as First Lord of the Treasury, became incredibly influential during this time, essentially leading the government. Although he never officially held the title, he was the first person to be commonly referred to as the 'Prime Minister', and historians generally agree he was the first de facto Prime Minister. It's important to remember that the title evolved organically rather than being formally created in one go. Later Prime Ministers like Clement Attlee, Margaret Thatcher, and Winston Churchill came much later, in the 20th century, long after the role was established. So, while those figures are significant Prime Ministers, they weren't the first to be called that.
