The Church of Scotland, often called the Kirk, has a unique structure compared to other Christian denominations. Unlike the Church of England, which has the monarch as its Supreme Governor and is led by archbishops and bishops, the Church of Scotland operates under a Presbyterian system. This means it's governed by a hierarchy of courts, with ministers and elders at the heart of decision-making. Elders are lay members of the church who are elected by the congregation, and they work alongside ministers to oversee the spiritual and practical affairs of the church. This system dates back to the Scottish Reformation in the 16th century, when reformers like John Knox sought to establish a church free from royal or papal control. So, while local authorities might interact with churches on community matters, and the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Pope hold authority in other denominations, the Church of Scotland is specifically governed by its own ministers and elders, reflecting its Presbyterian heritage and commitment to self-governance.
