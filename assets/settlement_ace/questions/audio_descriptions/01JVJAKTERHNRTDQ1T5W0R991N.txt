Okay, here's an explanation of why jurors are selected from the electoral register:

The jury system in the UK is a cornerstone of the justice system, ensuring trials are judged by ordinary citizens. To maintain impartiality and representativeness, jurors are chosen randomly. The electoral register, which lists the names and addresses of everyone registered to vote, serves as the primary source for this random selection. Think of it like a lottery â€“ your name is in the pool if you're registered to vote. This method aims to include a cross-section of society, reflecting different ages, backgrounds, and locations. Using the electoral register helps avoid bias that might arise from other selection methods. For example, using the NHS register would exclude those not registered with a doctor, and alphabetical or postcode selection would clearly skew the representation. So, being on the electoral register is your civic duty, and it also means you could be called upon to participate directly in the legal process as a juror.
