The Chartist movement, active primarily in the 1830s and 1840s, was a significant working-class campaign for political reform in Britain. Their aims were outlined in the People's Charter of 1838, which demanded six key things: universal male suffrage (the right for all men to vote), equal electoral districts, voting by secret ballot, annually elected Parliaments, payment of Members of Parliament, and abolition of property qualifications for MPs. Notice a theme? It's all about expanding the vote for *men*. While the Chartists were radical for their time in advocating for working-class men's rights, the concept of women's suffrage was not a central part of their platform. The fight for women's right to vote really gained momentum later in the 19th and early 20th centuries with the Suffragettes and Suffragists. So, while the Chartists were pushing for democratic reforms, their focus was specifically on male enfranchisement, making the statement that they campaigned for women's right to vote incorrect.
