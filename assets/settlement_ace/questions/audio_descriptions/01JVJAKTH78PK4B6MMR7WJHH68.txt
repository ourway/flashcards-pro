The liberation of Kuwait in 1991, also known as the First Gulf War, was a major international event triggered by Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait in 1990. The United Nations Security Council condemned the invasion and authorized a coalition of forces to liberate Kuwait. Britain played a significant role in this coalition, contributing a substantial military force. This contribution included ground troops, naval vessels, and aircraft. The British forces were involved in key operations, working alongside forces from the United States, Saudi Arabia, and other nations. The aim was to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait and restore Kuwaiti sovereignty. So, Britain's involvement was definitely a key part of the coalition's success.
