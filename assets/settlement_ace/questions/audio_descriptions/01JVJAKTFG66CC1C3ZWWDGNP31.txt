Okay, let's talk about why England was a republic for 11 years. This all stems from the English Civil War in the 17th century, a really turbulent period where Parliament challenged the authority of the monarchy. Eventually, King Charles I was executed in 1649. This was a HUGE deal because it effectively abolished the monarchy. Following the execution, England, along with Ireland and Scotland, became a republic known as the Commonwealth of England. Oliver Cromwell, a key figure in the Parliamentary army, became Lord Protector, essentially the head of state. This republican period lasted until 1660 when the monarchy was restored with Charles II. So, from 1649 to 1660, that's a total of 11 years that England functioned without a king or queen, making 11 years the correct answer. It's easy to get confused with the exact number, but remembering the context of the Civil War and the Restoration helps to solidify the timeline.
