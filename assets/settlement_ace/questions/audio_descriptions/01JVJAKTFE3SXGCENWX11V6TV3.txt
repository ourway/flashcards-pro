Alright, let's talk about the Domesday Book. After William the Conqueror, a Norman, successfully invaded England in 1066, he needed to consolidate his power and understand exactly what he had conquered. Think of it like this: you've just won a board game, and you want to know exactly what properties you now own. That's where the Domesday Book comes in. Commissioned in 1085 and completed in 1086, it was a comprehensive survey of England, detailing who owned what land, how many people lived there, what livestock they had, and the value of everything. It was essentially a massive inventory taken to assess the wealth of the country for taxation purposes. William wanted to know how much he could tax his new subjects! That's why William the Conqueror is the correct answer. The other kings mentioned, like Henry IV and Henry V, came much later and had nothing to do with this initial survey of England. Harold was the Saxon king William defeated, so he definitely wouldn't have ordered it! The Domesday Book is a crucial historical document that gives us an incredible insight into life in England shortly after the Norman Conquest.
