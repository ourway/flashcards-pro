Okay, so after Charles II died in 1685, his brother, James, became king. This is because, at the time, the rules of succession heavily favored direct bloodlines and male heirs. Charles II didn't have any legitimate children, so the crown passed to his closest male relative, which was his brother. You might be tempted to think it could be a nephew, but the direct line always takes precedence. Think of it like a family tree â€“ you go down the trunk before branching out. James II's reign was quite short and turbulent, lasting only three years before he was overthrown in the Glorious Revolution. But for that brief period, he was indeed the monarch, following the established rules of succession at the time. It's a good reminder that understanding the order of succession is key to understanding British history.
