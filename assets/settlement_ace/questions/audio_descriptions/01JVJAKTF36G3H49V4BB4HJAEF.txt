Let's clarify the rules around TV licenses, because they can be a bit confusing! The idea behind the TV license is that it funds the BBC, a public service broadcaster. For many years, people aged 75 and over were indeed entitled to a free TV license. However, this changed in August 2020. Now, free TV licenses are only available to those aged 75 or over who receive Pension Credit. Pension Credit is a benefit for people on low incomes, so the free license is targeted at those who need it most. As for blind people, they are eligible for a 50% discount on their TV license, not 75%. This concession recognizes the importance of television as a source of information and entertainment for those with visual impairments. So, while there used to be a blanket free license for over 75s, and blind people do get a discount, the statement as it's written isn't accurate anymore.
