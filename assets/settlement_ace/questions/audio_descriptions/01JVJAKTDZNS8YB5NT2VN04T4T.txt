The English Civil War, a pivotal period in British history during the 17th century, was a series of armed conflicts between the Parliamentarians (Roundheads) and the Royalists (Cavaliers) over how England should be governed. This war was not a single event, but a series of battles and political maneuvers that ultimately led to the execution of King Charles I and the establishment of a republic, albeit a short-lived one. The Battle of Marston Moor, fought in 1644, was a significant Parliamentarian victory, showcasing the military prowess of Oliver Cromwell. Then, the Battle of Naseby in 1645 proved to be a decisive blow against the Royalist forces, effectively ending the first phase of the war. Now, while the Battle of Waterloo was indeed a major battle, it was fought in 1815 against Napoleon's French forces, long after the English Civil War. Similarly, the Battle of Agincourt, famous for Henry V's victory, occurred way back in 1415 during the Hundred Years' War. So, Marston Moor and Naseby are the two battles that fit squarely within the timeline and context of the English Civil War.
