Bank Holidays in the UK are more than just a day off; they're deeply rooted in the country's history and traditions. The term "bank holiday" originated in the 19th century when banker and politician Sir John Lubbock introduced the Bank Holidays Act of 1871. This act initially designated four holidays in England, Wales, and Ireland, and five in Scotland, aiming to regulate banking transactions and provide essential workers with some guaranteed time off. Over time, these holidays evolved into public holidays observed by most businesses and workers. While some bank holidays, like those around Easter and Christmas, have religious origins, others, like the Early May Bank Holiday, are secular. The key is that they are officially recognized days of rest for the general public, not just for banks. So, while the name might suggest it's only about banks, the essence of a Bank Holiday is a public holiday where most people get a day off work. It's not *always* on a Monday, although some are strategically placed to create long weekends, and it's definitely not just a day off for bankers!
