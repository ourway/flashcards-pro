The National Trust is a conservation organization established in 1895 to preserve the UK's natural and historical treasures. Think of it as a guardian of Britain's heritage. They protect a vast range of properties, including historic houses, gardens, coastlines, forests, and archaeological sites. The Trust was founded by Octavia Hill, Sir Robert Hunter, and Hardwicke Rawnsley, who were concerned about the impact of industrialization and urban development on the countryside. They wanted to ensure that everyone could enjoy these spaces forever. So, when you see a beautiful stately home or a stunning stretch of coastline that's open to the public and well-maintained, chances are it's thanks to the National Trust. The other options, while important charities, have different focuses. The Red Cross provides emergency assistance, the NSPCC protects children, and the Eden Project is a specific conservation project in Cornwall, not a national conservation body.
