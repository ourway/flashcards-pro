The House of Lords, while part of the UK Parliament, operates with a degree of autonomy that sets it apart from the House of Commons. Think of it this way: the Commons is directly elected by the public, making its members accountable to their constituents and political parties. This can sometimes create pressure to follow party lines or prioritize short-term gains to stay in favor with voters. The Lords, on the other hand, are appointed or inherit their positions. This means they aren't as directly tied to public opinion or party politics. Because of this, they can often take a more long-term view and scrutinize legislation with a more independent mindset. They can propose amendments and challenge the Commons, acting as a check on its power. While they can't block legislation outright, their ability to revise and delay bills forces the Commons to reconsider its decisions, making the House of Lords relatively independent.
