School governors and boards are like the strategic leaders of a school, similar to a board of directors for a company. Their main job isn't day-to-day operations like checking homework or planning lessons â€“ that's the responsibility of the teachers and school staff. Instead, governors and boards focus on the bigger picture. They're responsible for setting the overall direction and long-term goals of the school. This includes things like deciding on the school's values, setting targets for student achievement, and making sure the school is financially stable. Think of it as charting the course for the school's future. While they might contribute to the school's ethos and culture, their primary legal and functional responsibility is to determine the strategic direction, ensuring the school is always moving forward in the best possible way. Serving food and drink is also a task for other staff.
