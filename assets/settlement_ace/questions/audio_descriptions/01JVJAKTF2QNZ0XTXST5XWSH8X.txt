Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland, a title it has held since the 15th century. Think of it as the heart of Scottish governance, culture, and history. While London is the capital of the United Kingdom, and Belfast and Cardiff are the capitals of Northern Ireland and Wales respectively, Edinburgh specifically represents Scotland. The city is steeped in history, from Edinburgh Castle, a historic fortress that dominates the skyline, to the Royal Mile, a street connecting the castle to Holyrood Palace, the Queen's official residence in Scotland. Edinburgh has also been a centre of learning and innovation, particularly during the Scottish Enlightenment in the 18th century, earning it the nickname "Athens of the North." So, while the other cities are important capitals in their own right, Edinburgh is the one that embodies the unique cultural and historical identity of Scotland.
