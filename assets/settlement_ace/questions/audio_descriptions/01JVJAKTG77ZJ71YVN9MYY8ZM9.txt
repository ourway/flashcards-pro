The Houses of Parliament, a symbol of British democracy, is home to the iconic clock tower. While many people call the entire tower "Big Ben," that's actually the nickname for the largest bell inside. The tower itself was originally simply called the Clock Tower. Now, here's where the confusion often arises: In 2012, to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, the Clock Tower was officially renamed the Elizabeth Tower. So, while it *is* named after a Queen Elizabeth, it's Queen Elizabeth II, the long-reigning monarch who celebrated 60 years on the throne, not Queen Elizabeth I, the Tudor queen from the 16th century. Queen Elizabeth I, famous for defeating the Spanish Armada, certainly left her mark on British history, but the tower's renaming was a much more recent tribute to a different, equally significant queen.
