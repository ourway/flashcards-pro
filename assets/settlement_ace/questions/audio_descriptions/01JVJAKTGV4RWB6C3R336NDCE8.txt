Okay, let's break down the role of governors and school boards in the UK education system. Think of them as the strategic oversight team for a school. Their primary goal isn't day-to-day management, which is the headteacher's job, but rather ensuring the school is performing well and heading in the right direction. So, the three key roles really boil down to big-picture responsibilities. First, they set the strategic direction â€“ that means deciding on the school's long-term goals and how to achieve them. This involves things like setting the school's vision, values, and overall aims. Second, they ensure accountability. This means making sure the school is meeting its targets and that resources are being used effectively. They hold the headteacher and staff accountable for student outcomes and the overall running of the school. Finally, they monitor and evaluate school performance. This involves regularly reviewing data, such as exam results and attendance rates, and identifying areas for improvement. They also look at things like the quality of teaching and learning, and the effectiveness of leadership. The other options are more related to the daily operation of the school, which is not the role of the governors.
