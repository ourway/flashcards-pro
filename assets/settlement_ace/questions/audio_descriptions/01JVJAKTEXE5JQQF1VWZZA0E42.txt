The House of Lords plays a crucial role in the UK's parliamentary system, acting as a revising chamber to the House of Commons. Think of it as a second set of eyes on legislation. Unlike MPs who are elected to represent specific constituencies, members of the House of Lords are appointed or inherit their positions. This difference in composition means the Lords bring a wealth of experience and expertise from various fields to the legislative process. Their primary function isn't to represent specific groups of people directly, but rather to scrutinize proposed laws and government actions. They carefully examine bills passed by the Commons, suggesting amendments and proposing new laws. These suggestions are then sent back to the MPs for further debate and consideration. This process ensures laws are thoroughly vetted and potentially improved before becoming law. The Lords can't block legislation indefinitely, but their scrutiny and suggested changes can significantly influence the final form of a law.
