Okay, here's an explanation of why the leader of the opposition usually becoming Prime Minister after winning a general election is true. In the UK's parliamentary system, the party that wins a general election, meaning they secure a majority of seats in the House of Commons, usually forms the government. The leader of that winning party is then invited by the monarch to become Prime Minister. This is because they are seen as having the mandate of the people to lead the country. Think of it like this: the general election is essentially a nationwide vote of confidence in different parties and their leaders. If the opposition party wins, it signals that the public prefers their policies and leadership over the incumbent government. While there can be exceptions, such as coalition governments or situations where no single party wins a majority, the standard practice is for the opposition leader to take the reins as Prime Minister when their party emerges victorious. It's a cornerstone of how power transfers in a democratic system like the UK's.
