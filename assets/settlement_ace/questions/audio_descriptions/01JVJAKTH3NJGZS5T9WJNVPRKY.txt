Okay, so understanding how the UK government is formed really boils down to how Parliament works. The UK operates under a parliamentary system, specifically a constitutional monarchy. This means that while the Queen is the Head of State, the real power lies within Parliament, which is made up of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. General elections are held, and people vote for a candidate to represent their local area, or constituency, in the House of Commons. Each of these elected people is called a Member of Parliament, or MP. Now, after a general election, the political party that wins the *most* seats, meaning they have the most MPs in the House of Commons, is the one that gets to form the government. It's not about who got the most individual votes across the whole country, although that often correlates, but about who secured the most constituencies. The leader of that party then usually becomes the Prime Minister. Sometimes, no single party wins an outright majority, and they need to form a coalition with another party to govern effectively. So, the key takeaway is that the party with the largest number of MPs in the House of Commons forms the government.
