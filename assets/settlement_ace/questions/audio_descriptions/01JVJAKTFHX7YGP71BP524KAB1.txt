Think of the Yellow Pages and phone books as historical predecessors to the internet. Before everyone had easy access to online directories, these books were essential for finding contact information. Public servants, like Assembly Members, Members of Parliament (MPs), and Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), are elected or appointed to represent the public. To ensure they are accessible and accountable, their contact details were traditionally listed in these public directories. This allowed constituents to easily get in touch with their representatives to voice concerns, ask questions, or seek assistance. While online directories are more common now, the principle remains the same: public servants should be easily contactable by the people they serve. So, listing them in the Yellow Pages and phone books was a key part of that accessibility. It's a simple but important aspect of a functioning democracy.
