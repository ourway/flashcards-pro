The tragic story of the MacDonalds of Glencoe is a dark chapter in Scottish history, rooted in the Jacobite uprisings of the late 17th century. After the 1689 Jacobite rising, led by Bonnie Dundee, failed, King William III offered a pardon to all Highland clans who swore an oath of allegiance by January 1, 1692. Alasdair MacIain, chief of the MacDonalds of Glencoe, was late to take the oath. He travelled to Fort William, only to be told that he had to swear it before a magistrate at Inveraray. Due to bad weather and other delays, he didn't swear the oath until January 6th. Because of political machinations and a desire to make an example of a clan, the authorities seized upon this technicality. A government force, under the command of Captain Robert Campbell, was billeted with the MacDonalds of Glencoe for about two weeks, enjoying their hospitality. On February 13, 1692, these soldiers turned on their hosts and brutally massacred them. The delay in swearing the oath, though only by a few days, provided the excuse for this infamous act of treachery. The other MacDonald clans mentioned – Sleat, Clanranald, and Keppoch – were not directly involved in this specific historical event, although they were also part of the wider Jacobite conflicts.
