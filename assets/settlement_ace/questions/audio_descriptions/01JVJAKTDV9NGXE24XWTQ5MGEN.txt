When a public body, like a government department or local council, oversteps its authority and infringes on someone's legal rights, the justice system steps in to ensure fairness. The courts can't simply imprison members of the public body or shut it down entirely; that would be disproportionate and disrupt essential services. Instead, the judge's role is to provide a remedy that addresses the specific violation. This usually involves ordering the public body to change its practices to comply with the law, preventing future infringements. For example, if a council unfairly denied someone housing benefits, the judge might order them to reassess the application using the correct criteria. In addition to correcting the practice, the judge can also order the public body to pay compensation to the individual whose rights were violated. This compensation aims to address any losses or damages the person suffered as a result of the public body's unlawful actions. Think of it as restoring balance and ensuring accountability within the system.
