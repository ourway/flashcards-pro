The devastation of World War II, which lasted from 1939 to 1945, made countries realize they needed a better way to prevent future global conflicts. The League of Nations, formed after World War I, had failed to prevent the second World War, so a new international organization was envisioned. Representatives from various nations met in 1945 to draft the UN Charter, which officially established the United Nations. The primary goal was, and still is, to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, and promote social progress, better living standards, and human rights. So, the statement is true because the UN was indeed formed after World War II with the express purpose of preventing war and fostering peace and security on a global scale. It's a direct response to the lessons learned from the war's immense suffering.
