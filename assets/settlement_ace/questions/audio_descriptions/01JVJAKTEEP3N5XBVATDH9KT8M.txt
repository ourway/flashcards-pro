The National Trust is all about protecting Britain's heritage. Think of it as a guardian of historical places and buildings. It was founded in 1895 by Octavia Hill, Sir Robert Hunter, and Hardwicke Rawnsley, driven by a concern that beautiful places were being lost to development. The core mission from the start was to preserve these spaces for the nation to enjoy. So, while planting trees or conserving wildlife are important environmental activities, they aren't the *primary* focus of the National Trust. They might manage woodlands or nature reserves as part of a larger estate, but their main job is to look after castles, stately homes, gardens, and coastlines of historical significance. That's why preserving important buildings and places is the correct answer â€“ it's the heart of what the National Trust does.
