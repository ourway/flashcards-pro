To become a permanent resident or citizen in the UK, the government wants to see that you're going to be a positive contributor to society. This means demonstrating that you understand and respect the fundamental values of the UK. One of the most important aspects of this is respecting the rights of others, which includes their freedom of speech and right to hold different opinions. A tolerant and inclusive society is a cornerstone of British values. Equally important is taking responsibility for yourself and your family. The government wants to ensure that new residents aren't going to be a burden on the state and that they are capable of supporting themselves and their dependents. While owning property or marrying a British citizen can be factors in immigration, they aren't, in themselves, sufficient to demonstrate the commitment to British values and self-sufficiency that are core requirements for permanent residency or citizenship. The focus is on your conduct and ability to integrate into society.
