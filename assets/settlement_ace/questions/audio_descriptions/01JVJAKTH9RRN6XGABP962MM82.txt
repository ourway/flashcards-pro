Okay, let's break down why England and Wales are the countries where the Patron Saint's days aren't public holidays. Think about St. George's Day in England on April 23rd, and St. David's Day in Wales on March 1st. While these days are celebrated with pride and cultural events, they aren't officially recognized as public holidays where people get a day off work. Now, compare that to St. Andrew's Day in Scotland on November 30th, which *is* a bank holiday, and St. Patrick's Day in Northern Ireland on March 17th, which is also a public holiday. It's a bit of a historical quirk, really. There have been campaigns to make St. George's Day and St. David's Day public holidays, but so far, they haven't been successful. So, while you might see flags and celebrations, you won't be getting a day off work or school in England or Wales specifically for their patron saint. It's easy to get confused because all four countries have strong traditions around their patron saints, but the official holiday status is what sets England and Wales apart.
