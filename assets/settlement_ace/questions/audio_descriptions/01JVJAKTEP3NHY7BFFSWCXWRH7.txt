Snowdonia National Park, known in Welsh as Eryri, is a protected area located in Wales, not Northern Ireland. Wales, one of the four countries that make up the United Kingdom, has a distinct geography characterized by mountainous terrain. Snowdonia is home to Mount Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales and England, reaching a height of 1,085 meters above sea level. The park was established in 1951 as the third National Park in Britain, following the Peak District and the Lake District. It covers 823 square miles of diverse landscapes, including lakes, forests, and rugged peaks. Northern Ireland, on the other hand, is located on the island of Ireland and has its own unique landscapes, such as the Giant's Causeway and the Mourne Mountains. While Northern Ireland has beautiful scenery, Snowdonia is specifically and definitively located within Wales, making the statement false.
