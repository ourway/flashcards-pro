Workplace discrimination, while absolutely wrong and illegal, falls under the umbrella of civil law, not criminal law. Think of civil law as dealing with disputes between individuals or organizations, where someone is seeking compensation or a remedy for a wrong done to them. Criminal law, on the other hand, involves offenses against the state, like theft or assault, and can result in imprisonment. So, if someone experiences discrimination at work – perhaps they're unfairly passed over for a promotion because of their gender or ethnicity – they can take their employer to a civil court or an employment tribunal. These tribunals were established to provide a quicker, less formal, and more accessible route to justice than traditional courts. The goal isn't to send the employer to jail, but to get compensation for the employee and ensure the discrimination stops. While severe and systemic discrimination might sometimes trigger criminal investigations related to hate crimes or other offenses, the act of discrimination itself in the workplace is primarily a civil matter.
