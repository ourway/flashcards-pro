Okay, let's break down what Great Britain actually means. Think of it geographically. Great Britain is the name of the *island* that's home to three countries: England, Scotland, and Wales. It's the largest island in the British Isles. Now, this is where it gets a bit confusing because people often mix it up with the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom, or UK, is a *political* term. It includes Great Britain *and* Northern Ireland. So, while Northern Ireland is part of the UK, it's not geographically part of the island of Great Britain. The term "British Isles" is a geographical term referring to the UK, the Channel Islands and the Republic of Ireland. So, if the question asks whether Great Britain refers only to England, Wales, and Scotland, the answer is true because that's what makes up the island itself. It's all about remembering the geographical definition in this case.
