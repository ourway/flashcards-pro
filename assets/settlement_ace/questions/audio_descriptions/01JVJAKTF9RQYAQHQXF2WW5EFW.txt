The United Nations emerged from the ashes of World War II, a conflict so devastating that world leaders recognized the urgent need for a global organization dedicated to preventing future wars. The League of Nations, a similar attempt after World War I, had failed to prevent the descent into another global conflict. So, in 1945, the UN was founded with the core mission of maintaining international peace and security. Its charter explicitly outlines the commitment to resolving disputes peacefully, promoting cooperation among nations, and preventing aggression. While the UN does engage in various other activities like humanitarian aid and promoting human rights, its primary and founding goal, the one that underpins all its other work, is to prevent war and foster a more peaceful world. The other options, like creating a free trade market or examining EU decisions, simply fall outside the UN's core mandate and historical purpose.
