Okay, let's talk about the Hurricane! When we think about British aircraft during World War II, the Hurricane and the Spitfire are the two that really stand out. The Hurricane was actually crucial in the Battle of Britain in 1940. While the Spitfire often gets more of the glory, the Hurricane actually shot down more enemy aircraft during that critical battle. It was a workhorse, reliable and adaptable. It was designed a bit earlier than the Spitfire, so it was simpler in some ways, but that also made it easier to produce in large numbers. The other options, the Mig-21 and F-22, are much more modern aircraft. The Mig-21 is a Soviet-era jet fighter, and the F-22 is a modern American stealth fighter. Neither of them existed during World War II. The PAK-22 is a fictional aircraft. So, thinking about the timeframe of World War II, the Hurricane is the only viable option.
