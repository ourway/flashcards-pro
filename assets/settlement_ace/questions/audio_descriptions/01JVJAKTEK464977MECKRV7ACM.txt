Okay, let's break down why selling tobacco to someone under 18 is a criminal offense in the UK. Think about the laws designed to protect young people. The UK has strict regulations around things like alcohol, cigarettes, and other age-restricted products because of the potential harm they can cause to developing bodies and minds. These laws are in place to safeguard the health and well-being of minors. Selling tobacco to someone under 18 directly violates these protective measures. It's not just a minor infraction; it's a criminal act that can lead to prosecution for the seller. While discrimination in the workplace and housing disputes are serious issues, they typically fall under civil law, meaning they're usually resolved through tribunals or courts focusing on compensation or remedies rather than criminal penalties. Similarly, owing money is generally a civil matter dealt with through debt recovery processes, not criminal charges. So, the key here is understanding the UK's commitment to protecting young people, and that's why selling tobacco to under 18s is a criminal offense.
