Okay, let's talk about Henry VIII and the union of England and Wales. Before Henry, Wales had been under English control for centuries, ever since Edward I conquered it in the 13th century. However, it wasn't fully integrated into the English legal and political system. There were still separate laws and customs in Wales. Henry VIII, keen on centralizing power and creating a more unified kingdom, passed a series of laws known as the Laws in Wales Acts, specifically in 1535 and 1542. These acts essentially made Wales part of England legally. They introduced English law and administration to Wales, gave Welsh shires representation in the English Parliament, and made English the official language of law and government. So, while Wales had been under English influence for a long time, it was during Henry VIII's reign that the formal union took place, making the statement true. It's a key moment in understanding the political geography of the UK today.
