William, Duke of Normandy, is much better known by his other title, William the Conqueror, and that's all thanks to one pivotal event: the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Before this, England was ruled by Anglo-Saxon kings. William, claiming he was promised the throne by the previous king, Edward the Confessor, invaded England with his Norman army. The Battle of Hastings was a decisive victory for William, leading to the Norman conquest of England. This conquest had a profound impact on English language, law, culture, and architecture. Think of all those castles built after 1066! So, while he was indeed the Duke of Normandy, it's his conquest of England that cemented his place in history and earned him the title "William the Conqueror." The other options are simply made up; he wasn't associated with lions, France in that way, or Edinburgh.
