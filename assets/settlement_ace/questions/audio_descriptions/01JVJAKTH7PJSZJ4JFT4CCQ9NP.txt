Wallace and Gromit are quintessential British characters, and their films are beloved worldwide. To understand why "animated" is the correct genre, it's helpful to know a bit about how they're made. Nick Park, the creator, uses a technique called stop-motion animation, also known as claymation. This involves physically manipulating clay figures frame by frame, photographing each tiny movement. When these photos are played back in sequence, it creates the illusion of movement. This painstaking process is what gives Wallace and Gromit their unique, slightly jerky, but utterly charming look. While their adventures might contain elements of adventure or even detective work, and there's a certain affection between Wallace and Gromit, the defining characteristic of the films is that they are brought to life through animation. The other genres simply describe elements *within* the stories, but animation is the *method* of storytelling.
