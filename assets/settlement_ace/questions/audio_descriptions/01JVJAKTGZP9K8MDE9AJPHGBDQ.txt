Okay, let's explore the King James Bible. Back in the early 17th century, King James I, who ruled England and Scotland, recognized that existing English translations of the Bible were causing some division. Different groups had their preferred versions, and there was a desire for a more unified and authoritative text. So, in 1604, he authorized a new translation. A large panel of scholars, drawing from the best available Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic texts, worked diligently for several years. The result, published in 1611, was the King James Bible, also known as the Authorized Version. It wasn't the first English Bible, but it was a fresh translation intended to be accurate and accessible. Its impact on the English language and literature has been enormous, shaping the way English was written and spoken for centuries. It became the standard Bible for many English-speaking Protestants and remains influential even today. So, yes, it was indeed a new English translation of the Bible.
