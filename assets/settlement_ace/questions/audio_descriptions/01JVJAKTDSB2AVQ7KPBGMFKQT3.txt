To understand why 18 is the minimum age to become a Member of Parliament, it helps to consider the broader context of civic responsibility in the UK. Eighteen is the age at which you gain full adult rights and responsibilities. This includes the right to vote in all elections, enter into contracts, and, crucially, to stand for public office. Before 2006, the minimum age to become an MP was 21, but the law was changed to align with the voting age and other adult responsibilities. This change reflected a belief that if someone is old enough to vote and make important decisions about the country's future, they are also old enough to represent their constituents in Parliament. While 16 and 17-year-olds have some rights, they are still considered minors under the law, and 21 and 25 are simply arbitrary numbers that don't align with the established age of majority in the UK. So, if you want to make laws, you first need to be considered an adult under those laws!
