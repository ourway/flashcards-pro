Queen Victoria's story is quite remarkable, especially when you consider how young she was when she became Queen. Think about it: she was born in 1819, and her path to the throne wasn't exactly straightforward. Several of her uncles stood ahead of her in the line of succession. But, one by one, they passed away without leaving legitimate heirs. This meant that when her uncle, King William IV, died in 1837, Victoria was next in line. She was only 18 years old at the time. Imagine being a teenager and suddenly finding yourself the head of a vast empire! That's why the answer is 18. The other options are way off; she certainly wasn't a baby or toddler when she became Queen. Her youthfulness at the time made her reign all the more extraordinary. The Victorian era, named after her, went on to be a period of massive social, economic, and technological change.
