The National Trust is a charity that plays a vital role in preserving Britain's heritage. Established in 1895, its mission is to protect historic buildings, gardens, coastlines, and countryside for everyone to enjoy. Think of places like Stonehenge, vast stretches of the Lake District, or even Beatrix Potter's farmhouse â€“ the National Trust likely has a hand in their upkeep! To manage all these properties, the National Trust relies heavily on the generosity of volunteers. It takes a lot of people to maintain these places, welcome visitors, and run educational programs. The sheer scale of the National Trust's operations means they need a huge volunteer workforce. That's why the number of volunteers is approximately 61,000. While smaller numbers might seem plausible at first glance, they simply wouldn't be enough to support the Trust's extensive portfolio of properties and activities across the UK.
