The Wars of the Roses were a series of bloody civil wars fought in England during the 15th century, specifically from 1455 to 1487. They were fought between two powerful families, the House of Lancaster, symbolized by a red rose, and the House of York, symbolized by a white rose, for control of the English throne. Think of it as a medieval Game of Thrones! The conflict involved noble families, shifting alliances, and battles across the country. While the fighting technically continued for a couple of years after, the decisive moment came at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. This is when Richard III, the Yorkist king, was killed, and Henry Tudor, who represented the Lancastrian claim, won the battle and became King Henry VII. This victory marked the end of the main phase of the Wars of the Roses and the beginning of the Tudor dynasty, which would rule England for over a century. So, while the battles rumbled on for a short time, 1485 is the key year because it represents the turning point and the establishment of a new royal house.
