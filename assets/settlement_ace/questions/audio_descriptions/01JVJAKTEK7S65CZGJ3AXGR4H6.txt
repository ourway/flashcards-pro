The Oscars, officially known as the Academy Awards, are prestigious accolades presented annually for artistic and technical merit in the film industry. Winning an Oscar signifies significant recognition within the global film community. Now, thinking about British actors who've recently received this honor, Colin Firth stands out. He won Best Actor for his portrayal of King George VI in "The King's Speech" in 2011, a film that resonated deeply due to its historical context and Firth's compelling performance. Tilda Swinton, known for her versatility and captivating performances in both independent and mainstream films, won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 2008 for her role in "Michael Clayton". While Jayne Torvill is a celebrated British ice skater, famous for her Olympic gold medal, and Robert Louis Stevenson is a renowned Scottish novelist, neither of them are actors nor have they won Oscars. Therefore, Colin Firth and Tilda Swinton are the correct choices when naming two British actors who have recently won Oscars.
