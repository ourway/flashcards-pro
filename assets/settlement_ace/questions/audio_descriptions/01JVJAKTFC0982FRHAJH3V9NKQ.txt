The Crimean War, fought from 1853 to 1856, pitted Britain, France, and the Ottoman Empire against Russia. While we often think of modern warfare as being heavily documented, the Crimean War marks a turning point in media coverage. Before this conflict, news from the battlefield was often delayed, censored, or simply didn't reach the public in a timely manner. The Crimean War saw the emergence of war correspondents like William Howard Russell of The Times, who provided regular, uncensored reports from the front lines. These reports, along with early photography by figures like Roger Fenton, brought the realities of war home to the British public in a way never before experienced. This extensive and immediate media attention is what makes the Crimean War the pioneering conflict in terms of media coverage. While battles like Waterloo and Hastings were historically significant, they predate the development of mass media. The Battle of Britain, although more recent, built upon the media coverage practices established during the Crimean War.
