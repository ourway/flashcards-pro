The late 19th century was a time of rapid industrialization in Britain, which unfortunately led to the destruction of many beautiful landscapes and historic buildings. A growing concern for preserving these national treasures led to the formation of the National Trust in 1895. It wasn't founded by the government or a wealthy benefactor, but rather by the dedicated efforts of three volunteers: Octavia Hill, Sir Robert Hunter, and Hardwicke Rawnsley. Octavia Hill was a social reformer concerned with housing for the poor, Hunter was a solicitor who worked on common land rights, and Rawnsley was a vicar who was passionate about the Lake District. Together, they envisioned an organization that could protect places of historic interest and natural beauty for the benefit of the nation. The other dates, 1745, 1795, and 1845, are all too early, predating the Victorian era's environmental consciousness and the specific social conditions that spurred the National Trust's creation. So, remember 1895 as the year these three volunteers took action to safeguard Britain's heritage.
