Police and Crime Commissioners, or PCCs, were established in England and Wales in 2012 to make the police more accountable to the public. Think of them as the elected voice of the people when it comes to policing. Before PCCs, police authorities existed, but they were often seen as less directly accountable. The key thing to remember is that PCCs have a dual role: they set the strategic direction and priorities for the local police force, and they control the police budget. This means they decide what issues the police should focus on in their area, like tackling anti-social behaviour or reducing burglaries. They then allocate the necessary funds to make those priorities a reality. So, because they decide both the priorities and the budget to support them, the statement is true. It's easy to see why someone might think it's false, perhaps assuming the police themselves set their own priorities, but the PCC is there to ensure the police are responding to the needs of the local community.
