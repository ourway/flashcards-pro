The United Nations is a massive international organization founded in 1945 after World War II to promote peace, security, and cooperation among nations. Think of it as a global club where countries come together to discuss problems and find solutions. The UN's membership has grown significantly since its inception with just 51 original member states. Today, the vast majority of the world's independent nations are part of it. The correct answer is 190 because that's the closest number to the current membership. While the exact number can fluctuate slightly as new countries join or situations change, it's consistently around that figure. The other options are significantly lower than the actual number of member states, reflecting a misunderstanding of the UN's widespread global representation.
