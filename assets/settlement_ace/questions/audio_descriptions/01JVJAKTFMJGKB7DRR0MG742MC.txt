The 5th of November is all about remembering the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, a pivotal moment in British history. Back then, religious tensions were high, with Catholics facing persecution. A group of Catholics, led by Robert Catesby, hatched a plan to assassinate King James I and blow up the Houses of Parliament during the State Opening. Guy Fawkes, a explosives expert, was tasked with guarding the gunpowder hidden beneath the building. However, the plot was foiled when a letter was sent warning a member of Parliament to stay away. Fawkes was discovered, arrested, and the plot was exposed. Ever since, November 5th has been commemorated as Guy Fawkes Night or Bonfire Night. Bonfires are lit, effigies of Guy Fawkes are burned, and fireworks are set off to celebrate the failure of the plot and the survival of the King and Parliament. While the end of WWII, the Queen's birthday, and the defeat of the Spanish Armada are all significant historical events, they are celebrated on different dates.
