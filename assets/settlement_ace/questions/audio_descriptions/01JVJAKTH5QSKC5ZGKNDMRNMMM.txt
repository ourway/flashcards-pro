The Tower of London has served many purposes throughout British history, from a royal palace to a prison. It's particularly infamous for its role in imprisoning and executing high-profile figures. Anne Boleyn, one of Henry VIII's six wives, was imprisoned within its walls in 1536. Henry VIII wanted to remarry and needed to get rid of Anne. He accused her of treason and adultery, charges that are widely believed to have been fabricated. After a swift trial, she was found guilty and sentenced to death. Anne was beheaded on Tower Green, a private execution site within the Tower, on May 19, 1536. While Stonehenge and Maiden Castle are significant historical sites, they have no connection to Anne Boleyn. Windsor Castle, while a royal residence, was not the location of her imprisonment or execution. The Tower of London, therefore, is the correct answer because it was the site of Anne Boleyn's imprisonment, trial, and execution.
