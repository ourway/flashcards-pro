Being a school governor or board member is a really important way to get involved in your local community and support education. Think of schools as being run by a team â€“ the headteacher manages the day-to-day operations, but the governors or board members are like the strategic oversight team. They help set the school's direction, make sure it's well-managed, and hold the headteacher accountable. Anyone who is passionate about education and has the relevant skills can apply to be a governor. You don't need to be a parent at the school, or even have a background in education. What's really valuable is bringing different perspectives and experiences to the table. So, the statement is true because becoming a school governor or board member is absolutely a way to contribute to your local community. It's a chance to make a real difference in the lives of young people and help shape the future of education in your area.
