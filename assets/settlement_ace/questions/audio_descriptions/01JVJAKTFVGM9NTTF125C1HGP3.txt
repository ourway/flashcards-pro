Okay, let's talk about Welsh rebellions. To understand when they ended, we need to remember that Wales wasn't always part of England. For centuries, it was made up of independent kingdoms. English influence grew over time, especially after the Norman Conquest in 1066. However, the Welsh fiercely resisted English rule. One of the most famous rebellions was led by Owain Glyndŵr in the early 15th century. He declared himself Prince of Wales in 1400 and led a significant uprising against English rule. Although Glyndŵr's rebellion initially gained considerable ground, it was eventually suppressed. While there were smaller acts of resistance after Glyndŵr, his defeat marked the end of large-scale Welsh rebellions seeking independence. So, the 15th century is the correct answer because it encompasses the period of Glyndŵr's uprising and its ultimate failure, effectively ending major Welsh attempts to overthrow English rule. The 16th and 17th centuries saw Wales more integrated into the English system, making those incorrect options.
