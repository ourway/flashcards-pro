Okay, let's talk about TV licenses for older folks in the UK. For a long time, everyone over 75 was automatically entitled to a free TV license, which covers watching or recording live TV on any channel, or downloading or watching BBC programmes on iPlayer. This was a government-funded initiative designed to help pensioners, many of whom rely on television for companionship and information. However, things changed a bit in recent years. While it *was* universally true, the BBC, which is responsible for TV licensing, has had to make some adjustments due to funding pressures. Now, while those over 75 are still eligible for a free TV license, it's dependent on whether they, or their partner living at the same address, receive Pension Credit. Pension Credit is a benefit that provides extra money to help with living costs for people over State Pension age and on a low income. So, the statement that individuals over 75 are exempt from paying is generally true if they meet the Pension Credit criteria. It's a good idea to check the latest information on the TV Licensing website to be absolutely sure of the current rules, as policies can evolve.
