Boudicca, the warrior queen of the Iceni tribe in what is now Norfolk, is a powerful symbol of resistance against Roman rule in Britain. The Romans began their conquest of Britain in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius, and initially, some tribes like the Iceni were allowed to rule as allies. However, when Boudicca's husband, Prasutagus, died, the Romans disregarded his will, seized his lands, and treated Boudicca and her daughters brutally. This sparked a fierce rebellion in AD 60 or 61. Boudicca led the Iceni and other tribes in a devastating revolt, destroying Roman settlements like Colchester (Camulodunum), London (Londinium), and Verulamium (St Albans). Although the rebellion was ultimately crushed by the Roman army, Boudicca's defiance has made her a legendary figure in British history, representing courage and resistance against oppression. Columba, on the other hand, was an Irish missionary who spread Christianity in Scotland much later, in the 6th century. Claudius and Hadrian were Roman emperors, not tribal leaders resisting Roman rule.
