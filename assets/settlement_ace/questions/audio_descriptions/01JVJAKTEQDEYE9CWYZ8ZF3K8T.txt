The red dragon, or *Y Ddraig Goch* in Welsh, is a powerful and ancient symbol deeply intertwined with Welsh identity. Its roots stretch back centuries, appearing in Welsh folklore and possibly even Roman military standards. Legend says that Merlin, the famous wizard, prophesied that the red dragon would defeat a white dragon, symbolizing the triumph of the Welsh over their enemies. While the exact origins are debated, the dragon gained prominence during the reign of Welsh rulers like Cadwaladr in the 7th century. Over time, it became a potent emblem of Welsh heritage and resistance. That's why, when Wales needed an official flag, the red dragon was the obvious choice. It represents their history, their spirit, and their unique place within the United Kingdom. Other symbols, while potentially associated with other parts of the UK, simply don't carry the same historical weight and specific connection to Wales.
