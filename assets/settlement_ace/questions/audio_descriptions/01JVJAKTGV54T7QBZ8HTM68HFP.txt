Criminal law deals with offenses that are considered harmful to society as a whole, not just to individuals. Think of it as the government stepping in to protect everyone. Racial crimes, sadly, are a clear example. These aren't just personal disputes; they target individuals based on their race or ethnicity, creating fear and division within the community. Similarly, selling tobacco to someone under 18 is a criminal offense because it's seen as harming a vulnerable person and potentially leading to long-term health problems, which impacts society. The law sets a minimum age to protect young people. On the other hand, disputes about faulty goods or discrimination in the workplace, while serious, are generally handled under civil law. These involve disagreements between individuals or organizations where compensation or resolution is sought, rather than punishment by the state. Civil law aims to resolve private disputes, while criminal law aims to punish and deter actions that threaten public safety and order.
