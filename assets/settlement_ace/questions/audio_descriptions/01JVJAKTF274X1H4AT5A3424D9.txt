The British Broadcasting Corporation, or BBC, is the UK's public service broadcaster. It was established in 1922 and has a unique funding model. Unlike commercial channels that rely on advertising revenue, the BBC is primarily funded by the television license fee. This fee is a legal requirement for anyone who watches or records live TV programmes, or uses BBC iPlayer, regardless of the device they use. The money collected from TV licenses goes directly to the BBC to fund the creation and broadcast of a wide range of content, including news, current affairs, drama, documentaries, children's programmes, and radio. This funding model is designed to ensure the BBC's independence from commercial and political pressures, allowing it to focus on providing high-quality, impartial programming for the benefit of the public. While Sky is a major broadcaster in the UK, it's a commercial entity funded by subscriptions and advertising. The DVLA deals with driving licenses, and road maintenance is funded through general taxation and local council budgets, so neither of those are connected to TV license fees.
