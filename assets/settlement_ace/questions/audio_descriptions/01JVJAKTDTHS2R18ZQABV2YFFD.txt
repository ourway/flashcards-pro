The Cabinet is essentially the Prime Minister's team of senior ministers, and in the UK's parliamentary system, the Prime Minister holds significant power in forming their government. Think of it like this: the Prime Minister is the captain of the ship, and they get to choose their crew. After a general election, the leader of the party who can command the confidence of the House of Commons – usually the party with the majority of seats – becomes the Prime Minister. One of their first and most crucial tasks is to appoint the Cabinet. These are Members of Parliament, usually from the Prime Minister's own party, who will lead key government departments like the Treasury, the Home Office, and the Foreign Office. The Prime Minister chooses individuals they trust and believe are capable of implementing their policies and running the country effectively. While the monarch formally approves the appointments, this is largely a formality based on the Prime Minister's selection. So, the Prime Minister is the one who decides who sits around the Cabinet table.
