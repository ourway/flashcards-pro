The Open Championship, often referred to as simply "The Open" or the "British Open," is one of the four major championships in professional golf. What makes it unique is that it's the only major played outside of the United States. It was founded in 1860 and is administered by The R&A, which stands for the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, one of the oldest and most prestigious golf clubs in the world, located in Scotland. The tournament rotates among a select group of primarily links courses in the United Kingdom, including famous venues like St Andrews, Royal Liverpool, and Royal Birkdale. So, while the other options are definitely British institutions – Wimbledon is a famous tennis tournament, Royal Ascot is a horse race, and the English Premier League is football – they have nothing to do with major golf tournaments. The Open is the only major golf championship that ventures outside US borders, making it the correct answer.
