During the Stone Age, which lasted for thousands of years, the geography of Britain was very different from what it is today. The key thing to remember is that sea levels were much lower. This was largely due to the Ice Age, where vast amounts of water were frozen in glaciers. Because of all that frozen water, the North Sea was actually dry land! This meant that Britain wasn't an island, but was connected to mainland Europe by a wide strip of land, often referred to as a land bridge, linking it to countries like France, Belgium and the Netherlands. This land bridge allowed people and animals to migrate freely between Britain and the continent. As the Ice Age ended and the glaciers melted, sea levels rose, eventually flooding the land bridge and creating the island we know today. So, the answer is land bridge because it was the actual geographical feature that connected Britain to the rest of Europe during that period. A telephone or power line is a modern invention and would not have existed in the Stone Age.
