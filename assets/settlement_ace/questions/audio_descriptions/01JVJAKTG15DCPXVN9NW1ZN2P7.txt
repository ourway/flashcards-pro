Jury service is a really important part of the UK's legal system, and it's based on the idea that ordinary people should be involved in making decisions about justice. To make sure the system works fairly, there are rules about who can and can't be a juror. One of those rules is about age. While you have to be at least 18 to serve on a jury, there's also an upper age limit. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, you can't be a juror if you're 75 or older. In Scotland, the upper age limit is 70. The reason for this age limit is to ensure that jurors are able to fully participate in often lengthy and complex trials. It's not about discriminating against older people, but rather about ensuring the jury is capable of handling the demands of the role. So, the statement that there's an upper age restriction for jury service is indeed true.
