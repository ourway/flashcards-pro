The National Trust plays a vital role in preserving Britain's heritage. Think of it as a guardian of the UK's most treasured places. Founded in 1895, its mission is to protect historic buildings, gardens, coastline, and countryside for future generations to enjoy. The Trust relies on membership fees, donations, and legacies to fund its work, which includes maintaining properties, opening them to the public, and conserving natural habitats. Because it's a non-governmental organization that depends on public support and focuses on preservation rather than profit, it operates as a charity. So, when you see the National Trust logo, remember it represents a charitable organization dedicated to safeguarding the UK's cultural and natural treasures.
