The poppy's association with remembrance stems directly from the First World War. After the devastating battles fought in the fields of Flanders, Belgium, the landscape was utterly destroyed. Yet, amidst the devastation, bright red poppies bloomed in abundance. This striking image was immortalized in the famous poem "In Flanders Fields" by John McCrae, a Canadian physician and soldier. The poppy quickly became a symbol of remembrance, representing the sacrifice of those who died in the war and a promise to never forget them. Wearing a poppy on Remembrance Day, typically observed on November 11th, is a way to honor those who served and continue to serve in the armed forces. The other flowers simply don't have this historical connection to wartime remembrance. While the daffodil is associated with Wales and the lily can symbolize mourning, neither carries the specific and powerful meaning linked to the poppy and the First World War.
