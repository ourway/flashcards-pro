Alright, so you're trying to understand what gives us a peek into life right after the Normans invaded and took over England in 1066. Think of William the Conqueror wanting to know exactly what he'd just conquered! That's where the Domesday Book comes in. It wasn't just any old book; it was a massive survey, ordered by William himself in 1085, to record who owned what, how much land there was, what kind of resources were available â€“ basically, a complete inventory of England. This helped him figure out taxes and solidify his control. It's an incredibly detailed snapshot of the country and its people just a couple of decades after the Norman Conquest, giving us invaluable insights into the social and economic structure of the time. While the Bayeux Tapestry depicts the events leading up to the conquest, it doesn't detail everyday life afterward. The Great Charter, or Magna Carta, came much later, in 1215, and focused on limiting the king's power. And while a prehistoric village is interesting, it doesn't tell us anything about Norman England!
