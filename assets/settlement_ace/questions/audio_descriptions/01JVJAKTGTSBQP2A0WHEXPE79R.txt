The Magna Carta, signed in 1215, is a cornerstone of British legal history and a symbol of liberty. Before the Magna Carta, the king was often seen as being above the law, able to rule as he pleased. The barons, powerful landowners, were unhappy with King John's heavy taxes and abuse of power. They forced him to agree to the Magna Carta, which contained clauses limiting the king's power and protecting certain rights. A key principle established by the Magna Carta was that everyone, including the monarch, was subject to the law. This was a revolutionary idea at the time and laid the foundation for the development of constitutional law in Britain. While the Magna Carta didn't immediately create a perfect system of justice, it set a crucial precedent that the king could not act arbitrarily and was accountable under the law. So, the statement is true because the Magna Carta fundamentally shifted the balance of power and established the principle of the rule of law, even for the king.
