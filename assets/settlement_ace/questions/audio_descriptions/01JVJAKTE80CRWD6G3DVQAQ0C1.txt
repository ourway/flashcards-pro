Okay, let's break down what "Great Britain" actually means. Geographically, it refers to the largest island in the British Isles. Now, politically, it's a little more specific. Think of it like this: the United Kingdom is a political entity, a country, while Great Britain is a geographical one, but with political implications. The United Kingdom, officially the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, is made up of Great Britain *plus* Northern Ireland. So, Great Britain itself includes England, Scotland, and Wales. It's easy to get confused because the terms are often used interchangeably, but remembering that Great Britain is the island itself helps. Northern Ireland, while part of the UK, is on the island of Ireland, not the island of Great Britain. A helpful mnemonic is to think of "Great Britain" as the 'Greater' landmass, excluding Northern Ireland.
