Okay, so the story of Jewish settlement in Britain is quite interesting. Jewish communities existed in England before 1290, but they were expelled by King Edward I. For over 350 years, there was essentially no open Jewish community in England. Then, in the mid-17th century, things began to change. Oliver Cromwell, who led the country after the English Civil War, unofficially permitted Jews to return in 1656. This wasn't a formal law, but rather a pragmatic decision driven by economic considerations and Cromwell's own religious beliefs about tolerance. A key figure was Menasseh ben Israel, a rabbi who petitioned Cromwell to allow Jewish people to resettle. So, 1656 marks this important turning point, the year when Jews began to openly re-establish a community in London after centuries of absence. While there might have been individuals before, 1656 is the accepted date for the formal re-establishment of the community. The other dates are incorrect because they fall outside this specific period of resettlement during Cromwell's rule.
