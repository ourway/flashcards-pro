Wales has a unique linguistic landscape, deeply rooted in its history and cultural identity. The Welsh language, a Brythonic Celtic language, has been spoken in Wales for over 1500 years. While English is widely spoken, Welsh remains a vital part of Welsh culture, particularly in rural areas. To protect and promote the language, the Welsh Language Act of 1993 gave Welsh equal status with English in Wales. This commitment to bilingualism is reflected in the workings of the Senedd, the Welsh Parliament. All Senedd members are encouraged to be bilingual, and all official publications, documents, and proceedings are produced in both English and Welsh. This ensures that all citizens can engage with the government in their preferred language, reinforcing the principle of equality between the two languages within Wales's governance. It's a visible and practical demonstration of Wales's commitment to preserving its linguistic heritage.
