Okay, let's talk about invasions of England! England's history is full of different groups arriving and trying to take over. The Romans were there for centuries, starting in 43 AD, and they really shaped the landscape and culture. Then came the Anglo-Saxons, who gradually established kingdoms after the Romans left in the 5th century. The Vikings were a big problem for the Anglo-Saxons, raiding and settling, especially in the 9th and 10th centuries. But the *last* successful invasion was the Norman Conquest in 1066. William the Conqueror, from Normandy in France, defeated King Harold at the Battle of Hastings. This was a huge turning point because the Normans brought a new language (French), a new legal system, and a new way of organizing society (feudalism). While the Vikings and Anglo-Saxons certainly invaded and settled, the Norman Conquest is the one that stuck as the final successful takeover from abroad. It completely reshaped England, and its effects are still felt today.
