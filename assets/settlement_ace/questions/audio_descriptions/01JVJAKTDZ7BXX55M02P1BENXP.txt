Snowdonia National Park is a protected area known for its stunning mountain scenery, diverse wildlife, and rich cultural heritage, all firmly rooted in Wales. The name "Snowdonia" itself comes from "Snowdon," which is the highest mountain in Wales. The park covers a significant portion of North Wales, showcasing the Welsh landscape and language. Scotland, on the other hand, is known for its own distinct national parks, such as Loch Lomond and the Trossachs, and the Cairngorms. These Scottish parks feature different geographical characteristics and are located much further north. So, while both Wales and Scotland boast beautiful national parks, Snowdonia is definitively Welsh, making the statement that it's in Scotland incorrect. Thinking of the Welsh dragon, a national symbol, guarding its mountainous home in Snowdonia can help you remember its Welsh identity.
