St. David's Day, celebrated on March 1st, is all about celebrating Wales and its patron saint, David. David lived in the 6th century and was a key figure in Welsh Christianity, founding monasteries and performing miracles. He's known for his simple lifestyle and teachings. The date, March 1st, is believed to be the anniversary of his death in 589 AD. So, while St. Patrick's Day on March 17th is a big deal for Ireland, and St. George's Day on April 23rd celebrates England, St. David gets his special day at the start of March. November 30th is St. Andrew's Day, celebrating Scotland. Remembering that David's day kicks off the month of March is the key to getting this question right.
