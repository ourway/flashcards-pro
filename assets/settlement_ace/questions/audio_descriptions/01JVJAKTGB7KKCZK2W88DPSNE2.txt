Henry VIII, known for his six wives and the English Reformation, had a tumultuous marital life. Understanding the fate of his wives requires knowing a bit about Tudor history. Henry sought a male heir to secure the Tudor dynasty, which led to his many marriages. Catherine of Aragon was divorced when she failed to produce a male heir. Anne of Cleves was divorced after a short, unconsummated marriage. Jane Seymour died shortly after giving birth to Henry's only son, Edward. Catherine Parr outlived Henry. However, two of Henry's wives, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, met a tragic end. Anne Boleyn, initially a lady-in-waiting to Catherine of Aragon, captivated Henry, leading to his break with the Catholic Church so he could marry her. When she failed to produce a male heir and faced accusations of treason, she was executed in 1536. Catherine Howard, a much younger bride, also faced accusations of infidelity and was executed in 1542. These executions highlight the ruthless nature of Tudor politics and Henry VIII's determination to secure his reign.
