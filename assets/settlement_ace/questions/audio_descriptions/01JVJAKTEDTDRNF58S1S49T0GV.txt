The UK Parliament is the legislative body responsible for making laws in the United Kingdom, and it's structured in a bicameral system, meaning it has two chambers. Think of it like a two-part system designed to provide checks and balances in the law-making process. The House of Commons is the primary chamber, made up of elected Members of Parliament (MPs) who represent constituencies across the UK. They are directly accountable to the public. The other chamber is the House of Lords. Historically, the Lords consisted of hereditary peers, but now it includes life peers appointed for their distinguished service. The House of Lords scrutinizes bills that have been approved by the Commons, offering amendments and revisions. While they can't block legislation outright, they can delay it and force the Commons to reconsider. So, the two key components working together are the House of Lords and the House of Commons. The other options are incorrect because they don't reflect the actual names or structure of the UK Parliament.
