The Anglo-Saxons, who began arriving in Britain around the 5th century AD, were not Christian when they first invaded. They were pagans, worshipping a variety of gods and goddesses similar to those found in Norse mythology. Think of Thor, Odin, and other figures. Their religious practices involved rituals, sacrifices, and a deep connection to the natural world. Christianity only began to spread among them later, primarily through the work of missionaries like St. Augustine, who arrived in Kent in 597 AD. He was sent by Pope Gregory the Great to convert the Anglo-Saxons. The conversion process was gradual, taking several centuries, and even after adopting Christianity, some pagan traditions persisted for a while. So, while Christianity eventually became dominant, the initial Anglo-Saxon invaders were definitely not Christian; they brought their own distinct pagan beliefs with them.
