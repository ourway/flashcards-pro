Okay, let's explore why the 15th century is the key period for the establishment of English laws and language in Wales. For centuries, Wales maintained its own distinct culture, language, and legal system, even after being conquered by England in the 13th century. However, the Welsh continued to resist English rule, and figures like Owain Glyndwr led significant rebellions seeking independence in the early 15th century. Although Glyndwr's revolt was ultimately unsuccessful, it highlighted the need for England to consolidate its control over Wales. The English Crown achieved this through a series of laws known as the Laws in Wales Acts, passed between 1535 and 1542, during the reign of Henry VIII. These acts formally incorporated Wales into the English legal system, abolished Welsh laws, and made English the official language of law and administration. While the acts were passed in the 16th century, the 15th century set the stage for this integration. Therefore, the 15th century is the correct answer because it represents the period when the groundwork was laid for the eventual imposition of English laws and language, even though the formal acts occurred later. The 13th and 11th centuries are too early, as Welsh laws and customs were still dominant then, and the 17th century is too late, as the integration had already occurred.
