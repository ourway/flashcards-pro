Bonfire Night, celebrated every year on November 5th, has its roots in a failed attempt to overthrow the British government in 1605. A group of Catholics, angered by King James I's Protestant policies, plotted to blow up the Houses of Parliament during the State Opening. Guy Fawkes was a member of this group, and his role was to guard the explosives. He was discovered in the cellars beneath Parliament with barrels of gunpowder, arrested, and later executed. While he wasn't the mastermind behind the plot, Fawkes became the most recognizable figure associated with it. So, when we think of Bonfire Night, we remember Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot. The event is commemorated with bonfires, fireworks, and the burning of effigies, often of Guy Fawkes himself. While Roger Bannister was a famous athlete, Napoleon a French emperor, and Ian Fleming the author of James Bond, none of them have any connection to the Gunpowder Plot or Bonfire Night.
