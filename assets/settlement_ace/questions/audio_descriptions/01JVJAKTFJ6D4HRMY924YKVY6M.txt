The role of mayor in the UK has deep historical roots, stretching back to the medieval period. Originally, mayors were appointed to represent the interests of towns and cities to the monarch and to oversee local governance. Over time, their powers have evolved, but the ceremonial aspect remains significant. While some cities have directly elected mayors with considerable executive power, many local councils appoint a mayor annually from among their elected councillors. This appointed mayor acts as a figurehead for the council and the local community. They preside over council meetings, represent the council at civic events, and promote the area. So, while local business leaders, members of the Royal Family, or local celebrities might be involved in community life, the *title* specifically given to the ceremonial leader appointed by local councils is indeed a mayor. It's a tradition that connects modern local government to centuries of British history.
