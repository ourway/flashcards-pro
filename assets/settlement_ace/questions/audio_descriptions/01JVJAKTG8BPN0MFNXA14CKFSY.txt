Scotland handles legal cases involving young people through a unique system called the Children's Hearings System. This system is designed to prioritize the well-being and needs of the child, rather than focusing solely on punishment. It's quite different from the adult court system. The Children's Hearings System was established to ensure that young people receive the care and protection they need, and that decisions are made in their best interests. The hearings involve a panel of trained volunteers who listen to the child, their family, and other relevant professionals. They then make decisions about the child's care and support. So, while you might think of a "Youth Court" as a logical place for these cases, Scotland has specifically created this alternative system to be more supportive and less adversarial for young people. The Crown Court and Sheriff Court are typically for more serious adult criminal cases, so they wouldn't be involved in cases handled by the Children's Hearings System.
