Okay, let's talk about buying alcohol in the UK. The law is pretty clear on this one. The legal drinking age in the UK is 18. This means you have to be 18 or older to buy alcohol in a pub, restaurant, shop, or anywhere else that sells it. This law is enforced to protect young people and to control alcohol consumption. While someone aged 16 or 17 is allowed to drink beer, cider or wine with a meal in a licensed premises, they can't buy it themselves. It's tempting to think that maybe at 16 you can buy alcohol, perhaps because you can do other things like drive a moped or get married with parental consent. However, the rules around alcohol are stricter. So, remember, if you're under 18, you can't legally purchase alcohol in the UK.
