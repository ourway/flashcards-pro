The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 56 independent and equal countries, most of which were formerly part of the British Empire. It's all about cooperation and friendship. Now, while the British monarch, currently King Charles III, serves as the Head of the Commonwealth, this role is largely symbolic. Heâ€™s a figurehead, a symbol of the association, but he doesn't wield political power over the member states. Each member country is self-governing and makes its own decisions. So, to say the UK's leading politician leads the Commonwealth would be incorrect because the Commonwealth isn't led by any single government or politician. It operates on consensus and shared values, not hierarchical leadership. It's easy to assume the UK Prime Minister might be in charge, given the historical connection, but the Commonwealth has evolved beyond that. The King's role is more about promoting unity and representing the shared history and values of the member nations.
