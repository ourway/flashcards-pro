Okay, let's talk about the discovery of DNA. This is a huge moment in scientific history! The structure of DNA, that double helix we all picture, was cracked in 1953. Now, you might think of Oxford or Edinburgh as old, prestigious universities, and you wouldn't be wrong, but the groundbreaking work on DNA wasn't done there. It all happened at the University of Cambridge. Specifically, James Watson and Francis Crick, working at Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory, pieced together the puzzle using X-ray diffraction data largely collected by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins at King's College London. While Franklin and Wilkins provided crucial data, it was Watson and Crick who built the model that revealed DNA's structure. So, while other universities have their own impressive scientific legacies, Cambridge is the one directly linked to unlocking the secrets of life itself through the discovery of DNA's structure.
