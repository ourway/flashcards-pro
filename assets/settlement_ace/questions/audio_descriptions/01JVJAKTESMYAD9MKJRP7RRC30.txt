The Union Flag, often called the Union Jack, is a powerful symbol representing the United Kingdom's history. It's not just a random design; it's a combination of three different flags, each representing a different patron saint. The flag of England features the red cross of St. George, their patron saint. Scotland's flag displays the white diagonal cross of St. Andrew. And Ireland is represented by the red diagonal cross of St. Patrick. While Wales is part of the UK, the Welsh dragon isn't included in the Union Flag because, historically, when the first version of the flag was created in 1606, Wales was already united with England. So, the Union Flag visually combines these three crosses: St. George's, St. Andrew's, and St. Patrick's, making a total of three crosses represented in its design. It's easy to miscount because the crosses overlap and create a complex pattern, but remembering the three patron saints helps clarify why there are three crosses.
