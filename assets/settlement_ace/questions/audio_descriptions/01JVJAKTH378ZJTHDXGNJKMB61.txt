Ulster Fry is definitely a dish you'll want to associate with Northern Ireland, not Wales. Think of it as a regional specialty, much like haggis is to Scotland. It's a fried breakfast, usually including bacon, sausages, eggs, soda bread, potato bread, and often black and white pudding. It's a hearty meal, traditionally eaten on weekend mornings or special occasions. The key thing to remember is "Ulster" refers to a historical province in Ireland, and while it includes parts of the Republic of Ireland, it's most strongly associated with Northern Ireland. Wales, on the other hand, has its own distinct culinary traditions, like Welsh rarebit or laverbread, which are completely different. So, while both are part of the UK, their food cultures are quite separate. Getting them mixed up is a common mistake, but just remember Ulster = Northern Ireland, and you'll be fine!
