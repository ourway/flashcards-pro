Christmas, a Christian holiday celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, has been observed on December 25th for centuries. This date was chosen by the early Church in Rome, possibly to coincide with existing winter solstice festivals. The New Year, on the other hand, is celebrated on January 1st, marking the start of the Gregorian calendar year, which is the most widely used calendar system today. While both are celebrated during the winter holiday season, they are distinct events separated by about a week. So, because Christmas is firmly rooted in December and the New Year begins in January, the statement that Christmas is celebrated at the beginning of the New Year is simply incorrect. It's easy to get confused because they're both part of the festive season, but they are separate celebrations.
