Boxing Day, celebrated on December 26th, has roots that stretch back centuries. There are a few theories about its origins. One popular idea is that it started as a day when wealthy landowners would box up gifts and distribute them to their tenants and servants as a thank you for their year-round service. Another theory suggests it was the day alms boxes in churches were opened and the contents distributed to the poor. Regardless of the exact origin, Boxing Day became a bank holiday in the UK in 1871. It's traditionally a day for visiting family and friends, watching sports (especially football), and taking advantage of post-Christmas sales. So, because it follows immediately after the Christmas festivities on December 25th, Boxing Day is always celebrated on the day after Christmas Day.
