The conflict you're thinking of is known as "the Troubles." This wasn't just any disagreement; it was a particularly violent and complex period in Northern Ireland's history, lasting roughly from the late 1960s to the late 1990s. At its heart, it was a conflict between two main groups: Irish nationalists (mainly Catholics) who wanted Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and join a united Ireland, and unionists (mainly Protestants) who wanted Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK. The term "Troubles" is a bit of an understatement, really, considering the widespread violence, bombings, and political instability that characterized the era. While "the Problems" might sound like a reasonable alternative, "the Troubles" is the specific, widely recognized historical term used to describe this period. The Clearances refer to a different historical event involving the eviction of Scottish Highlanders, and the Great Depression was a global economic crisis, so neither of those fit the context of Irish independence.
