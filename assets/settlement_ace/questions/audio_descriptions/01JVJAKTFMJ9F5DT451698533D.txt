The Battle of Bannockburn, fought in 1314, is a pivotal moment in Scottish history. It represents Scotland's struggle for independence from England. At this time, England, under Edward II, was trying to assert its control over Scotland. Robert the Bruce, also known as Robert I, had claimed the Scottish throne and was leading the resistance. The battle itself took place near Stirling Castle, a strategically important location. Robert the Bruce's leadership was crucial to the Scottish victory. He employed clever tactics and inspired his troops to fight fiercely for their freedom. While figures like King Alfred the Great and William the Conqueror are important in English history, they predate this event. Edward I, known as the "Hammer of the Scots," was indeed a key figure in the conflicts between England and Scotland, but he died before Bannockburn. Therefore, Robert the Bruce is the only correct answer because he was the commander who led the Scottish army to this decisive victory, securing a period of Scottish independence.
