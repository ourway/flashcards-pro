Sir Francis Chichester's solo circumnavigation is a celebrated moment in British maritime history. Before him, sailing around the world alone was considered incredibly challenging and dangerous. In 1966, at the age of 65, Chichester set sail from Plymouth in his yacht, Gipsy Moth IV. His journey wasn't just a leisurely cruise; he faced treacherous weather, equipment failures, and the sheer isolation of being alone at sea for months. He navigated using traditional methods, relying on celestial navigation and his own skill. After a journey of over 226 days at sea, with one stop in Australia, he returned to Plymouth in 1967, becoming the first person to achieve a single-handed circumnavigation via the clipper route. This route is longer than sailing around the equator, making his accomplishment even more impressive. So, the statement is true because Sir Francis Chichester did indeed achieve this remarkable feat, solidifying his place as a pioneering sailor.
