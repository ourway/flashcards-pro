World War II, a global conflict lasting from 1939 to 1945, saw the United Kingdom aligned with a coalition of countries against the Axis powers. The Soviet Union, despite initial non-aggression pacts with Germany, eventually joined the Allied forces after being invaded in 1941. Poland was one of the first countries invaded by Nazi Germany, triggering the start of the war and fighting alongside the Allies from the outset. France, although occupied by Germany for a period, had a government-in-exile that continued to fight with the Allies. Japan, however, was a key member of the Axis powers, allied with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought the United States into the war against the Axis. Therefore, Japan was definitely not an ally of the UK during World War II; it was a major enemy.
