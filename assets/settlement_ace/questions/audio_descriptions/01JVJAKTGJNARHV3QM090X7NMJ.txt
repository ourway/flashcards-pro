Forced marriage is a serious human rights issue, and the UK has very strict laws against it. The key word here is "forced." Think about what that means: someone is being compelled to do something against their will. Consent is absolutely essential for a valid marriage. If one or both people getting married are not able to freely and willingly agree to the marriage, then it's considered forced. This lack of consent can stem from various forms of pressure, including physical violence, emotional manipulation, or even threats against the person or their family. The UK government takes a strong stance against forced marriage to protect individual autonomy and prevent abuse. So, the answer is yes, a marriage where one or both parties can't or won't consent is indeed a forced marriage. It's important to remember that cultural or religious traditions can never justify forcing someone into marriage.
