Okay, let's talk about 10 Downing Street. This address is iconic, but it's not just any old house. It's the official residence and the office of the British Prime Minister. Think of it like the UK's version of the White House. The Prime Minister doesn't actually *own* the building, of course; it's a government building. But, by convention, whoever holds the office of Prime Minister lives there and conducts much of their work there. It's been the Prime Minister's official residence since 1735, when Sir Robert Walpole, often considered the first Prime Minister, was given it by King George II. While the Queen has many residences, like Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, and Prince Charles, now King Charles III, resides in Clarence House, 10 Downing Street is specifically tied to the office of the Prime Minister. The President of the United States has no connection to the UK government or its residences. So, while the Royal Family are very important figures in the UK, 10 Downing Street is the domain of the Prime Minister.
