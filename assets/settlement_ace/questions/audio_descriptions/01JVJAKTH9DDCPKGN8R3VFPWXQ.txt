Political parties in the UK rely heavily on grassroots activism to spread their message and gain support. Think of them as large teams working towards a common goal. A key part of that involves directly engaging with the public. Handing out leaflets is a classic way to inform people about the party's policies and candidates. It's a simple, direct method of communication. Similarly, knocking on doors, or "canvassing," allows party members to have face-to-face conversations with potential voters, answer their questions, and persuade them to support the party. While it might be tempting to think joining a party means you'll be involved in high-level parliamentary activities, that's generally reserved for elected officials. And while political disagreements can be passionate, violent clashes are illegal and unacceptable in a democratic society like the UK. So, the most common and accessible activities for ordinary party members are those that involve direct public engagement: handing out leaflets and knocking on doors.
