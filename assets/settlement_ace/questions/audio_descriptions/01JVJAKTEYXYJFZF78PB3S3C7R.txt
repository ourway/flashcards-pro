The story of the Huguenots is a fascinating, if somber, chapter in European history. They were French Protestants who followed the teachings of John Calvin during the 16th and 17th centuries. In predominantly Catholic France, this made them a target. The French Wars of Religion, which lasted for much of the late 16th century, saw intense conflict between Catholics and Huguenots. Even after periods of relative peace, they faced systematic discrimination and persecution. The most infamous event was the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572, where thousands of Huguenots were killed. Later, in 1685, the Edict of Nantes, which had granted them some religious freedom, was revoked. This led to a mass exodus of Huguenots from France. Britain, being a Protestant country, offered a safe haven. Skilled artisans, merchants, and professionals were among those who sought refuge, enriching British society with their talents and contributing significantly to industries like weaving and clockmaking. So, their primary motivation for migrating was to escape the religious persecution they faced in France. While war and famine could certainly be factors in migration, the specific religious targeting of the Huguenots makes "religious persecution" the most accurate answer.
