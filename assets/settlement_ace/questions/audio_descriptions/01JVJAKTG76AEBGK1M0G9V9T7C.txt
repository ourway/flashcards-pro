Okay, let's delve into the English Civil War to understand why "Cavaliers" is the right answer. Back in 1642, England was deeply divided, and this division erupted into a civil war. On one side, you had King Charles I, who believed in the divine right of kings â€“ the idea that he was appointed by God to rule. His supporters were largely nobles, landowners, and members of the Church of England. They were known as Cavaliers. The term "Cavalier" originally meant "horseman" or "knight," and it was used to describe these royalist supporters, often seen as dashing and aristocratic. On the other side were the Parliamentarians, who opposed the king's absolute power and wanted more say in how the country was governed. They were nicknamed "Roundheads" because many of them had short haircuts, a stark contrast to the long, flowing hair of the Cavaliers. So, while Roundheads were the opposition, Cavaliers were specifically the king's supporters during that tumultuous time. The Quakers were a religious group that emerged later in the 17th century, and the Chartists were a 19th-century movement advocating for political reforms, so neither of those groups were involved in the 1642 conflict.
