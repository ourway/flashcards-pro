In 1945, the British public was ready for a change after the long years of World War II. While Winston Churchill had been a powerful and inspiring leader during the war, the public felt that the country needed someone with a different vision to rebuild Britain. The Labour Party, led by Clement Attlee, offered a plan for social reform, including the creation of the National Health Service and a commitment to full employment. Attlee's Labour Party won a landslide victory in the 1945 general election, and he became Prime Minister. So, while Churchill was a pivotal wartime leader, it was Attlee who took office immediately after the war to guide Britain through the post-war era. Harold Wilson and Harold Macmillan were Prime Ministers, but much later, in the 1960s.
