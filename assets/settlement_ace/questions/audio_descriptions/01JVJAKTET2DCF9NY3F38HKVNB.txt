Terrorism poses a serious threat to the UK's safety and security, and everyone has a role to play in preventing it. The UK government has a counter-terrorism strategy called CONTEST, which aims to reduce the risk of terrorism. A key part of this strategy involves encouraging people to report any suspicious activity or concerns they may have about individuals who might be involved in terrorist activities. If someone attempts to recruit you into a terrorist cause, they are committing a serious crime. Therefore, the most appropriate action is to immediately notify the police. They have the expertise and resources to investigate the situation, assess the threat, and take necessary steps to protect you and the wider community. While informing friends or contacting other agencies might seem helpful, the police are the primary point of contact for terrorism-related concerns because they are equipped to handle the situation effectively and confidentially. Delaying reporting or choosing an alternative contact could hinder the investigation and potentially put others at risk.
