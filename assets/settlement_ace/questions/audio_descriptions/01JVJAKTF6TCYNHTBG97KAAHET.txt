Scotland, despite not being the first place that comes to mind when you think of skiing, actually has a decent number of ski resorts. The Scottish Highlands, with their rugged mountains, create the perfect environment for winter sports. The key here is to remember that there are five main ski centres spread across the Highlands. These aren't huge, sprawling resorts like you might find in the Alps, but they offer a unique skiing experience. The five centres are Glencoe, Nevis Range, Cairngorm Mountain, Glenshee, and The Lecht. While the snow conditions can be variable, depending on the year, these centres provide opportunities for skiing and snowboarding. So, while you might be tempted to think there are fewer, or perhaps a surprisingly large number, the correct number to remember for the test is five.
