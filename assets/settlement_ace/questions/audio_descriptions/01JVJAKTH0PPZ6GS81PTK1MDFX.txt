Okay, let's break down the role of ministers in the UK government. The Prime Minister is indeed responsible for forming the government, and that involves appointing ministers. These ministers are Members of Parliament, or sometimes members of the House of Lords, who take on specific responsibilities for running government departments. Think of it like the CEO of a company choosing their senior management team. However, the key thing to remember is the scale. While there are many MPs in Parliament, only a select few become ministers. The Prime Minister typically appoints around 20 senior MPs to head up the main government departments like the Home Office, the Treasury, or the Department for Education. These individuals form the Cabinet, which is the main decision-making body in the government. While there are other junior ministers who assist in these departments, the number of senior ministers in charge is significantly less than 80. So, while it might seem like a large number of MPs would be ministers, the reality is that only a relatively small group holds these key positions.
