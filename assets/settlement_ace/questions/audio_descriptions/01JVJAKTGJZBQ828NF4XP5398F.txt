Patron saints are special saints chosen to be protectors of a particular place or group. England's patron saint is Saint George, famous for his legendary defeat of a dragon, and Wales' is Saint David. While St. George's Day on April 23rd and St. David's Day on March 1st are days of cultural significance and are celebrated with parades, festivals, and sometimes wearing national symbols like the Welsh daffodil or the English rose, they are not public holidays in England and Wales. Public holidays, also known as bank holidays, are set by law and provide days off work for many people. It's easy to think that because these saints are so important to national identity, their days would be official holidays, but that's not the case. The UK's public holidays are mostly religious (like Christmas and Easter) or secular (like New Year's Day and the late summer bank holiday). So, while these days are culturally important, you won't get a day off work automatically!
