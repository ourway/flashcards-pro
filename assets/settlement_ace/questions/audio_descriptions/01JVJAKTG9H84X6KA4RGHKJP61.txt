The clock tower at the Palace of Westminster, more commonly known as the Houses of Parliament, is one of London's most iconic landmarks. While many people refer to the entire tower as "Big Ben," that's actually the nickname for the Great Bell housed inside. This massive bell weighs over 13 tons and has been chiming the hour since 1859. The name "Big Ben" is thought to have come from Sir Benjamin Hall, who was the Commissioner of Works at the time the bell was installed; he was a rather large man, hence the "Big" moniker. So, while the tower itself is impressive, it's the sound of Big Ben that truly resonates with people, marking the passage of time and broadcasting the heart of British democracy. It's not named after a children's character or cartoon, but a real person involved in its creation.
