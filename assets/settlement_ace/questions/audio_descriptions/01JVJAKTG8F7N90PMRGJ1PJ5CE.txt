The Cenotaph in Whitehall, London, is a national war memorial, playing a central role in Remembrance Day ceremonies. The word "cenotaph" itself comes from the Greek, meaning "empty tomb," and it symbolizes the loss of life in war. The original temporary Cenotaph was erected in 1919 after World War I, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, as a focal point for victory celebrations. It proved so popular that a permanent structure, made of Portland stone, replaced it in 1920. Every year, on Remembrance Sunday, the Sunday nearest to November 11th (Armistice Day, marking the end of World War I), the Cenotaph is the site of a national service of remembrance. Members of the Royal Family, politicians, and military leaders lay wreaths to honour those who have died in conflict. While museums preserve history and churches provide spiritual solace, the Cenotaph serves specifically as a place of national mourning and remembrance for war casualties. It's not a garden, but a solemn monument in a public space.
