Okay, let's talk about the 2012 London Olympics and Paralympics. While the UK, and London specifically, has hosted many international sporting events, 2012 was a really special year. The Olympic Games, featuring athletes from all over the world competing in a huge range of sports, were a massive success. But right after the Olympics finished, London also hosted the Paralympic Games. These games are an international competition for athletes with disabilities, and they're just as important and exciting as the Olympics. They showcase incredible talent and determination. The World Cup is a football tournament, and while England is a major footballing nation, the World Cup wasn't held there in 2012. EURO 2012, the European football championship, was held in Poland and Ukraine. The Commonwealth Games, which involves countries that used to be part of the British Empire, wasn't in London that year either. So, while all those events are significant, the Paralympic Games are the correct answer because they directly followed the Olympics in London in 2012, making it a unique and memorable year for British sport.
