Parliamentary proceedings are meticulously documented to ensure transparency and accountability. While secretaries are involved in administrative tasks, they don't create the official record of debates. Similarly, while radio broadcasts may occasionally cover Parliament, they aren't the primary method of documentation, and Morse code is a relic of the past! The two key methods are TV broadcasts and Hansard. Television cameras record the sessions, providing a visual record of who said what. But even more importantly, Hansard is the official, verbatim report of what is said in Parliament. It's named after Thomas Curson Hansard, a printer who began publishing these reports in the early 19th century. Hansard is not just a summary; it's a near-word-for-word transcript, making it the definitive written record. So, while a tape recorder might capture audio, Hansard and TV provide the comprehensive, official documentation.
