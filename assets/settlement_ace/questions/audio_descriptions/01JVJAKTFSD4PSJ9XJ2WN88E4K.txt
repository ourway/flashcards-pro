Okay, let's talk about Scottish independence and one of its biggest heroes, Robert the Bruce. The Battle of Bannockburn, fought in 1314, was a *huge* turning point in the long struggle between Scotland and England. For years, the English had been trying to assert their control over Scotland, but Robert the Bruce, who had claimed the Scottish throne, wasn't having any of it. He was determined to secure Scotland's freedom. Bannockburn wasn't just a battle; it was a decisive victory for the Scots, solidifying Robert the Bruce's position as King and effectively confirming Scotland's independence from English rule at that time. King Charles I and King James I were much later monarchs, ruling centuries after Bannockburn, and while significant in British history, they weren't involved in this particular struggle for Scottish independence. As for Admiral Nelson, he was a naval hero famous for battles at sea, not land battles like Bannockburn. So, when you think of Bannockburn and Scottish independence, remember Robert the Bruce â€“ he's the key figure.
