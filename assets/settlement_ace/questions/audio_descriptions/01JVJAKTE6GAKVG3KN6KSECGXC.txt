The UK's story is one of dramatic urbanization, especially since the Industrial Revolution. Back in the 18th and 19th centuries, factories sprung up in towns and cities, drawing people from the countryside in search of work. This led to massive population growth in urban areas. While the UK has beautiful rural landscapes, the vast majority of people, over 80%, actually live in towns and cities. So, when we think about where most people call home, it's definitely in urban areas. You might be tempted to think of rolling hills and quaint villages, but the reality is that the UK is a highly urbanized nation. This concentration of population in cities has shaped everything from the economy to culture and even the political landscape.
