The story of Charles II's escape after the Battle of Worcester in 1651 is one of the most famous tales from the English Civil War period. After his royalist forces were defeated by Oliver Cromwell's Parliamentarians, Charles was a wanted man, his life in grave danger. He couldn't simply ride away or hide in any ordinary place because Cromwell's troops were actively searching for him. The future king had to be incredibly resourceful and rely on the loyalty of his supporters. That's where the Royal Oak comes in. Charles famously hid in a large oak tree in the grounds of Boscobel House in Shropshire. This wasn't just any tree; it was a particularly dense oak, providing excellent cover. He spent a whole day concealed amongst its leaves and branches, literally looking down on the soldiers searching for him. This daring act of hiding in the oak tree allowed him to evade capture and eventually make his way to the coast and then to safety in Europe. The oak tree became a symbol of his escape and is still known as the Royal Oak today, with many pubs across the UK named in its honour.
