The Battle of Britain, fought in 1940, was a pivotal moment in World War II. After the evacuation of Dunkirk, Britain stood alone against Nazi Germany. Hitler planned to invade, but first, he needed to gain air superiority. This is where the Battle of Britain comes in. It was essentially an air campaign fought entirely *in the skies* above Britain. The German Luftwaffe relentlessly bombed British airfields, radar stations, and cities, trying to cripple the Royal Air Force (RAF). British fighter pilots in Spitfires and Hurricanes bravely defended their country. The battle raged throughout the summer and autumn of 1940. The RAF's success in preventing the Luftwaffe from gaining air superiority forced Hitler to postpone his invasion plans, a turning point in the war. While other battles happened at sea or on land, the Battle of Britain was unique because it was fought and won in the air.
