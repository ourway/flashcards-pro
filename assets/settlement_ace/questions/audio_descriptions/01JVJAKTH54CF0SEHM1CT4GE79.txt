Charlie Chaplin's "Tramp" is one of the most iconic characters in film history, instantly recognizable even today. Silent films relied heavily on visual storytelling, and Chaplin mastered this art. He created the Tramp character around 1914, a lovable but hapless vagrant with a toothbrush mustache, baggy trousers, oversized shoes, and a cane. The Tramp's appeal lay in his resilience and optimism in the face of adversity. He was a symbol of the common man, struggling against the odds but always maintaining his dignity and humor. Chaplin's films, like "The Kid" and "Modern Times," often tackled social issues, making them both entertaining and thought-provoking. While actors like Richard Burton, David Niven, and Sir Rex Harrison were all accomplished British actors, they came to prominence much later, during the era of sound film, and are not associated with silent film comedy or the Tramp character. Chaplin's Tramp remains a defining figure of the silent film era, making him the clear and correct answer.
