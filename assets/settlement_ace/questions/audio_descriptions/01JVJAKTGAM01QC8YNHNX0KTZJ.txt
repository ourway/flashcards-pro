The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 56 independent and equal countries, almost all of which were formerly part of the British Empire. It's rooted in history, going back to the early 20th century as Britain's colonies began gaining independence. The aim was to maintain friendly cooperation and trade links. Queen Elizabeth II was the Head of the Commonwealth, a symbolic role reflecting the shared history. Now, King Charles III holds that position. Canada is a key member of the Commonwealth. It was one of the first Dominions to gain self-governance within the British Empire, a process formalized in the Statute of Westminster in 1931. Canada maintains strong cultural and political ties with the UK and other Commonwealth nations. The USA, having gained independence much earlier through revolution, was never part of the British Empire in the same way and therefore isn't a member. Similarly, Panama and Norway also have no historical ties to the British Empire, making Canada the only correct answer.
