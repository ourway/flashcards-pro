Okay, let's talk about the history of motor-car racing in the UK. The very early 1900s were a time of huge technological advancement, and the motor car was right at the forefront of that. While cars had been invented earlier, they were still quite new and a bit of a novelty. The first official motor race in Britain took place in 1902. It was called the Speed Trials and was held in Bexhill-on-Sea. This location was chosen because it had a long, straight stretch of road perfect for testing the speed of these new machines. Before this, there were some informal races, but 1902 marks the year when organized motor-car racing really began in the UK. So, while 1802 and 1852 are way too early – cars hadn't even been invented yet! – and 1952 is too late, as motor racing was already well established by then, 1902 is the correct year. It's a fascinating glimpse into a time when the world was just starting to embrace the possibilities of the automobile.
