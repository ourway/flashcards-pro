The National Assembly for Wales, now known as the Welsh Parliament or Senedd, has evolved significantly in its law-making powers since its creation in 1999. Initially, it had very limited powers, primarily focused on secondary legislation and advising the UK government on Welsh matters. However, through a series of Government of Wales Acts, particularly those in 2006 and 2017, its authority has expanded considerably. The 2017 Act was especially crucial, as it established the Senedd as a permanent part of the UK's constitutional arrangements and granted it the power to pass laws on devolved matters without needing the explicit agreement of the UK Parliament. These devolved matters include areas like health, education, and local government. While the UK Parliament technically retains the power to legislate on any matter, including those devolved to Wales, convention dictates that it generally doesn't do so without the Senedd's consent. So, the statement is true because the Senedd can now independently pass laws within its devolved areas of responsibility.
