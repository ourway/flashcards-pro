Winston Churchill's name is almost synonymous with World War II. While he had a long and impactful political career spanning both World Wars, his leadership during the Second World War, from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955, is what he's most remembered for. Think of his iconic speeches, like "We shall fight on the beaches," which rallied the British public during the darkest days of the war. He became Prime Minister after Neville Chamberlain resigned, precisely because Britain needed a strong leader to face the Nazi threat. World War I, on the other hand, concluded in 1918, long before Churchill took on the role of Prime Minister. During that earlier conflict, he held various government positions, but not the top job. So, while he was involved in both wars, his premiership is firmly linked to the Second World War, making that the correct answer.
