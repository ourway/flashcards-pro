1947 was a pivotal year in the dismantling of the British Empire, particularly in South Asia. After World War II, Britain's resources were stretched thin, and the calls for independence from its colonies grew louder. India, a jewel in the crown of the Empire, finally achieved its independence on August 15, 1947, leading to the creation of two separate nations: India and Pakistan. Sri Lanka, then known as Ceylon, also gained its independence from British rule in 1948, just a year later. However, the Caribbean islands followed a different trajectory. While some islands had already achieved independence or were self-governing, many remained under British control as colonies or protectorates well into the 20th century. For example, Jamaica didn't gain independence until 1962, and others followed suit later. So, while India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka were celebrating their newfound freedom in the late 1940s, the Caribbean was still largely under British influence.
