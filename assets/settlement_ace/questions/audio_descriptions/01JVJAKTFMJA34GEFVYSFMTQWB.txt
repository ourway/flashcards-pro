The Northern Ireland Assembly operates a bit differently than other UK legislative bodies, and its size has actually changed over time. Initially, after the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, the Assembly had 108 members. This was designed to ensure broad representation from different political viewpoints. However, in 2017, the number of Members of the Legislative Assembly, or MLAs, was reduced. Currently, the Northern Ireland Assembly has 90 members, with each of the 18 parliamentary constituencies returning five MLAs. So, the statement that the Northern Ireland Assembly has 120 members is incorrect. It's important to remember this change, as the Assembly's composition reflects the ongoing evolution of Northern Ireland's political landscape.
