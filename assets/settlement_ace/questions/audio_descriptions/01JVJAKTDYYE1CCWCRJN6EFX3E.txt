The National Anthem, "God Save the King (or Queen)," is deeply embedded in British national identity and tradition. Its origins trace back to the mid-18th century, gaining popularity during a time of Jacobite rebellions. Over time, it evolved into a symbol of loyalty to the monarch and the nation. The tune itself is quite recognizable and has even been adopted by other countries. Because of its historical significance and the reverence it commands, the National Anthem is reserved for moments of national importance. You'll hear it played at state occasions, royal events, and major national celebrations, signifying respect for the Crown and the country. While drums, guitars, or euphoniums might feature in various musical performances, they lack the specific historical and symbolic weight associated with the National Anthem in representing the nation and the monarchy.
