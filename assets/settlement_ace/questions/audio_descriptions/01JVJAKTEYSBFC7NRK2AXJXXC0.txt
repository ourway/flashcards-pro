Think about the age of exploration, a time when European powers were racing to map the world and establish trade routes. Sir Francis Drake, a famous English explorer, was a key figure in this era. In 1577, he set sail on an expedition that would make history. While he started with a small fleet, it was his flagship, originally named the Pelican, that completed the circumnavigation. During the voyage, Drake renamed it the Golden Hind, in honour of his patron, Sir Christopher Hatton, whose family crest featured a golden hind (a female deer). This voyage, lasting from 1577 to 1580, was the second circumnavigation of the world in a single expedition, proving that the world was indeed round and opening up new possibilities for trade and exploration. The other ships listed are significant in British naval history, but none of them were the first to achieve this global milestone. HMS Victory is famous for the Battle of Trafalgar, and the Royal Yacht Britannia served the royal family for many years, but the Golden Hind holds the unique distinction of being the first ship to circle the globe.
