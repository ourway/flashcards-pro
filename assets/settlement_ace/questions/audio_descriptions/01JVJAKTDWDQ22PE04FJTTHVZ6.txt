Halloween, celebrated on the 31st of October, has roots stretching back to ancient Celtic traditions. Specifically, it originates from the Celtic festival of Samhain, which marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter, a time of year often associated with death. The Celts believed that on the night of October 31st, the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead blurred. They would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off evil spirits. Over time, as Christianity spread, Samhain evolved into All Hallows' Eve, the night before All Saints' Day. The traditions of costumes, trick-or-treating, and carving pumpkins are all relatively modern additions, but the core date of October 31st remains the same, linking us back to those ancient Celtic beliefs and practices. So, while the other options might be the end of a month, only October 31st holds this historical and cultural significance related to Halloween.
