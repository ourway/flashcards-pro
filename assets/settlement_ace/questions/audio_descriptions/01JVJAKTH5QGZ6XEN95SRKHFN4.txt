In Scotland, the legal system has some unique features that set it apart from England and Wales, and one of those is the size of the jury. While in many parts of the world, including England and Wales, you'll find juries of 12 people, in Scotland, a jury consists of 15 individuals. This difference stems from the historical development of the Scottish legal system, which has its own distinct traditions and procedures. The larger jury size is intended to ensure a broader range of perspectives and a more robust deliberation process when deciding on a verdict. So, when you think about Scottish juries, remember they're a bit bigger than you might expect â€“ 15 good people making important decisions.
