The Belfast Agreement, also known as the Good Friday Agreement, was a pivotal moment in Northern Ireland's history, aiming to bring an end to decades of conflict known as "The Troubles." Signed in April 1998, it laid the groundwork for a new power-sharing government. A key element of the agreement was the establishment of the Northern Ireland Assembly, designed to give the people of Northern Ireland a greater say in how they were governed. The Assembly was intended to be up and running very soon after the agreement was signed, so the correct answer is 1998. While there were earlier attempts at power-sharing and assemblies in Northern Ireland, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, these unfortunately didn't last due to ongoing political instability. The 1998 Assembly, born out of the Good Friday Agreement, represented a more comprehensive and hopefully lasting effort to bring peace and stability to the region.
