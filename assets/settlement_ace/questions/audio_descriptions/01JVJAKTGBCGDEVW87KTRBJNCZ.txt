Okay, let's break down how the UK government actually works. Think of the government as a complex machine with many moving parts. Parliament is the legislative branch, meaning it's responsible for making and changing laws. It's made up of the House of Commons, where elected Members of Parliament debate and vote on legislation, and the House of Lords, which scrutinizes and revises bills. Now, laws don't just magically implement themselves. That's where the Civil Service comes in. The Civil Service is a body of non-political, professional government employees who support the government in developing and implementing policies and delivering public services. They're the people behind the scenes ensuring everything runs smoothly, from healthcare to education to transport. Local people and businesses, while important to society, aren't actually part of the formal structure of the government itself. They are impacted by the government and can influence it, but they don't form its core components.
