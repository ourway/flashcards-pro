Okay, let's break down why it's true that some bishops from the Church of England have seats in the House of Lords. This stems from the historical role of the Church in English society and governance. Back in the medieval period, the Church held immense power and influence, owning vast lands and playing a key role in advising the monarch. This influence translated into representation in Parliament. Even after the Reformation, when the Church of England separated from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century under Henry VIII, the Church retained a formal connection to the state. This connection is symbolized by the monarch being the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. As a result, a specific number of senior bishops, known as Lords Spiritual, are granted seats in the House of Lords. These bishops contribute to debates on legislation, bringing a moral and ethical perspective to parliamentary discussions. Currently, there are 26 Lords Spiritual. So, while it might seem unusual in a modern democracy, this arrangement reflects the historical ties between the Church and the state in England.
