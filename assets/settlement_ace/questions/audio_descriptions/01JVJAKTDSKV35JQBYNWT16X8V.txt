Okay, let's talk about patron saints and bank holidays in the UK! The UK is a union of different countries, each with its own distinct history and traditions. Part of that identity is linked to their patron saint. Now, while England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland all have patron saints – St. George, St. Andrew, St. David, and St. Patrick respectively – not all of their feast days are public holidays. St. Patrick's Day in Northern Ireland and St. Andrew's Day in Scotland are officially recognized with bank holidays. It's a way to celebrate their cultural heritage and national identity. England's St. George's Day on April 23rd and Wales' St. David's Day on March 1st aren't bank holidays, although there have been campaigns to make them so. So, the statement is true because only Scotland and Northern Ireland have made their patron saint's day an official holiday. You might think that because St. George is so well-known, his day would be a holiday, but it isn't currently!
