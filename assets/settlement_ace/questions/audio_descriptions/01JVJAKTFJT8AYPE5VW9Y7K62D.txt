The story of the UK and Europe is a long and complex one! The European Economic Community, or EEC, was established in 1957 with the Treaty of Rome. Six countries – Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands – were the initial members, aiming to create a common market. The UK initially stayed out, hesitant to relinquish sovereignty and prioritizing trade with the Commonwealth. However, by the 1960s, the UK realized the economic benefits of joining and applied for membership. Charles de Gaulle, the French President, vetoed the UK's application twice, fearing Britain's close relationship with the United States. It wasn't until de Gaulle left office that the path was cleared. In 1973, under Prime Minister Edward Heath, the UK finally joined the EEC. This was a significant turning point in British history, integrating the UK more closely with continental Europe. The other answer options are incorrect because they predate the UK's successful application and entry into the EEC.
