"Auld Lang Syne" is practically synonymous with New Year's Eve, or Hogmanay as it's known in Scotland. The song is all about remembering old friends and good times, and it's sung in many countries around the world as the clock strikes midnight. The words were written by Robert Burns, Scotland's national poet, in 1788. Burns didn't actually write the melody, he collected it from a traditional folk song. He then added his own verses, transforming it into the song we know today. Burns was a prolific poet, writing in both Scots and English, and his works often celebrated Scottish culture and the lives of ordinary people. While Isaac Newton was a brilliant scientist, known for his laws of motion, and Howard Florey and Ernest Rutherford made huge contributions to medicine and physics respectively, none of them had anything to do with writing poetry or songs, especially not the iconic "Auld Lang Syne." So, when you think of that New Year's Eve tradition, remember it's thanks to the poetic genius of Robert Burns.
