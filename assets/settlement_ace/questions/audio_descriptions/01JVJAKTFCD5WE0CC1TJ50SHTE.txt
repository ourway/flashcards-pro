Okay, so every Member of Parliament, or MP, representing their own constituency is indeed true. Think of the UK as being divided into smaller geographical areas called constituencies. Each of these areas has its own election, and the person who wins that election becomes the MP for that specific constituency. This system ensures that different parts of the country have someone directly representing their interests in Parliament. It's a bit like having a local voice in the national conversation. The UK is currently divided into 650 constituencies, so there are 650 MPs in the House of Commons. This system has evolved over centuries to ensure fair representation. While some might think MPs represent a political party first, the core principle is that they are there to represent the people who elected them in their constituency.
