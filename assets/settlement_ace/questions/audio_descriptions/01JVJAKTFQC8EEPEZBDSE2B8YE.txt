The UK has been at the forefront of many scientific breakthroughs, and cloning is certainly one area where British scientists have made significant contributions. When we think about the first cloned mammal, the name that usually springs to mind is Dolly. Dolly the sheep was indeed the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell, a feat achieved by scientists at the Roslin Institute in Scotland in 1996. This was a huge deal because it proved that cells from adult mammals could be used to create a whole new animal, opening up possibilities in regenerative medicine and other fields. So, while British scientists were pioneers in cloning technology, the first mammal they cloned wasn't a rabbit. It was Dolly, the famous sheep. It's easy to get mixed up because cloning is complex, but remembering Dolly's Scottish origins helps clarify that the statement about a rabbit being the first cloned mammal is incorrect.
