The Scottish Parliament, established in 1999 after a referendum showed strong public support for devolution, is responsible for making laws on many issues that affect daily life in Scotland, like education, health, and the environment. It's a key part of Scotland's identity and governance. Now, when it comes to the number of Members of the Scottish Parliament, or MSPs, think of it this way: there are 129 of them. These MSPs are elected to represent different constituencies and regions across Scotland. They debate issues, propose new laws, and hold the Scottish government to account. The number 129 is fixed by law to ensure fair representation. While other numbers might sound plausible, remembering that specific number will help you on the test and give you a better understanding of how Scotland's government works.
