The rose has been England's national flower since the Wars of the Roses in the 15th century. This brutal civil war was fought between two families vying for the English throne: the House of Lancaster, symbolized by a red rose, and the House of York, represented by a white rose. When Henry Tudor, who belonged to the House of Lancaster, defeated Richard III of York in 1485, he married Elizabeth of York. This union symbolically merged the two houses, and the Tudor rose, combining both red and white, became a symbol of peace and unity. It's been associated with England ever since, appearing on royal coats of arms and other emblems. While the daffodil is associated with Wales, the thistle with Scotland, and the shamrock with Ireland, it's the rose that holds the historical and cultural significance as the floral emblem of England.
