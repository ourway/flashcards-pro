Before 1969, the voting age in the UK wasn't the same for everyone. Men could vote at 21, but women had to be 30, a difference rooted in historical anxieties about women's political judgment. The Representation of the People Act in 1969 changed all that, lowering the voting age to 18 for both men and women. This was a significant step towards equality and recognised the growing participation of young people in society. It reflected a broader cultural shift, with the late 1960s being a time of social change and youth activism. While women had gained some voting rights earlier in the 20th century, it wasn't until 1969 that the playing field was leveled in terms of age, making it a landmark year for gender equality in the UK's electoral history. So, while women had the right to vote before 1969, it was in this year that they were given the right to vote at the age of 18, same as men.
