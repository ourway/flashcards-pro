The Northern Ireland Assembly, established as part of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, is a key institution for devolved government in Northern Ireland. The aim was to create a power-sharing executive between unionist and nationalist parties. However, the path hasn't always been smooth. Due to disagreements and breakdowns in trust between the parties, the UK government has, on several occasions, had to step in and suspend the Assembly. These suspensions are a significant intervention, essentially putting direct rule from Westminster back in place temporarily. Notable suspensions occurred in 2002, due to a breakdown in trust over paramilitary activity, and again for a prolonged period between 2017 and 2020, following a disagreement between the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn FÃ©in. So, while the goal is for a stable, locally-led government, history shows the UK government *has* used its power to suspend the Assembly when political crises demanded it. Therefore, it's false to say the UK government has *never* suspended the Northern Ireland Assembly.
