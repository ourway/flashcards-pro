Criminal law deals with actions that are considered harmful to society as a whole. Think of it as the set of rules that protect us all. When someone breaks these rules, like committing theft or assault, the state – usually through the police or local council – investigates. If there's enough evidence, the case goes to court. The key thing here is that the punishment, if found guilty, is decided by the court. This is different from other types of law, like civil law, which deals with disputes between individuals. So, because criminal law focuses on actions investigated by authorities and punished by courts, it directly relates to "crimes." Civil law, on the other hand, deals with disputes between individuals or organizations, and common law is based on legal precedents set by past court decisions.
