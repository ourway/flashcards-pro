Wales is where the Welsh language, also known as Cymraeg, has its strongest roots and most speakers. The Welsh language is a Celtic language, a family of languages that includes Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Breton. While you might hear some Welsh spoken in other parts of the UK or even abroad due to Welsh emigration, Wales is the heartland of the language. It's been spoken there for over 1500 years, predating the arrival of English. Today, Welsh is a living language, taught in schools, used in government, and featured in media. Road signs are bilingual, and you'll hear it spoken in everyday conversations. Although other regions have their own languages and dialects, Welsh is specifically associated with Wales, making it the only correct answer. It's a key part of Welsh national identity and a testament to the country's unique cultural heritage.
