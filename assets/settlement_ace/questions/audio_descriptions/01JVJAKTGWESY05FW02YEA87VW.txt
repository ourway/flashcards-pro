Wales is one of the four countries that make up the United Kingdom, alongside England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Think of the UK as a political union of these four distinct nations, each with its own history and culture. The term "integral part" means that Wales is fundamentally and constitutionally part of the UK. This union has evolved over centuries, with Wales formally becoming part of the Kingdom of England in the 16th century through the Laws in Wales Acts. While Wales has its own language, the Welsh language, and distinct cultural identity, it's governed by the UK Parliament in Westminster. St Helena, the Channel Islands, and Canada, while having historical connections to the UK, are not integral parts of the United Kingdom itself. St Helena is a British Overseas Territory, the Channel Islands are Crown Dependencies, and Canada is an independent Commonwealth country. So, while these places have links to the UK, they aren't part of the core political entity that is the United Kingdom.
