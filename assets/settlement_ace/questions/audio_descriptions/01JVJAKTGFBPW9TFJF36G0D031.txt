Okay, let's talk about the Church of England and its spiritual leader. The Church of England is an Anglican church, and itâ€™s important to remember that it separated from the Roman Catholic Church way back in the 16th century during the reign of King Henry VIII. He wanted to divorce his wife, and when the Pope wouldn't allow it, Henry declared himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England. Now, while the monarch still holds the title of Supreme Governor, the *spiritual* leader is someone different. That person is the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Archbishop is based at Canterbury Cathedral, which is considered the mother church of the Anglican Communion worldwide. They are responsible for leading the Church's spiritual direction, overseeing its bishops, and playing a key role in major religious ceremonies. So, while the Queen is important, her role is more symbolic and administrative. The Pope, of course, leads the Roman Catholic Church, not the Church of England. And the Peers are members of the House of Lords, which is part of Parliament, so they are involved in law-making, not spiritual leadership.
