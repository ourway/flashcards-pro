Okay, let's break down why defence and immigration are *not* controlled by the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Think of it this way: these devolved governments have significant power over things that directly affect their local populations, like healthcare and education. They can tailor these services to the specific needs of their regions. However, defence and immigration are fundamentally national issues. Defence, naturally, concerns the protection of the entire United Kingdom, requiring a unified strategy and command structure. Immigration policy, similarly, impacts the whole country, affecting border control, citizenship, and overall population management. Allowing each region to set its own immigration rules, for example, would create chaos and undermine the UK's national sovereignty. So, while health and education are devolved, defence and immigration remain firmly under the control of the UK Parliament in Westminster to ensure consistency and national security. It's a division of power designed to balance local needs with national unity.
