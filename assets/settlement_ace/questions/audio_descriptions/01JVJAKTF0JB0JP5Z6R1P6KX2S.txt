The Victorian era, named after Queen Victoria, spanned from 1837 to 1901, a period of immense change and innovation in Britain. Think of it as a time of industrial revolution, social reform, and the expansion of the British Empire. Florence Nightingale, known as "The Lady with the Lamp," revolutionized nursing during the Crimean War (1853-1856), which falls squarely within the Victorian period. Her work dramatically improved hospital conditions and established nursing as a respected profession. Similarly, Isambard Kingdom Brunel was a brilliant engineer who designed bridges, railway lines, and ships, all vital to Britain's industrial growth during this time. He built the Great Western Railway, the Clifton Suspension Bridge, and the SS Great Britain, all iconic examples of Victorian engineering. Dylan Thomas was a Welsh poet who rose to prominence much later, in the 20th century. Margaret Thatcher, of course, was a Prime Minister in the late 20th century, long after the Victorian era had ended. Therefore, Nightingale and Brunel are the figures who fit perfectly within the historical timeline and context of the Victorian period.
