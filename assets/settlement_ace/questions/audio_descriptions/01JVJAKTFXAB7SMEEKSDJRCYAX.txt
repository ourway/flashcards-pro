The story of cloning is a fascinating one, and the names you really need to remember for the Life in the UK test are Sir Ian Wilmut and Keith Campbell. They were the dynamic duo behind the first successful cloning of a mammal, Dolly the sheep, back in 1996 at the Roslin Institute in Scotland. This was a huge scientific breakthrough because, before Dolly, it was widely believed that adult mammal cells couldn't be used to create a clone. Wilmut and Campbell proved this wrong with a technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer, which is a fancy way of saying they took the DNA from an adult sheep cell and put it into an egg cell. While other scientists have contributed to cloning research, Wilmut and Campbell are the ones specifically credited with this first successful animal cloning. You might be familiar with Ernest Rutherford, but he was a pioneering nuclear physicist, famous for his work on radioactivity and the structure of the atom much earlier in the 20th century. James Goodfellow, on the other hand, invented the Personal Identification Number (PIN), so while important, neither of them were involved in cloning.
