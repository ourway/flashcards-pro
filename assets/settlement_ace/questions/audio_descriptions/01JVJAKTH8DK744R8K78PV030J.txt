Okay, let's talk about Iron Age defenses. During the Iron Age, which in Britain ran roughly from 800 BC to the Roman invasion in 43 AD, people needed to protect themselves and their communities. Think about it: resources were valuable, and raiding was common. So, what did they do? They built hill forts. These weren't just any old settlements on hills; they were specifically designed for defense. The strategic advantage of building on a hill is obvious – you can see attackers coming from a distance, and it's harder for them to reach you. These forts typically consisted of earth ramparts, ditches, and wooden palisades, making them formidable obstacles. Now, you might be thinking about barrows, which are burial mounds. While barrows, like round barrows, were definitely a feature of the landscape during the Bronze Age and earlier, they weren't primarily defensive structures. Skara Brae, on the other hand, is a Neolithic village in Scotland, way before the Iron Age, and wasn't designed as a defensive structure either. So, when you think Iron Age defense, think hill forts – strategically placed and built for protection.
