Ireland in the 17th century was a complex tapestry of religious and political tensions. Predominantly Catholic, Ireland had been under English rule for centuries, a rule that intensified with the rise of Protestantism in England. The English Reformation led to the establishment of the Church of England, and later, the emergence of Puritanism, a more radical form of Protestantism seeking to "purify" the Church. In Ireland, the existing Catholic population viewed both the established Church of England and the growing Puritan movement with suspicion and fear. They saw these Protestant factions as threats to their religious freedom, land ownership, and cultural identity. The Puritans, with their strong anti-Catholic sentiments, were particularly alarming to Irish Catholics, who feared further suppression of their faith and way of life. So, the correct answer is Ireland because it was there that Roman Catholics felt most threatened by the increasing influence of the Puritans, who were seen as a direct challenge to their religious and cultural survival.
