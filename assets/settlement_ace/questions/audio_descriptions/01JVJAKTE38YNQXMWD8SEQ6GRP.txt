The UN Security Council is all about maintaining peace and security on a global scale. Think of it as the world's emergency response team for serious international problems. It was established after World War II in 1945, when countries realized they needed a better way to prevent future conflicts. The Security Council's main job is to investigate any situation that might lead to international friction, recommend ways to settle disputes peacefully, and, if necessary, authorize actions like economic sanctions or even military intervention to restore peace. So, when you see "international crises and threats to peace," that's exactly what triggers the Security Council to take action. While promoting democracy and development are important UN goals, the Security Council's specific mandate is focused on preventing and resolving conflicts that endanger global stability.
