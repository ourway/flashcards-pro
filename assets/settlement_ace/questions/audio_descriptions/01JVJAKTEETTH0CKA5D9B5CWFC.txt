Okay, let's talk about women in the British workforce. Historically, women's participation in the workforce was significantly lower than men's, especially before and during the early 20th century. Traditional societal roles often confined women to domestic duties. However, major shifts occurred during both World Wars when women stepped into roles previously held by men, demonstrating their capabilities and contributing significantly to the war effort. Over the decades, legislation promoting equal opportunities, coupled with changing social attitudes and increased access to education, have paved the way for greater female participation. Today, women constitute a substantial portion of the UK workforce, making up approximately half of it. While there's still work to be done in terms of equal pay and representation in senior positions, the current reality is a near-equal split. So, if you thought women only made up a quarter of the workforce, that would be way off the mark and wouldn't reflect the progress made in gender equality in employment.
