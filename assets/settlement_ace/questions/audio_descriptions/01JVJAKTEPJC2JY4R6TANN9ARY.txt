St. Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha form a British Overseas Territory, but it's crucial to understand the distinction between that and being part of the United Kingdom itself. The UK is a sovereign state located in Europe, comprising Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) and Northern Ireland. British Overseas Territories, on the other hand, are territories that have a historical link with the UK, often remnants of the British Empire. While the UK government is responsible for their defence and international relations, these territories have their own governments and laws. St. Helena, a remote volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean, is one such territory. It's famous for being the place of Napoleon Bonaparte's final exile and death in 1821. So, even though St. Helena has strong ties to Britain, its distinct governance and geographical location mean it's not part of the UK. Thinking they are the same is a common mistake, but remembering the difference between a sovereign state and an overseas territory will help you get this right.
