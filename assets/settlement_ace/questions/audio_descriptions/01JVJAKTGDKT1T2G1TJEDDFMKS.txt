Greenwich, a borough of London, is steeped in maritime history and known for its Royal Observatory, the Prime Meridian Line, and the Cutty Sark. However, in more recent times, it's also become a major entertainment hub. The O2, originally known as the Millennium Dome, is a large entertainment district on the Greenwich Peninsula. Built to mark the year 2000, it initially faced criticism but has since been transformed into a highly successful arena, hosting concerts, sporting events, and other large-scale performances. The SECC, now known as the SEC, is actually in Glasgow, Scotland. The Copenhagen Concert Hall is, as the name suggests, in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the Auditorio de Tenerife is located in the Canary Islands, Spain. Therefore, the O2 is the only venue listed that is actually located in Greenwich, making it the correct answer.
