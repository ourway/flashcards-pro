John Logie Baird was a Scottish inventor and engineer, and he's considered one of the pioneers of television. While the very first experimental television broadcasts happened earlier, 1932 is significant because it marks the first long-distance television transmission. Baird successfully transmitted images between Glasgow and London. This was a huge technological leap at the time, demonstrating the potential of television to connect people across geographical distances. It wasn't 1920, as television technology was still in its infancy then. 1945 and 1955 are also incorrect because they fall much later, after television broadcasting had already become more established and widespread following Baird's initial breakthrough. So, 1932 is the year to remember for that groundbreaking broadcast connecting Glasgow and London.
