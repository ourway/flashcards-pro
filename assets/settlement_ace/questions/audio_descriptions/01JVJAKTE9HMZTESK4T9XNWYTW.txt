Okay, let's talk about Ireland at the start of the Middle Ages. When we think of the Middle Ages, roughly from the 5th to the 15th centuries, Ireland was a very different place than it is today. It was divided into several kingdoms, each with its own king, laws, and customs. These kingdoms were independent of each other and, crucially, independent of any outside rule. This period, often called Early Medieval Ireland or the Early Christian Period, saw a flourishing of Irish culture, with the development of Gaelic traditions, the spread of Christianity, and the creation of beautiful illuminated manuscripts like the Book of Kells. The influence of England hadn't yet taken hold in a significant way. English settlements and direct rule came much later, primarily starting in the late 12th century. So, at the beginning of the Middle Ages, Ireland definitely existed as an independent entity, or rather, a collection of independent kingdoms. It's easy to get confused because we often think of Ireland's later history under British rule, but that's a much later chapter in the story.
