The age at which you become a full citizen in the UK, with all the rights and responsibilities that come with it, is 18. Think of it as the age you're considered an adult in the eyes of the law. One of the key civic duties in the UK is jury service, which is a really important part of the legal system. Juries are made up of ordinary people who decide whether someone is guilty or not guilty in a court case. Because this is such a serious responsibility, it's reserved for adults. That's why you have to be at least 18 years old to serve on a jury. It's the same age you can vote in elections, enter into contracts, and buy alcohol â€“ all things that require a certain level of maturity and understanding. While 16-year-olds can do many things, like leave school and get married with parental consent in some cases, they aren't considered fully responsible for making these serious legal decisions like serving on a jury.
