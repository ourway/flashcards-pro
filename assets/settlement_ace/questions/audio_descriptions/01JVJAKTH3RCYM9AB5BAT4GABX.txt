Charles II, who reigned from 1660 after the Restoration, was a big supporter of the arts and sciences. This period saw a real blossoming of intellectual curiosity in England. Think about it: after years of Puritan rule under Cromwell, there was a thirst for new ideas and exploration. Charles II actively encouraged this. The Royal Society, one of the world's oldest and most respected scientific organizations, was officially founded in 1660, right at the beginning of his reign. While it wasn't *formed* by Charles II himself, he granted it a Royal Charter in 1662, giving it official recognition and royal patronage. This support was crucial for the Society's early development and helped establish science as a legitimate and important field of study. So, while he didn't personally conduct experiments, his interest and backing were vital to the Royal Society's success, making the statement true. It's easy to think monarchs were only interested in power, but Charles II saw the value in scientific advancement.
