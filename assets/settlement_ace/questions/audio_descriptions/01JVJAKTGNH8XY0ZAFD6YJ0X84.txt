Stormont is the name of the estate in Belfast where the Northern Ireland Assembly meets. To understand why this is the answer, it helps to know a bit about the history of Northern Ireland. After decades of conflict, the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 established a power-sharing government. The Northern Ireland Assembly, formed as a result of this agreement, is responsible for making laws on devolved matters, things like education, health, and the environment. Stormont was chosen as the location for this assembly because it already housed government buildings and had symbolic importance. The other options are incorrect because Holyrood is where the Scottish Parliament meets in Edinburgh, Westminster is home to the UK Parliament in London, and the Senedd is the Welsh Parliament in Cardiff. So, if you're thinking about Northern Ireland's government, remember Stormont as the place where their elected representatives gather to make decisions.
