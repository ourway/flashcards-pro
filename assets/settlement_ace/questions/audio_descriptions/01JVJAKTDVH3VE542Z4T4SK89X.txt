The UK's National Anthem, "God Save the Queen" (or "God Save the King" when there's a male monarch), is more than just a song; it's a symbol of loyalty to the Crown and the nation. Its origins are a bit murky, but it gained popularity in 1745 during a time of Jacobite rebellions, when people sang it to express support for King George II. The tune itself might be even older, possibly dating back to the 17th century. What's interesting is that the anthem isn't actually established by law or royal proclamation; it's simply become the standard through custom and usage. So, while "Queen reign over the UK," "God Save the UK," and "United we stand" might sound patriotic, they aren't the recognized words of the official anthem used at state occasions, sporting events, and royal celebrations. The focus is specifically on praying for the monarch's well-being and long reign, hence "God Save the Queen/King."
