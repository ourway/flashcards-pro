The struggle for women's suffrage in the UK was a long and hard-fought battle spanning decades. While 1969 might seem like a plausible date for progress, it's actually much earlier when women achieved equal voting rights. Initially, the Representation of the People Act in 1918 granted voting rights to women over the age of 30 who met certain property qualifications. This was a significant step, but it still excluded many women. It wasn't until ten years later, in 1928, with the passing of the Representation of the People Act, that women finally achieved equal voting rights with men. This act lowered the voting age for women to 21, matching the existing requirement for men. So, while 1969 saw other social changes, the landmark achievement of women over 21 gaining the right to vote occurred much earlier, solidifying 1928 as the pivotal year.
