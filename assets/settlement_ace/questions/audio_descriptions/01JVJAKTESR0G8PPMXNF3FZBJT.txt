Sir Steve Redgrave is a British icon, celebrated as one of the greatest Olympians of all time, and that's why he's the answer here. His incredible achievement was winning gold medals in rowing at five consecutive Olympic Games, from 1984 in Los Angeles all the way to 2000 in Sydney. This feat is extraordinary because rowing is a physically demanding sport, requiring immense stamina and dedication over many years. He won gold in different boat classes, showing his versatility. Now, while Sir Chris Hoy is a fantastic cyclist with multiple Olympic golds, his sport is different. Dame Ellen MacArthur is famous for sailing, not rowing, and Sir Roger Bannister is remembered for breaking the four-minute mile in athletics. Redgrave's five consecutive golds are unique in British sporting history, making him a household name and a true legend of the Olympics.
