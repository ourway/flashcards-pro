The National Lottery is a popular form of gambling in the UK, but it's regulated to protect young people. The key thing to remember here is the age restriction. While many things become accessible at 18, like voting or buying alcohol, the age to participate in the National Lottery is actually 16. This was changed in 2021; previously, it was also 16, but there was a brief period where it was raised to 18 before being lowered again. So, if the question suggests that those under 18 are prohibited, that's incorrect. Sixteen and seventeen-year-olds *can* legally buy lottery tickets and participate. It's a common misconception that all gambling activities have an 18+ age limit, but the National Lottery makes an exception. This is because it's seen as a relatively low-risk form of gambling, and the proceeds go to good causes.
