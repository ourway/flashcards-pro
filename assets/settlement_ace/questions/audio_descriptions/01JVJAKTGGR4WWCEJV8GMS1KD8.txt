To vote in any major election in the UK – whether it's for Members of Parliament, local councillors, or even European elections when the UK was still part of the EU – you absolutely must be on the electoral register. Think of it like this: the electoral register is the official list of everyone who's eligible to vote. It's how the government knows who's allowed to participate in the democratic process. Registering isn't automatic; you have to actively sign up. This is done to prevent voter fraud and ensure that only eligible citizens are casting ballots. The register is updated regularly, and you need to re-register if you move to a new address. So, being on the electoral register is a fundamental requirement for exercising your right to vote; without it, you won't be able to participate. It's a simple but crucial step in ensuring a fair and accurate election.
