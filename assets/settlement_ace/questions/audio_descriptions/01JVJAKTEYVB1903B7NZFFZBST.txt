Okay, let's clear up the relationship between the Church of England and Scotland. While the Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church, is indeed the official state church in England, things are different north of the border. Scotland has its own national church, called the Church of Scotland, which is a Presbyterian church. This stems from the Scottish Reformation in the 16th century, where Scotland adopted a Presbyterian system of church governance, meaning it's governed by elders, not bishops like in the Anglican Church. The Church of Scotland is sometimes called "the Kirk," which is Scots for "church." Although there is also a Scottish Episcopal Church, which is part of the Anglican Communion, it is not the national church. So, while Anglicanism exists in Scotland, the Church of England isn't the official church there; that role belongs to the Church of Scotland.
