Alright, let's talk about 1066 and why it's such a pivotal year in British history. Before 1066, England was ruled by Anglo-Saxon kings. Think of figures like Alfred the Great. However, in January 1066, King Edward the Confessor died without a clear heir, leading to a succession crisis. Several people laid claim to the throne, including William, the Duke of Normandy, who argued that Edward had promised him the crown. This set the stage for the Norman invasion. William landed his forces in England in September 1066, and the decisive Battle of Hastings took place on October 14th. William's victory marked the end of Anglo-Saxon rule and the beginning of the Norman era. This invasion had a massive impact, introducing Norman French language, feudalism, and a new aristocracy that reshaped English society, law, and culture. So, while the Romans did leave England much earlier, and the Battle of Bannockburn was a significant event in Scottish history, 1066 is synonymous with the Norman invasion because it fundamentally changed the course of English history.
