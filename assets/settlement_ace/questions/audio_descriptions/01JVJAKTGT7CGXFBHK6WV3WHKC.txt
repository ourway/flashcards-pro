The Crimean War, fought in the mid-1850s against Russia, highlighted the need for a system to recognize exceptional bravery amongst all ranks of the British armed forces. Before this, medals were often awarded based on rank or for long service, not necessarily for acts of valor in the face of the enemy. Queen Victoria, recognizing this gap, instituted the Victoria Cross in 1856. It was specifically designed to be awarded regardless of social standing, making it accessible to ordinary soldiers and sailors who displayed extraordinary courage. The medal itself is made from bronze taken from Russian cannons captured during the war, adding a symbolic layer to its significance. While the Elizabeth Medal exists, it's a much more recent creation, established in 2009 to recognize the families of service personnel killed in action or as a result of terrorism. The Medal of Honor is a United States military decoration, so it wouldn't be relevant to the British context.
