The small claims procedure exists to provide a more accessible route to justice for everyday disputes. Imagine you've had a disagreement with a builder over shoddy work, or a retailer refuses to refund a faulty product. Going through the full court system for relatively small amounts of money can be incredibly expensive and time-consuming, often costing more than the actual claim itself! The small claims procedure, which is part of the County Court system, offers a simplified and less formal way to resolve these issues. It's designed to be user-friendly, so people can represent themselves without needing a lawyer. This keeps costs down and makes the legal system more accessible to everyone. The focus is on finding a fair resolution quickly and efficiently, without the complexities of traditional court proceedings. So, the correct answer highlights this informal and cost-effective way to settle minor disputes.
