The Bayeux Tapestry is a massive embroidered cloth, almost 70 meters long, that vividly depicts the events leading up to and including the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. This conquest was a pivotal moment in British history, marking the end of Anglo-Saxon rule and the beginning of Norman influence, which shaped the English language, law, and culture. The tapestry tells the story of William, Duke of Normandy, claiming the English throne after the death of King Edward the Confessor and his subsequent victory over the English forces. Specifically, it focuses on the Battle of Hastings, where William's Norman army defeated King Harold's forces. The other battles listed are important, but they aren't depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry. The Battle of Britain was a 20th-century air battle, Culloden was a Jacobite rebellion battle in the 18th century, and Waterloo was where Napoleon was defeated in 1815. So, while all significant battles, the Bayeux Tapestry is uniquely dedicated to illustrating the events of the Battle of Hastings.
