The National Assembly for Wales, now known as the Welsh Parliament or Senedd, operates with a unique linguistic landscape. While Welsh is a vibrant and officially recognised language in Wales, English is also widely spoken. The key here is understanding that the Senedd aims to be inclusive and accessible to all its constituents. Therefore, members, known as MSs (Members of the Senedd), are permitted to speak in either Welsh or English during proceedings. This bilingual approach ensures that all members can fully participate and that the debates are understandable to a broader audience. Allowing only Welsh would exclude those who don't speak the language, while restricting it to English would disregard the significance of the Welsh language to the nation's identity. The Senedd provides simultaneous translation services to facilitate communication between members who choose to speak in different languages. So, while Welsh is valued and used, English is also an accepted language for parliamentary debates.
