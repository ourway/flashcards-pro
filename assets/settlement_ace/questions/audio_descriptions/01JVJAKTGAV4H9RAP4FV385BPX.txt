Hanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, is a Jewish festival commemorating the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem during the Maccabean Revolt in the 2nd century BCE. The story goes that when the Maccabees reclaimed the Temple, they found only enough consecrated oil to light the menorah for one day. Miraculously, the oil lasted for eight days, giving them time to produce more. That's why Hanukkah is celebrated for eight nights. Each night, a candle on the menorah is lit, adding one each day until all eight candles are burning brightly. So, the eight days of Hanukkah directly commemorate this miracle of the oil lasting much longer than expected. While other Jewish holidays have different durations and significance, Hanukkah's length is specifically tied to this historical and religious event.
