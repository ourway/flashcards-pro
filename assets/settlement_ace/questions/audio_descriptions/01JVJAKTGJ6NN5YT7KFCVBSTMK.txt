The story of Anglo-Saxon England is one of many kingdoms gradually coming together. Think of it like a jigsaw puzzle slowly forming a picture. For centuries, England was divided into different Anglo-Saxon kingdoms like Mercia, Northumbria, and Wessex. Then, in the 9th century, the Vikings, mainly Danes, began raiding and settling in England, threatening to take over completely. King Alfred the Great, who ruled Wessex from 871 to 899, played a crucial role in stopping them. He famously built fortified towns called burhs, reorganized the army, and even created a navy to fight the Vikings at sea. While he didn't conquer all of England, Alfred successfully defended Wessex and negotiated a treaty that divided England, giving the Vikings control of the Danelaw in the north and east. His success in defending Anglo-Saxon lands and promoting a sense of English identity laid the foundation for a unified England under his successors. That's why King Alfred the Great is remembered as the monarch under whom the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms began to unite against the Viking threat. William of Orange came much later, in 1688, Henry VIII in the 16th century, and Robert the Bruce was a Scottish king.
