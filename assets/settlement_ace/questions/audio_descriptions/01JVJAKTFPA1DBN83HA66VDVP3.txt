Okay, let's break down why state retirement pensions and free school meals were introduced before World War I. Think back to the early 20th century, a time of significant social reform in Britain. There was growing awareness of poverty and inequality, and pressure on the government to do something about it. The Liberal government, in particular, introduced a series of measures aimed at improving the lives of ordinary people. The Old Age Pensions Act was passed in 1908, providing a small state pension for those over 70 with limited income. This was a huge step, as previously, many older people faced destitution. Then, free school meals were introduced in 1906, recognizing that children from poorer families couldn't learn effectively if they were hungry. Now, the National Health Service (NHS) is a much later creation, established in 1948 after World War II, as part of the post-war welfare state. Similarly, Child Benefit payments are a more recent development, designed to support families with the cost of raising children. So, while the NHS and Child Benefit are important parts of the UK's social safety net, they came about much later than the pre-World War I era when the first steps were taken with pensions and school meals.
