Okay, let's break down why Dunbar and Worcester are the key battles when we're talking about Cromwell's victories over the Scottish army. To understand this, we need to remember the period after the English Civil War. Charles I was executed in 1649, and England became a republic, or Commonwealth, led by Oliver Cromwell. However, Scotland still supported the monarchy and declared Charles I's son, Charles II, as their king. This led to a series of conflicts known as the Third English Civil War. The Battle of Dunbar in 1650 was a decisive victory for Cromwell, allowing him to occupy much of Scotland. However, Charles II wasn't defeated yet. He launched an invasion of England in 1651, but Cromwell met him at the Battle of Worcester. This was another crushing defeat for the Scottish Royalists, effectively ending their hopes of restoring the monarchy at that time. So, Dunbar and Worcester represent the two major battles where Cromwell directly defeated the Scottish army fighting for the Royalist cause. Bosworth Field was much earlier, marking the end of the Wars of the Roses. Hastings was, of course, the famous Norman victory in 1066, and Marston Moor was a key battle *during* the English Civil War, but not specifically against a Scottish army supporting Charles II.
