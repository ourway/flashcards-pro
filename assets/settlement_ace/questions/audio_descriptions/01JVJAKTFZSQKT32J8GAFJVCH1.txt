Okay, let's talk about the English Civil War and why the Cavaliers were on King Charles I's side. This conflict, which raged in the 1640s, was essentially a power struggle between the King and Parliament. Charles I believed in the divine right of kings, meaning he thought God had given him the authority to rule absolutely. Parliament, on the other hand, wanted more say in how the country was run, especially when it came to things like taxation and laws. Now, the Cavaliers were the supporters of King Charles I. The name "Cavalier" actually comes from the French word for "horseman" or "knight," and it was used, sometimes derisively, to describe the Royalist supporters, many of whom were wealthy landowners and members of the aristocracy. They were often seen as flamboyant and loyal to the traditional hierarchy. The Roundheads, conversely, were the Parliamentarians, named for their short haircuts, and they opposed the King. So, while the Roundheads were fighting for Parliament, the Cavaliers were the ones backing King Charles I, hoping to maintain the monarchy's power. The Suffragettes were a much later group fighting for women's right to vote in the early 20th century, and the Quakers are a religious group known for their pacifism.
