The thistle's association with Scotland goes way back, shrouded in legend. One popular story tells of a sleeping Scottish army saved from a surprise Viking attack when a Norseman stepped on a thistle, his cry of pain alerting the Scots. Whether that's true or not, the thistle became an important symbol, representing resilience and protection. It was adopted as a national emblem during the reign of Alexander III (1249â€“1286), and has appeared on Scottish coins since the 15th century. It's a powerful symbol of Scottish identity, representing the country's tough and independent spirit. The other options are national emblems too, but not of Scotland. The Shamrock is associated with Ireland, the Rose with England, and the Daffodil with Wales. So, while all beautiful flowers, only the Thistle embodies the spirit of Scotland.
