When a public body, like a government department or local council, oversteps its authority and infringes on someone's legal rights, the justice system steps in to provide a remedy. The courts have the power to ensure these bodies act lawfully and fairly. While simply asking for an explanation might seem like a first step, it's not enough to rectify the harm caused. The courts need to be able to enforce real change. Therefore, judges can order the public body to change its practices to prevent future violations. This might involve rewriting policies or retraining staff. Crucially, they can also order the body to pay compensation to the individual whose rights were violated. This compensation aims to address the damage or distress caused by the unlawful action. This power of the courts to order changes and compensation is a vital part of upholding the rule of law and protecting individual liberties against potential overreach by public bodies.
