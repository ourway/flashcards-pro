The Middle Ages, roughly spanning from the 5th to the 15th century, was indeed a turbulent time marked by frequent warfare. Following the collapse of the Roman Empire, Europe fragmented into numerous kingdoms and principalities, constantly vying for power and territory. Think of the Viking raids that terrorized coastal communities for centuries, starting in the late 8th century. Then you have the Norman Conquest of 1066, a pivotal moment that reshaped England through warfare. The Hundred Years' War between England and France (1337-1453) was a particularly long and devastating conflict. Even within kingdoms, internal conflicts like the Wars of the Roses in 15th-century England saw noble families battling for the throne. While there were periods of relative peace, the overall picture is one of near-constant conflict, making "true" the accurate response. It's easy to imagine peaceful medieval villages, but the reality was that war, or the threat of war, was a constant presence in people's lives.
