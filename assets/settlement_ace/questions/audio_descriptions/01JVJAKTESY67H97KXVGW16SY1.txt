To understand why you don't need to be 21 to run for Parliament, it helps to think about the fundamentals of British democracy. The UK operates on the principle of universal suffrage, meaning almost all adult citizens have the right to vote and participate in the political process. A key part of that participation is the ability to stand for election. The age at which you gain full adult rights, including the right to vote, is 18. This was lowered from 21 in 1969, reflecting a broader societal shift towards recognizing the maturity and civic responsibility of younger adults. Therefore, it logically follows that if you are old enough to choose your representatives, you are also old enough to *be* a representative. The minimum age to stand for election to the House of Commons is also 18. So, while some might assume a higher age is required for such an important role, the UK system aligns the right to vote with the right to stand for office, empowering young adults to actively shape the country's future.
