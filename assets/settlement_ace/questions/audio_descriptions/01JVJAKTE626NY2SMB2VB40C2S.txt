The UK Parliament, housed in the Palace of Westminster, is a working building where laws are debated and made. Because it's a democratic institution, the public has a right to observe parliamentary proceedings. This is why free entry is possible. Both the House of Commons and the House of Lords have public galleries where you can watch debates and sessions. While booking in advance is often recommended, especially for popular debates or during busy tourist seasons, you can usually gain entry on the day by queuing at the public entrance. Keep in mind that security checks are in place, and entry isn't guaranteed, as it depends on available space. It's a great way to witness British democracy in action firsthand.
