Okay, let's talk about the Battle of Bannockburn and why it's so important in British history. In the early 14th century, Scotland was fighting for its independence from England. Robert the Bruce, a key figure in Scottish history, led the Scottish army. The Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 was a pivotal moment in this struggle. The Scottish, against the odds, decisively defeated the English army. This victory was a major turning point, solidifying Scotland's de facto independence, even though it wasn't formally recognised immediately. While there were still conflicts with England afterwards, Bannockburn was crucial in ensuring Scotland remained unconquered by the English at that time. It's a powerful symbol of Scottish national identity and resistance, remembered even today. So, the statement is true because Bannockburn was a real victory that helped Scotland maintain its independence during that period.
