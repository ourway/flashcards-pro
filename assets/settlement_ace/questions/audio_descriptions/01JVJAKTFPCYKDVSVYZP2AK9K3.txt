Social networking platforms are all about connecting people online to share information, ideas, personal messages, and other content. Think of them as virtual town squares where people gather. Facebook, launched in 2004, allows users to create profiles, share updates, join groups, and connect with friends and family. Twitter, established in 2006, is a microblogging platform where users post short messages called "tweets," often used for news, quick updates, and public conversations. Both platforms have become integral parts of modern communication and are used by millions worldwide. Therefore, Facebook and Twitter are the correct answer because they are specifically designed for social interaction and sharing content with a wide network of people. While email and telephone are communication tools, they are primarily for direct, one-to-one or small group communication, not for broadcasting information across a social network.
