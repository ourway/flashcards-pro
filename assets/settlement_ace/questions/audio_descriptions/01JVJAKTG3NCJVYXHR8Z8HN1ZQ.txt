Life in 19th-century Ireland was, unfortunately, marked by significant hardship and challenges, especially when compared to other parts of the United Kingdom. A key factor was the reliance on potato farming. The devastating Great Famine, which began in 1845, was triggered by potato blight, a disease that destroyed potato crops. This led to widespread starvation and disease, drastically reducing the population through death and emigration. While industrialisation was progressing in other parts of the UK, Ireland remained largely agrarian, making it more vulnerable to agricultural crises. Land ownership was also a major issue, with many Irish farmers working as tenants for British landlords, often under harsh conditions. So, while other regions of the UK were experiencing the benefits of industrial growth and relative stability, Ireland faced immense difficulties, making living conditions generally less favorable.
