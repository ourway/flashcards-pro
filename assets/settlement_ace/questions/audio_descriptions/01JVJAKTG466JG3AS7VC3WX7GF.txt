The Ulster Fry is a traditional breakfast dish from Northern Ireland, and it's a hearty way to start the day! Think of it as Northern Ireland's answer to the full English breakfast. The key to understanding the Ulster Fry lies in its core components. While variations exist, the foundational elements that define it are sausage and bacon. These are the non-negotiable ingredients that you'll find in virtually every Ulster Fry. Other items like eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, and even soda bread and potato bread are often included, but sausage and bacon are the essential building blocks. So, while oatmeal or beef might feature in other dishes, they simply aren't part of the traditional Ulster Fry experience. Remembering that sausage and bacon are the base will help you nail this question every time.
