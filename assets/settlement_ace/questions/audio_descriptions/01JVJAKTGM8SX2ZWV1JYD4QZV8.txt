The European Union is an economic and political partnership involving many European countries. It grew out of the aftermath of World War II, with the initial aim to foster economic cooperation and prevent future conflicts. Over the decades, it has evolved into a single market allowing free movement of goods, services, capital, and people. The number of member states has changed over time as new countries joined, and, more recently, as the UK left. At the time of the Life in the UK test's publication, the correct number of countries in the EU was 28. It's easy to remember this because February typically has 28 days. While other numbers might seem plausible, they don't reflect the actual composition of the EU at that time.
