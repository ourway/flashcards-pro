The Proms, short for the Promenade Concerts, are a quintessential part of the British summer. They're not just any music festival; they're an eight-week-long daily celebration of classical orchestral music, primarily held at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The tradition began in 1895, founded by Robert Newman and conductor Henry Wood, with the aim of bringing classical music to a wider audience. The name "Promenade Concerts" comes from the fact that originally, people could walk around (promenade) during the concert, especially in the cheaper standing areas. While the format has evolved, the Proms retain their accessible spirit, offering a mix of popular classics and new commissions. The BBC has been broadcasting the Proms since 1927, further expanding its reach. So, when you think of 'the Proms,' remember it's this specific, long-standing orchestral music tradition, not a general awards show, a Welsh cultural festival, or musical comedies.
