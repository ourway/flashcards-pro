Okay, here's an explanation of why police forces are not independent from the government in the UK. The police operate within a framework of laws and regulations set by Parliament and the government. While individual officers have operational independence in making decisions about specific cases, the overall direction, funding, and legal powers of the police are determined by the government. For example, the Home Office is the government department responsible for policing. They set national policing priorities, allocate resources, and oversee police performance. Think of it like this: the government provides the rules of the game and the resources, while the police play the game according to those rules. So, while police officers aren't directly taking orders from politicians on a daily basis, they are ultimately accountable to the law and the government that creates and enforces those laws. It's a system of checks and balances to ensure the police serve the public interest within a democratic framework. Some might think the police are completely independent to avoid political interference in investigations, but the reality is that accountability and oversight are essential for maintaining public trust and ensuring the police operate effectively and fairly.
