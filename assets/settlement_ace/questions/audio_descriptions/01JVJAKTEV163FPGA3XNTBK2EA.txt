Boudicca, a name that echoes through British history, was the queen of the Iceni tribe in what is now Norfolk. Around 60 AD, when her husband died, the Romans, disregarding local customs, tried to seize her kingdom. They publicly flogged her and raped her daughters, sparking a fierce rebellion. Boudicca led the Iceni and other tribes in a devastating revolt, burning Roman settlements like Colchester, London, and Verulamium (modern-day St Albans). Although ultimately defeated by the Roman army, Boudicca became a symbol of resistance against foreign occupation and Roman oppression. Her story, passed down through Roman accounts and later retellings, embodies courage and defiance. While Elizabeth, Victoria, and Anne were all significant queens in British history, they lived centuries later and are not associated with resistance against the Roman Empire. Boudicca's rebellion is a key event in early British history, making her the correct answer.
