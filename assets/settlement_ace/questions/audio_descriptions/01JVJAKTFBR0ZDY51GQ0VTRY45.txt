During the 18th and 19th centuries, Britain underwent a massive transformation known as the Industrial Revolution. Before this period, agriculture was indeed the dominant source of employment for centuries. However, the invention of new machines like the steam engine and the power loom dramatically changed the landscape. These inventions led to the rise of factories and mass production, particularly in industries like textiles, coal mining, and iron production. As factories sprung up across the country, especially in urban centers, people migrated from rural areas to find work. This shift meant that manufacturing jobs, offering regular wages and new opportunities, gradually overtook agriculture as the primary source of employment. Think of cities like Manchester and Birmingham, which exploded in population and became major industrial hubs during this time â€“ they were magnets for those seeking work in the booming manufacturing sector. While agriculture remained important, it was manufacturing that defined the British economy and job market during those pivotal centuries.
