Henry VIII's reign in the 16th century was a period of significant change, not just in England but also in its relationship with Ireland. Before Henry, English monarchs were styled as "Lord of Ireland," a title that acknowledged the Pope's ultimate authority. However, Henry, driven by his desire to divorce Catherine of Aragon and establish himself as the head of the Church of England, broke with Rome. To solidify his power and eliminate any papal claim over Ireland, he declared himself "King of Ireland" in 1541. This was a crucial move to assert English sovereignty and bring Ireland under direct rule, marking a shift from feudal lordship to a more centralized kingdom. While other monarchs like Charles II and James VI (also James I of England) certainly played roles in Irish history, Henry VIII was the one who fundamentally changed the monarchical title to "King of Ireland," reflecting his ambition and the growing power of the English crown. Henry VII, his father, predates this shift in power and title.
