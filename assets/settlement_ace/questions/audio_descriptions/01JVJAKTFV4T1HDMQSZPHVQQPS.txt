England and Wales are famous for their stunning gardens, reflecting a long history of landscape design and horticultural passion. Sissinghurst Castle Garden in Kent, England, is a prime example of the "garden rooms" style, created by Vita Sackville-West and Harold Nicolson in the 1930s. It's celebrated for its romantic design, featuring distinct garden areas each with its own character and color scheme. Bodnant Garden, located in North Wales, showcases a diverse collection of plants from around the world, thanks to generations of the Aberconway family's dedication. Its famous Laburnum Arch, a tunnel of golden flowers, is a breathtaking sight in late spring. So, Sissinghurst and Bodnant Garden are the correct answer because they are both well-known, historically significant gardens, while the London Eye is a modern landmark and Snowdonia is a national park, not a specific garden.
