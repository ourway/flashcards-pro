Wales, like the other nations within the UK, has a special day to celebrate its patron saint. This is a tradition that goes back centuries, linking national identity with religious figures who played important roles in the country's history. The correct answer is St David's Day, celebrated on March 1st. Saint David, or Dewi Sant in Welsh, is the patron saint of Wales, and the date marks the traditional day of his death in 589 AD. Celebrations often involve wearing daffodils or leeks – both national symbols of Wales – and traditional Welsh food like Welsh cakes. You might be tempted by St. George's Day, but that's for England, or St. Andrew's Day, which is for Scotland. St. Francis's Day has no association with any of the UK's patron saints. So, remember, daffodils and leeks on March 1st – that's St David's Day in Wales!
