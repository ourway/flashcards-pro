Okay, here's an explanation of why the Union Jack is the correct answer:

The flag we know as the Union Jack is actually a combination of three different national flags, representing the union of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The flag was created in stages. First, in 1606, after England and Scotland shared a monarch, James I, the flags of England (St. George's Cross, a red cross on a white background) and Scotland (St. Andrew's Cross, a white saltire on a blue background) were combined. Then, in 1801, when Ireland formally joined the United Kingdom, the St. Patrick's Cross (a red saltire on a white background) was incorporated. The term "Union Jack" is the popular name, and it's thought to come from the fact that the flag was flown on the jackstaff of naval ships. While "Union Flag" is also correct, "Union Jack" is more commonly used. The other options are incorrect because the Royal Banner is a flag representing the monarch, the British Standard isn't a flag, and the St. George's Cross is only the flag of England, not the entire UK.
