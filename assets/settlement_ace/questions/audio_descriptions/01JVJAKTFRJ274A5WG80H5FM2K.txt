Okay, let's talk about UK currency. It's easy to assume there's a really high denomination banknote, but actually, the largest denomination of banknote currently in circulation in the UK is the £50 note. You might be thinking, "Well, why not a £100 note?" The reason is largely practical. Higher denomination notes can be more easily used for illegal activities like money laundering, and they're also less convenient for everyday transactions. Imagine trying to buy a pint of milk with a £100 note – you'd probably get some funny looks! While historically, larger denomination banknotes have existed, they're no longer part of the circulating currency. So, while a £100 note might sound plausible, it's simply not something you'll find in your wallet or at the bank today.
