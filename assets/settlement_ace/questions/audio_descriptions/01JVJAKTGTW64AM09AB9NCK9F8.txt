Okay, let's break down why disability and marital status are protected by law from discrimination. The UK has strong anti-discrimination laws, primarily under the Equality Act 2010. This act aims to protect people from unfair treatment based on certain characteristics. These are called 'protected characteristics'. Now, think about it: disability is a characteristic someone is born with or acquires, and marital status – whether you're married, single, divorced, or widowed – is a fundamental aspect of your personal life. The law recognizes that discriminating against someone because of these things is unjust. So, employers, service providers, and others can't treat you unfairly because you're disabled or because of your marital situation. On the other hand, things like your choice of benefit or car, or even your eye colour, aren't considered fundamental aspects of your identity that require legal protection from discrimination. While it might seem unfair to be judged on these things, they don't fall under the umbrella of protected characteristics defined by the Equality Act.
