Okay, let's talk about clans! The concept of clans, which are essentially extended families or kinship groups, owning land is deeply rooted in the history and social structure of both Scotland and Ireland. Think of it like this: for centuries, especially in the Highlands of Scotland and across Ireland, society wasn't organized in the same way as, say, England with its feudal system. Instead, powerful families, the clans, controlled territories and the people within them. These clans provided protection and a sense of belonging, and in return, clan members owed loyalty and service to their chief. This system was particularly strong before the formal establishment of centralized governments. While Wales has a rich history of family and community, and England certainly had powerful landowners, the clan system with its specific structure and land ownership wasn't a defining feature of their social organization in the same way it was in Scotland and Ireland. So, when you think of clans and land ownership, picture the Scottish Highlands and the green landscapes of Ireland â€“ that's where this system really flourished.
