Rugby's story begins in the early 19th century at Rugby School in Warwickshire, England. The popular story, though perhaps a bit embellished, credits William Webb Ellis, a student at the school, with picking up the ball and running with it during a football game in 1823. This act, a departure from the established rules of football at the time, is considered the genesis of rugby football. While forms of folk football existed for centuries, and other schools played variations, it was Rugby School that codified and popularized the specific rules that evolved into the modern game. The Rugby Football Union, the sport's governing body in England, was formed in 1871, further solidifying England's role in the sport's development. So, while the Vikings certainly had a significant impact on British history, they had nothing to do with the birth of rugby. The sport's origins are much more recent and specifically tied to an English school.
