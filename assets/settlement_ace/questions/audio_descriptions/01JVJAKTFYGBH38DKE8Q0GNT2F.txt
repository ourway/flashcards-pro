Edinburgh is really known as the 'Festival City' for a good reason! Every August, it hosts a collection of festivals, and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival is the biggest arts festival in the world. It started back in 1947, just after the Second World War, when eight theatre groups turned up uninvited to the Edinburgh International Festival. They weren't officially part of the main event, so they performed on the "fringe" of the festival. That's how it got its name! Now, it's a massive open-access festival, meaning anyone can perform. You'll find everything from theatre and comedy to dance and music, all crammed into venues across the city. While Liverpool, London, and Newcastle are all great cities with their own cultural events, none of them are as synonymous with a large arts festival like Edinburgh is with the Fringe. So, if you hear "Fringe Festival," think Edinburgh!
