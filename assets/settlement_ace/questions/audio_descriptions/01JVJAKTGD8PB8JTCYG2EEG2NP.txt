The Black Death was one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, primarily affecting Europe in the mid-14th century. It peaked between 1348 and 1350, wiping out an estimated 30% to 60% of Europe's population. The disease was caused by the bacterium *Yersinia pestis*, which is usually spread by fleas carried on rodents, particularly rats. The term "Black Death" likely comes from the black spots that appeared on the skin of many victims due to internal bleeding. Because of the sheer scale of death and the gruesome symptoms, it was a truly terrifying time. While battles, famines, and fires certainly caused suffering throughout history, none had the same widespread and devastating impact across the entire continent as this particular disease. So, when you hear "Black Death," think of a disease that ravaged Europe, not a battle, famine, or fire.
