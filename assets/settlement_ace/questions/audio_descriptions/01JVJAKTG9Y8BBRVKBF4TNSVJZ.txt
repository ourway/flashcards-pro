Chequers, officially known as Chequers Court, is more than just a house; it's a gift to the nation. It has served as the country residence of the Prime Minister since 1921. The house itself is steeped in history, dating back to the 16th century, and is located in Buckinghamshire. It was bequeathed to the government by Sir Arthur Lee, who wanted to provide a retreat for the Prime Minister, a place for them to relax, contemplate, and host important guests away from the pressures of Downing Street. So, while a Prime Minister might enjoy a chalet, cottage, or even a dormitory elsewhere, Chequers is the *official* country residence provided for them to use during their time in office. It's a symbol of the office itself, not just a personal holiday home.
