Christmas in the UK is steeped in tradition, and the Christmas Day meal is a central part of the celebrations. The tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day became popular in England during the Victorian era. Before that, other meats like goose, beef, or even a boar's head were common. Turkey became more affordable and widely available, solidifying its place as the centerpiece of the Christmas feast. Following the main course, Christmas pudding, a rich, dark, steamed pudding made with dried fruits and spices, is traditionally served. It's often doused in brandy and set alight before serving! Mince pies, small pastries filled with a mixture of dried fruits, spices, and suet (a type of fat), are another essential Christmas treat. They date back to medieval times, when they were originally filled with meat as well as fruit. So, roast turkey, Christmas pudding, and mince pies are the classic combination that makes up a traditional British Christmas Day meal. While pizza, burgers, and fish and chips are popular foods in the UK, they simply aren't part of the traditional Christmas dinner.
