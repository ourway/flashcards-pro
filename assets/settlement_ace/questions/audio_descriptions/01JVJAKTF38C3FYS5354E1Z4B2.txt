Okay, let's talk about the Muslim population in the UK. Islam is the second-largest religion in the United Kingdom after Christianity. The growth of the Muslim population has been quite significant over the last few decades, largely due to immigration and higher birth rates within the community. Now, while it's a growing and visible part of British society, it's important to get the numbers right. Around 4% of the total UK population identifies as Muslim. This figure is based on census data and surveys. So, while 5% or 6% might seem plausible, they are overestimations. And while 3% is close, it's actually a bit too low. The 4% figure reflects the most accurate representation of the Muslim population within the UK. It's a significant minority, contributing to the rich tapestry of cultures and faiths that make up modern Britain.
