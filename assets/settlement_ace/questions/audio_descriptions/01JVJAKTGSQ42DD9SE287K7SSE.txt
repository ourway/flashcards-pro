Sikhism, originating in the Punjab region of India in the 15th century, is a relatively young religion compared to many others in the UK. Sikhs began migrating to Britain in larger numbers after World War II, often filling labor shortages. The 1950s and 60s saw significant immigration, and Sikh communities established themselves across the country, particularly in areas like Southall, Birmingham, and Leicester. While Sikhism is a vibrant and important part of the UK's multicultural fabric, representing a significant contribution to British society, Sikhs constitute approximately 1% of the total UK population. This makes them a visible, but smaller, religious group compared to, say, Christians or Muslims. The other percentages offered as answers are incorrect because they either overestimate or underestimate the actual proportion of Sikhs within the UK population.
