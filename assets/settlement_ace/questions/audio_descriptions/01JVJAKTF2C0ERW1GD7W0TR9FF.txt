In Scotland, the legal system has some key differences from England and Wales, and one of those differences is the size of a jury. While in England and Wales, a jury usually consists of 12 people, in Scotland, a jury has 15 members. This larger jury size is a long-standing tradition within the Scottish legal framework, designed to ensure a broader representation of perspectives when deciding a case. It's interesting to note that Scottish criminal trials also have three verdicts available: guilty, not guilty, and not proven. The "not proven" verdict is unique to Scotland. So, remembering that a Scottish jury has 15 people is crucial for the test, as it highlights one of the distinct features of their legal system.
