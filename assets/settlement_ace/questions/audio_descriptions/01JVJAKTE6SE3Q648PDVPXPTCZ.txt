Bank holidays in the UK are essentially public holidays, days when most businesses and services, including banks, are closed. The term "bank holiday" originated in the 19th century. Before 1871, the Bank of England was closed on about 40 religious feast days and holidays. Sir John Lubbock, a banker and politician, introduced the Bank Holidays Act of 1871, which initially established four bank holidays in England, Wales, and Ireland, and one in Scotland. The idea was to provide days of leisure for the working class. While some bank holidays coincide with religious festivals like Christmas and Easter, the term itself isn't restricted to religious observances. It's a broader category encompassing days designated by law as public holidays. So, while you might be tempted to think of them as religious holidays because some fall on religious days, the key is that they are officially designated public holidays for everyone.
