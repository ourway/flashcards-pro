National Insurance is a fundamental part of the UK's social security system, and it's directly linked to your ability to work legally and access certain benefits. Think of it as your contribution to the pot that funds things like the NHS, unemployment benefits, and the state pension. When you start working in the UK, you're required to register for National Insurance and receive a National Insurance number. This number is unique to you and is used to track your contributions throughout your working life. Employers need this number to deduct National Insurance contributions from your wages. Without a National Insurance number, you might face difficulties in securing employment, as employers are legally obliged to ensure their employees are paying into the system. So, while it's not technically illegal to work without *having* a number immediately, it's a requirement to obtain one to work legally and contribute to the UK's social security system. That's why the statement is true.
