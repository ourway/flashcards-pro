The rule of law is absolutely fundamental to how Britain functions. Think about it: without a consistent and impartial legal system, society would be chaotic. The rule of law means that everyone, including the government, is accountable under the law. This principle has evolved over centuries, with key milestones like the Magna Carta in 1215, which limited the power of the monarch and established the idea that even the king was subject to the law. This contrasts sharply with a system where the upper classes, the monarch, or even individual MPs are above the law. While these entities certainly hold power and influence, they are all ultimately subject to the same legal framework as everyone else. The beauty of the rule of law is that it provides stability, protects individual rights, and ensures that justice is (ideally!) applied fairly to all, regardless of their position in society. It's a cornerstone because it underpins the entire structure of British society and its institutions.
