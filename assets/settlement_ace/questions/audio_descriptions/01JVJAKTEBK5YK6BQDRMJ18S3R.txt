Okay, let's talk about 1066 and the Norman invasion. This is a pivotal moment in British history. Before 1066, England was ruled by Anglo-Saxons. Then, Edward the Confessor died without a clear heir, leading to a succession crisis. Several people laid claim to the throne, including Harold Godwinson, also known as Harold of Wessex. However, William, the Duke of Normandy, believed he was the rightful heir. William crossed the English Channel with his army and met Harold's forces at the Battle of Hastings in October 1066. Harold was killed, and William emerged victorious, becoming King William I, often called William the Conqueror. This Norman conquest dramatically changed England. It brought a new aristocracy, a new language (Norman French, which heavily influenced modern English), and new legal and political systems. So, while Harold of Wessex was a key player in the events of 1066, he was on the losing side. Canute was a Danish king who ruled England much earlier, in the 11th century, and Richard the Lionheart was a much later king, ruling in the 12th century, famous for his role in the Crusades. Therefore, William of Normandy is the correct answer because he was the leader who successfully invaded and conquered England in 1066.
