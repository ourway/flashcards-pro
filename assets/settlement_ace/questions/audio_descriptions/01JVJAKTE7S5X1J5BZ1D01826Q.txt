Okay, let's talk about the rules around drinking alcohol in the UK, because it can be a bit confusing. The general legal drinking age is 18 â€“ that's when you can buy alcohol in a pub, club, or shop. However, there's an exception to this rule. At 16, you *can* drink beer, cider, or wine with a meal in a restaurant or licensed premises. This exception exists because the law recognizes that young people may be introduced to alcohol responsibly within a family setting. It's not about getting drunk; it's about a small amount of alcohol being consumed as part of a meal. So, while you can't just walk into a pub at 16 and order a pint, you *can* have a drink with your Sunday roast. It's worth noting that some people might assume the answer is 18 because that's the general rule, but the question specifically asks about drinking alcohol with a meal, which triggers this specific exception.
