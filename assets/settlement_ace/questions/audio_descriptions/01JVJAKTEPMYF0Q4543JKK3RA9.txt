Bonfire Night, also known as Guy Fawkes Night, is celebrated on November 5th because it commemorates the failure of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605. This plot was a conspiracy by a group of English Catholics, including Guy Fawkes, to assassinate King James I and blow up the Houses of Parliament during the State Opening. The plan was foiled on November 5th when Fawkes was discovered guarding explosives in the cellars beneath Parliament. News of the plot's failure spread quickly, and people lit bonfires in celebration of the King's survival. Over time, this evolved into the annual tradition of Bonfire Night, with effigies of Guy Fawkes traditionally burned on the bonfires. While other dates in November might seem plausible, the 5th is specifically tied to the historical event that the celebration marks, making it the only correct answer.
