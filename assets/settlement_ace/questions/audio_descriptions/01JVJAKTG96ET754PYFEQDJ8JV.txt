The Tower of London, officially Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress, has a long and often grim history intertwined with the English monarchy. Originally built by William the Conqueror in the 11th century, it served as a royal residence, armoury, treasury, and, most famously, a prison and execution site. While many people were imprisoned within its walls, only a select few, usually those of high status, were executed there privately to avoid public spectacle. Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII, was one of these unfortunate individuals. Henry had her tried on charges of treason, incest, and witchcraft, charges likely fabricated to remove her so he could marry again. Because of her royal status as a former Queen, Anne was beheaded within the Tower grounds on 19 May 1536. The other locations listed, such as Pendennis and Peckforton Castle, are castles with their own histories, but they weren't sites of royal executions like the Tower of London, which is why the Tower is the correct answer.
