The Commonwealth is all about countries working together, and at its heart are some really important shared values. Think of it as a club where everyone agrees to play by the same rules. The two biggest rules are the rule of law and democracy. The rule of law means that everyone, even the government, has to follow the law. It's not a case of "might makes right," but rather that laws are applied fairly to everyone. Democracy, of course, is about the people having a say in how they're governed, usually through elections. The Commonwealth promotes free and fair elections and encourages member states to have democratic systems. So, when we talk about the Commonwealth's values, it's these principles of fairness, justice, and the people's voice that really stand out. Other options like communism or violence are completely opposite to what the Commonwealth stands for, as the association promotes peaceful cooperation and democratic governance.
