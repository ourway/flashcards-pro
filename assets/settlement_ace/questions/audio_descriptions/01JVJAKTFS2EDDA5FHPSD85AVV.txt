The Anglo-Saxon period is a crucial foundation for understanding British history. While the Romans withdrew from Britain around 410 AD, marking a power vacuum, the Anglo-Saxon migrations didn't immediately result in established kingdoms. It took time for these Germanic tribes – Angles, Saxons, and Jutes – to settle, conquer territory, and form distinct political entities. The period between 410 AD and 600 AD was one of conflict, gradual settlement, and the slow emergence of these kingdoms. By approximately 600 AD, these kingdoms, such as Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, and Wessex, were relatively firmly established, each with its own king, laws, and customs. This establishment laid the groundwork for later unification and the development of English culture and language. So, while Anglo-Saxon presence was felt earlier, it was around 600 AD that their kingdoms had solidified their control and influence across much of what we now know as England.
