The Wars of the Roses, a series of bloody civil wars fought in England during the 15th century, pitted two powerful families against each other for control of the throne: the House of Lancaster and the House of York. Think of it as a medieval Game of Thrones! The conflict gets its name from the emblems associated with each house: a red rose for Lancaster and a white rose for York. While the fighting was complex and saw periods of Yorkist dominance, ultimately, the Lancastrian claim prevailed. The key turning point came with Henry Tudor, a Lancastrian claimant, defeating Richard III of York at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Henry then married Elizabeth of York, uniting the two houses and establishing the Tudor dynasty. So, while the Yorkists were major players, it was the House of Lancaster, through Henry Tudor, that ultimately emerged victorious and established a new royal line. The Houses of Lords and Commons are parts of Parliament, not royal houses vying for the throne.
