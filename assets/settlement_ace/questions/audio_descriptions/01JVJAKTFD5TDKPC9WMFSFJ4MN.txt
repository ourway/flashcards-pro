Parliament is where laws are debated and created, so it's crucial to have an official record of everything that's said. This record is called Hansard. Think of it like the ultimate set of minutes from every parliamentary session. The name "Hansard" comes from Thomas Curson Hansard, a printer who took over the publication of these parliamentary debates in the early 19th century. While he didn't start the record itself, his name became synonymous with it. Before Hansard, records were often incomplete or unofficial. Now, Hansard provides a detailed account of debates, votes, and other parliamentary proceedings. It's a vital resource for anyone wanting to understand the reasoning behind laws and government policy. The Government report and press are ways the government communicates, but they aren't comprehensive records of everything said in Parliament. As for the Domesday Book, that was a survey of England completed in 1086, commissioned by William the Conqueror â€“ a completely different historical record!
