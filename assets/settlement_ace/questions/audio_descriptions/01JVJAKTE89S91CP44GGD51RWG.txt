Okay, so Charles II's escape from Cromwell's forces after the Battle of Worcester in 1651 is a pretty famous story. After his father, Charles I, was executed, Charles II tried to reclaim the throne, but he was defeated. Now, he was a wanted man, and the Parliamentarians were hot on his trail. He needed to disappear, and fast. He couldn't just stroll into a house or a church â€“ those would be the first places they'd look. Hiding in a garden would offer little protection. The story goes that Charles took refuge in a large oak tree on the grounds of Boscobel House in Shropshire. This wasn't just any tree; it was a particularly large and leafy oak, providing excellent cover. He actually spent a whole day hiding in the tree while soldiers searched the area below. This event is why oak trees are sometimes referred to as "Royal Oaks" and why the image of Charles II in the oak tree became a symbol of the monarchy's resilience. It's a memorable image that highlights the desperate measures he had to take to avoid capture.
