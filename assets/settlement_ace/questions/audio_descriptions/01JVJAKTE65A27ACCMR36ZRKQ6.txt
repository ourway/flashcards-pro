Okay, let's talk about the Act of Union. Think back to the early 18th century. England and Scotland, while sharing a monarch since 1603, were still separate countries with their own parliaments. This created a lot of political and economic tension. Both countries had their own reasons for wanting a closer union. England wanted to secure the Protestant succession and prevent Scotland from allying with its enemies, like France. Scotland, on the other hand, was facing economic hardship and saw union as a way to access England's trade and colonies. After years of negotiations, the Act of Union was passed by both the English and Scottish Parliaments in 1707. This act formally united the two countries into a single Kingdom called Great Britain, dissolving the separate parliaments and creating a new, unified British Parliament. So, when you think of 1707, remember it as the year that England and Scotland officially joined together to form Great Britain through the Act of Union. The other options are incorrect because they either refer to different events or are simply not real historical acts.
