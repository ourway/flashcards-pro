Golf's roots are deeply embedded in Scotland's history, dating back to the 15th century. The game emerged on the eastern coast of Scotland, played on the links land â€“ the sandy area between the sea and farmland. Early forms of golf were quite different from the modern game, but the core idea of hitting a ball into a hole with the fewest strokes was there. In fact, golf became so popular that King James II of Scotland banned it in 1457 because it was distracting young men from archery practice, which was essential for military preparedness! The ban was eventually lifted, and golf continued to evolve in Scotland. The first rules of golf were formalized in 1744 by the Company of Gentlemen Golfers, later known as the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers. So, while other countries have embraced and developed golf, its origin and early development are firmly Scottish, making Scotland the undisputed birthplace of the sport.
