The 18th century is often called the Age of Enlightenment, and for good reason! Think of it as a period where people started questioning traditional ideas and looking for answers based on reason and evidence, rather than just accepting things as they were. Philosophers like John Locke, with his ideas about natural rights, and scientists like Isaac Newton, with his laws of physics, were hugely influential. These new ways of thinking spread through books, pamphlets, and discussions in coffee houses, leading to major changes in politics, philosophy, and science. So, when we talk about new ideas in these areas developing during the 18th century, 'the Enlightenment' is exactly the right term to use. It was a time of intellectual awakening and a real turning point in European history.
