The Union Flag, often called the Union Jack, is a powerful symbol of the United Kingdom, and its design reflects the history of the union. It's a combination of three crosses, not four. The flag brings together the crosses of England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The flag of England features the red cross of St. George, their patron saint. Scotland is represented by the white diagonal cross of St. Andrew. Northern Ireland is represented by the red diagonal cross of St. Patrick. Wales isn't directly represented in the Union Flag because when the first version of the flag was created in 1606, Wales was already united with England. So, while it might seem logical to assume each region has its own cross represented, the Union Flag specifically combines the symbols of England, Scotland, and Ireland. This is a common point of confusion, as many people assume Wales is directly represented, but its history is intertwined with England in the flag's design.
