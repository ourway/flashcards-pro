The Houses of Parliament, officially known as the Palace of Westminster, is instantly recognizable, and its clock tower is one of its most iconic features. Many people mistakenly think the entire tower is called Big Ben, but that's not quite right. The Elizabeth Tower is the name of the tower itself, renamed in 2012 to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee. Inside the tower hangs a massive bell, weighing over 13 tonnes. This bell is the one actually called Big Ben. It was named after Sir Benjamin Hall, who was the Commissioner of Works when the bell was cast in 1858. So, while the London Eye is a famous landmark, and Snowdonia and the Eden Project are beautiful places, they have nothing to do with the Houses of Parliament's bell. Big Ben is the correct answer because it is the actual name of the largest bell housed within the Elizabeth Tower.
