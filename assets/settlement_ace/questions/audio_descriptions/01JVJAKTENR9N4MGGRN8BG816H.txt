Okay, let's talk about the Iron Age and what people were chatting about back then. The Iron Age in Britain roughly spans from 800 BC to the Roman invasion in 43 AD. Now, think about who was living in Britain before the Romans showed up. It was the Celts! These weren't one single tribe, but a collection of different groups who shared similar languages, beliefs, and cultural practices. The languages they spoke belonged to the Celtic language family. So, while we don't know exactly what dialect each group spoke, we know it was a form of Celtic. English, Anglo-Saxon, and Norman French are all much later languages. English, for example, really started to develop after the Anglo-Saxons arrived in the 5th century AD, long after the Iron Age. So, if you're picturing Iron Age Britons, picture them speaking in a language that sounds nothing like modern English, but something from the Celtic family of languages.
