Pressure and lobby groups are all about influencing government policy in a democracy. Think of them as specialized voices trying to get the government to see things their way. They represent various interests, from environmental concerns to specific industries. Their main tool isn't violence or direct action, but persuasion. They campaign, provide research, and meet with politicians to argue for their cause. It's a key part of how different viewpoints get heard in the political process. While assisting MPs or representing businesses might be things some groups *do*, the core function is to actively try and shape the laws and policies that affect them. Violent protests are illegal and counterproductive in a democratic system, and while some groups might offer information to MPs, that's not their primary goal. The correct answer highlights this central role of actively trying to change government policy through campaigning and lobbying.
