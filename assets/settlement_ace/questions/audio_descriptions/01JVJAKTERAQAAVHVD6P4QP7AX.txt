The Enlightenment was a really transformative period in European history, and it's important to understand its timeline. Think of it as a time when people started to prioritize reason, logic, and individual rights over traditional authority. This shift began to take shape in the late 17th century, but it really took off and flourished throughout the 1700s – that's the 18th century. Key Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant were all writing and publishing their influential works during this time. Their ideas about natural rights, separation of powers, and the importance of individual freedom had a profound impact on politics, science, and society. So, while the 19th century saw its own intellectual developments, the core of the Enlightenment – that initial burst of rational thought and its widespread influence – is firmly rooted in the 18th century. It's a common mistake to think of it as stretching into the 19th century, but the initial spark and major developments really happened in the 1700s.
