Okay, let's break down why adult citizens of the UK, Commonwealth citizens, and Irish Republic citizens residing in the UK can indeed vote in all public elections. The right to vote in the UK has evolved over centuries, expanding from a very limited franchise to near-universal suffrage. A key part of this history is the connection with the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 54 independent and equal countries, almost all of which were formerly part of the British Empire. Because of these historical ties and the close relationship between the UK and these nations, Commonwealth citizens residing in the UK are granted voting rights. Similarly, due to the unique historical and geographical relationship between the UK and the Republic of Ireland, Irish citizens living in the UK also enjoy the right to vote. This reciprocal arrangement reflects the close ties and shared history between the two countries. So, the statement is true because the UK extends voting rights to these groups based on historical connections and ongoing relationships.
