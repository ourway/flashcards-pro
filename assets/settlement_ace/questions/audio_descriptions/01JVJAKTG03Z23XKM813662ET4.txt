Okay, let's explore some significant British inventions and discoveries from the 20th century. When we think about cloning a mammal, we're talking about Dolly the sheep, born in 1996 at the Roslin Institute in Scotland. This was a groundbreaking achievement in biology, proving that mammals could be cloned from adult cells. It sparked huge ethical debates, but its scientific impact is undeniable. Now, consider how we access money. Cash machines, or ATMs, were first introduced in London in 1967 by John Shepherd-Barron. The idea came to him after being locked out of his bank after hours. ATMs revolutionized banking, making cash accessible 24/7. Mobile phones were a global effort, with key developments happening in various countries, including the US, but not uniquely British. The Sony Walkman, while popular in the UK, was a Japanese invention. So, while mobile phones and Walkmans have impacted British life, they weren't originally British inventions like cloning and ATMs.
