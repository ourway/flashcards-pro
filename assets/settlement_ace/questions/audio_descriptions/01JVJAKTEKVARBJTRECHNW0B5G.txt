Wimbledon is synonymous with tennis in the UK. The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, founded in 1868, first held a tennis tournament in 1877. This makes Wimbledon the oldest tennis tournament in the world and one of the four Grand Slam tournaments, alongside the Australian Open, the French Open, and the US Open. The tournament is played on grass courts, a surface now relatively rare in professional tennis, adding to its unique character. While cricket and rugby are hugely popular sports in the UK, and there are major tournaments for both, Wimbledon has always been exclusively a tennis event. The image of players dressed in white, the meticulously maintained grass courts, and the tradition of enjoying strawberries and cream all contribute to Wimbledon's distinct identity as a world-renowned tennis championship.
