The Turner Prize is all about celebrating contemporary art in the UK. It was established in 1984 and is named after the famous English painter J.M.W. Turner, known for his dramatic and often abstract landscapes. The prize is awarded annually to a British artist under 50 for an outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work in the previous year. It's a pretty prestigious award and often generates a lot of discussion and debate about what constitutes "art," which is part of its purpose â€“ to promote public interest in contemporary British art. So, while the other options like dancing, garden design, and music are all creative fields, the Turner Prize specifically focuses on visual arts, making "art" the correct answer. It's not about performance or horticulture, but about paintings, sculptures, installations, and other visual mediums.
