Okay, let's break down the UK's system of government. The UK operates under a parliamentary democracy, which means the people elect Members of Parliament (MPs) to represent them and make decisions on their behalf. These elected officials form the government, led by the Prime Minister. Now, here's where it gets interesting: the UK also has a monarch, currently King Charles III, who is the Head of State. This is a system called a constitutional monarchy. The monarch's role is largely symbolic; they don't make political decisions. Instead, they perform ceremonial duties, like opening Parliament and approving legislation. Think of it like this: the elected Parliament runs the country day-to-day, while the monarch represents the nation's history and traditions. So, the statement is true because the UK successfully blends a democratic system with a monarchy, where the elected Parliament holds the real power, and the monarch serves as a figurehead. It's a unique system that has evolved over centuries!
