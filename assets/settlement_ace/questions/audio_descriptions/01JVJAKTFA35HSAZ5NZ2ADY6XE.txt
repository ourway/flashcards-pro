The Council of Europe and the European Union are often confused, but they're actually quite different. The Council of Europe was founded way back in 1949, much earlier than the EU, and its main goal is to uphold human rights, democracy, and the rule of law across Europe. Think of it as a guardian of fundamental freedoms. Now, the European Union, on the other hand, is a political and economic union that evolved from the European Economic Community in the late 20th century. While the EU also cares about human rights, its focus is much broader, encompassing things like trade, economic policy, and free movement of people. The key difference is membership: the Council of Europe has 46 member states, including countries like the UK, Russia, and Turkey, which are not part of the EU. The EU has far fewer members. So, because the Council of Europe has a wider membership and a different primary focus, it's definitely a separate entity from the European Union.
