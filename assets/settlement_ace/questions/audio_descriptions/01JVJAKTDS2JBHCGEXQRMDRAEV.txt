Youth Courts deal with sensitive cases involving young people, so they operate differently from adult courts to protect the children involved. The key principle is to ensure the young person's welfare and rehabilitation are prioritized. This means access is restricted to those directly involved in the case and those with specific training to handle youth matters. Specially trained magistrates are the ones who preside over these courts. They have received additional training to understand the unique challenges and legal considerations involved in dealing with young offenders. While social workers and police officers might be involved in a case, they don't automatically attend the hearings; their presence depends on the specific circumstances. Members of the public are not allowed in Youth Courts to protect the privacy of the young person and avoid any potential stigmatization. So, the specially trained magistrates are the constant presence, ensuring the court operates fairly and effectively for the young person involved.
