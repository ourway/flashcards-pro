The Boer War, a significant event in British imperial history, took place in South Africa between 1899 and 1902. The Boers, also known as Afrikaners, were descendants of Dutch settlers who had established colonies in South Africa from the 17th century onwards. As the British Empire expanded, tensions grew between the British and the Boers over land, resources, and political control. The discovery of gold and diamonds in Boer territories further intensified the conflict. The war was fought in what are now modern-day South Africa, primarily in the Transvaal and Orange Free State regions, which were Boer republics at the time. While France, Russia, and the Netherlands had their own colonial interests and historical connections to Britain, the Boer War was specifically a conflict fought on South African soil against the Boer population.
