Turkey's association with Christmas dinner in the UK is a fascinating story that blends history, economics, and changing tastes. While goose was the traditional festive bird for centuries, turkey gradually gained popularity, particularly from the Victorian era onwards. Several factors contributed to this shift. Firstly, as farming practices improved, turkey became more affordable and accessible to a wider range of the population. Before this, it was seen as a luxury. Secondly, turkey is a larger bird than a chicken, making it ideal for feeding larger families and gatherings, which became increasingly common during Christmas celebrations. By the 20th century, turkey had firmly established itself as the centerpiece of the Christmas feast in the UK. While chicken, beef, or lamb are common meats in British cuisine, they simply don't carry the same historical and cultural weight as turkey when it comes to the traditional Christmas dinner. So, while you might enjoy those meats at other times, turkey is the iconic choice for Christmas.
