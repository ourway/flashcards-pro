The Reform Act of 1832 is a really important milestone in British history, but it's often misunderstood. Think of it as a big step towards a more democratic system, but not a complete overhaul. Its main goal was to address the unfairness of the electoral system at the time. Before 1832, many "rotten boroughs" – areas with very few voters – still had the right to send Members of Parliament to the House of Commons, while new industrial cities like Manchester had no representation at all. The Act redistributed seats to these growing urban areas and broadened the right to vote, but only to a section of the male population. It didn't affect the House of Lords. The House of Lords remained, as it still does today, largely composed of hereditary peers, meaning their titles and right to sit in the House are passed down through their families. While the power of the Lords has been debated and modified over the centuries, the 1832 Reform Act wasn't the legislation that changed their composition. So, the statement is false because the Reform Act focused on the House of Commons and voting rights, not the hereditary nature of the House of Lords.
