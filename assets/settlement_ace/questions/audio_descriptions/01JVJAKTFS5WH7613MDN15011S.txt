Pantomime is a beloved British theatrical tradition, particularly around Christmas time. Its roots actually go way back to the Italian "commedia dell'arte" of the 16th century, which featured stock characters and improvised comedy. Over time, these elements were adapted and incorporated into British theatre. By the 18th and 19th centuries, pantomime had evolved into the form we recognize today: a musical comedy stage production designed for family entertainment. Key features include slapstick humour, cross-dressing (men playing female roles, often "dames"), audience participation (like shouting phrases), and stories loosely based on well-known fairy tales or folk tales. The elaborate costumes, catchy songs, and predictable plot lines all contribute to its festive and lighthearted atmosphere. While tragedy focuses on serious themes and puppetry uses puppets, pantomime is specifically designed to be a fun, interactive, and comedic experience, making it the perfect Christmas entertainment.
