The 1920s were a time of huge technological advancement, and radio was right at the forefront. Think about it: before radio, mass communication was limited to newspapers and word-of-mouth. The British Broadcasting Corporation, or BBC, was formed to take advantage of this new technology. While experimental broadcasts had occurred earlier, the BBC's official, licensed broadcasting began in 1922. This was a pivotal moment because it marked the start of organized, national radio programming in the UK. It's easy to get confused with other dates, but remember that 1928 is too late in the decade, and 1903 is way too early, as it predates much of the early radio technology. 1936 is also incorrect, as this was the year the BBC launched the world's first public television service. So, 1922 is the year to remember for the BBC's groundbreaking entry into radio broadcasting.
