Alright, let's talk about the origins of Scotland and its kings. Before a unified Scotland existed, the area was divided into different kingdoms, including those of the Picts and the Scots. Kenneth MacAlpin, also known as Coinneach mac Ailpein in Gaelic, is widely regarded as the first king to rule over a united Scotland. He achieved this around 843 AD by uniting the Scots and the Picts. This was a crucial moment because it laid the foundation for the Kingdom of Alba, which eventually evolved into modern Scotland. The other options, William I, Harold, and Cnut, are all significant figures in English history, but they were never rulers of Scotland. William I, for example, was the Norman conqueror of England in 1066. So, while those names are important in British history, they have nothing to do with the formation of the Scottish kingdom. Kenneth MacAlpin's unification is the key event that marks the beginning of a single, identifiable Scottish kingdom.
