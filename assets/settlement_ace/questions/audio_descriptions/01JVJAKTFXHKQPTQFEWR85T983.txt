Okay, let's break down electoral registration across the UK. It's true that everyone eligible to vote needs to register, but the *way* they register differs slightly depending on where they live. England, Wales, and Scotland use a system where individuals register themselves. This means each person is responsible for completing their own registration form with their personal details. However, the hint points to Northern Ireland, where a different system is in place. In Northern Ireland, individual electoral registration is required, meaning you need to provide additional proof of identity, like your National Insurance number and date of birth, when you register. This system was introduced to address concerns about electoral fraud and ensure the accuracy of the electoral register. So, while the statement might seem generally true because everyone *does* need to register to vote, the specific requirement of "individual electoral registration" with extra identity verification is unique to Northern Ireland, making the statement false for England, Wales, and Scotland.
