The Troubles, a period of intense conflict in Northern Ireland, stemmed from deep-seated disagreements about the very identity and future of the region. At its core was the question of whether Northern Ireland should remain part of the United Kingdom or become part of a united Ireland. This wasn't simply a political squabble; it was rooted in centuries of history, religious differences (primarily between Catholics and Protestants), and national identity. Unionists/loyalists, mainly Protestants, wanted to maintain the union with the UK, while nationalists/republicans, predominantly Catholics, sought a unified Ireland. The conflict, which lasted roughly from the late 1960s to the late 1990s, involved paramilitary groups on both sides, as well as the British Army. While issues like civil rights and discrimination certainly fueled the conflict, the fundamental disagreement over sovereignty – whether Ireland should be one country – was the underlying issue that sparked and sustained the violence. Independence for Wales and Scotland were not factors in this conflict, and the English Parliament already existed.
