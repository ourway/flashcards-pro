After the Second World War ended in 1945, Britain held a general election. Although Winston Churchill had led the country through the war, the public voted for change. Clement Attlee, leader of the Labour Party, became Prime Minister. Attlee's government is significant because it established the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, providing free healthcare to all. His government also nationalized key industries like coal, railways, and electricity, aiming to rebuild the country and create a fairer society. While Churchill was a prominent figure, his wartime leadership ended in 1945, and he didn't return to power until 1951. R.A. Butler was a prominent Conservative politician but never served as Prime Minister. Dylan Thomas, the famous poet, had nothing to do with politics. Therefore, Clement Attlee is the correct answer because he was the Prime Minister who oversaw the significant post-war reforms in Britain from 1945 to 1951.
