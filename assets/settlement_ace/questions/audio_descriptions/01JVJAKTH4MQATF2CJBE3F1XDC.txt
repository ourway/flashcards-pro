The 1960s in Britain, often called the 'Swinging Sixties', was a period of significant social and cultural change. After years of post-war austerity, there was a newfound sense of optimism and a desire to challenge traditional norms. This era saw major shifts in attitudes towards personal freedom and individual rights. One of the key areas of reform was family law. The Divorce Reform Act of 1969, which came into effect in 1971, made it easier for couples to divorce, moving away from the need to prove fault. Before this, divorce was difficult and stigmatized. Similarly, the Abortion Act of 1967 legalized abortion on certain grounds, giving women more control over their reproductive health. These two reforms – divorce law reform and abortion law reform – are strongly associated with the 'Swinging Sixties' because they reflect the decade's broader push for greater personal autonomy and a more liberal society. While children's rights are important, major reforms came later. Decimal currency was introduced in 1971, just outside the core 'Swinging Sixties' period, and was more of an economic and practical change than a social one.
