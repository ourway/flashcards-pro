Okay, let's talk about when Britain first started using coins. The key here is understanding the timeline of British history and the materials associated with each age. The Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Gold Age all predate the technology needed for coin production. Coinage requires a certain level of metalworking skill. The Iron Age, which began around 800 BC, marked a significant advancement in metalworking. Iron tools and weapons became common, and this period also saw the development of more sophisticated techniques for working with other metals. It was during this time that the first coins were minted in Britain. These early coins were often made of bronze, silver, or gold, but the Iron Age provided the technological foundation for their creation. So, while you might think of gold being used for coins, the *ability* to make them came with the Iron Age.
