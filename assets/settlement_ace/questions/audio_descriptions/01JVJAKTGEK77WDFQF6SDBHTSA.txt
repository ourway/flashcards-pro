Okay, let's unravel the structure of the Scottish Parliament. While the Magna Carta, signed in 1215, significantly shaped English law and governance, its direct impact on the Scottish Parliament's structure is a common misconception. The Scottish Parliament, unlike the English Parliament which evolved into two houses (Lords and Commons), historically operated with *three* Estates. These were the Lords (nobility), the Commons (burgh representatives), and the Clergy (church officials). This three-estate system was a key feature of the Scottish Parliament from the 15th century until its dissolution in 1707 with the Acts of Union. So, the statement that the Scottish Parliament was split into just two estates after the Magna Carta is incorrect because it always had three, and the Magna Carta was an English document that did not directly change the Scottish Parliament's structure. It's easy to get confused because the English system is more widely known, but remember Scotland's unique three-estate setup!
