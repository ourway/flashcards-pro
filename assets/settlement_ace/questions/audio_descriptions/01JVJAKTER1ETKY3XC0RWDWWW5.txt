Volunteering is deeply rooted in the British spirit of community and civic duty. Throughout history, people have come together to support each other, especially during times of crisis. Think about the volunteer ambulance drivers during World War I or the countless individuals who dedicate their time to local charities today. The core reason people volunteer isn't for personal enrichment or recognition, although those can be nice side effects. It's fundamentally driven by a genuine desire to make a positive impact on the lives of others. It's about empathy and wanting to contribute to the well-being of society. While some might volunteer to gain experience or boost their CV, the primary and underlying motivation, according to surveys and studies on volunteerism, is altruism â€“ the selfless concern for the welfare of others. It's this intrinsic motivation that sustains long-term volunteering efforts and builds stronger, more connected communities.
