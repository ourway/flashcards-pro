The World Wide Web, which transformed how we access and share information, was born at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in 1989. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist working there, is credited with its invention. He realized the potential of linking documents together using hypertext on the internet, creating a user-friendly way to navigate the vast amount of information available. He developed the key components like HTML, HTTP, and URLs that make the web work. While the internet itself had existed for some time, it was Berners-Lee's vision and technical skills that made it accessible and popular for everyday use. Peter Mansfield was a physicist known for his work in MRI, Wilfred Owen was a famous war poet, and Clement Attlee was a post-war Prime Minister. While all important figures, none of them were involved in the creation of the World Wide Web.
