Okay, let's talk football! When we think about the structure of football, it's helpful to understand there are different levels of organization. At the top, you have international bodies that govern the sport across Europe and even the world. UEFA, which stands for the Union of European Football Associations, is the administrative body for football, futsal and beach soccer in Europe. They organize major competitions like the Champions League and the Europa League. Then, within countries, you have national leagues. In England, the Premier League is the top professional league for football clubs. It's where you'll find famous teams like Manchester United and Liverpool competing. So, UEFA is the European governing body, and the Premier League is the top English league. The other options relate to different sports entirely. The Ashes is a famous cricket test series between England and Australia, steeped in history and tradition. The Open, often referred to as the British Open, is one of the major golf championships.
