Haggis is deeply intertwined with Scottish culture and cuisine. It's a savory pudding containing sheep's pluck – that's the heart, liver, and lungs – minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and stock, traditionally encased in the animal's stomach. While it might sound unusual to some, it's considered a national dish of Scotland. Its origins are somewhat murky, but it's been associated with Scotland for centuries, with written recipes appearing as early as the 15th century. The famous Scottish poet Robert Burns even wrote a poem, "Address to a Haggis," solidifying its place in Scottish identity. So, while roast beef is more associated with England, Ulster fry with Northern Ireland, and fish and chips are a British staple, haggis is the food most traditionally and distinctly linked to Scotland.
