During the reign of Elizabeth I, which spanned from 1558 to 1603, England began seriously exploring and laying claim to territories across the Atlantic. This was a period of intense maritime exploration and competition with other European powers like Spain and Portugal. While England had dabbled in exploration before, Elizabeth I's reign marked a turning point toward establishing permanent settlements. Think about figures like Sir Walter Raleigh, who attempted to establish colonies in North America, most famously Roanoke, though that initial attempt failed. The idea was to gain resources, expand trade, and project English power. So, while England was involved in trade with Africa and had diplomatic relations with European countries, the focus of colonization efforts during Elizabeth I's time was firmly on America, specifically the eastern coast of what is now the United States.
