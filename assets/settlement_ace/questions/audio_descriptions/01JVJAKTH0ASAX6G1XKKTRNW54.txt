Saint George is the Patron Saint of England, and his story is deeply interwoven with English identity. Although he wasn't English himself – he was likely a Roman soldier from the 3rd century – the legend of Saint George slaying a dragon became incredibly popular in Europe during the Middle Ages. The dragon, of course, symbolizes evil, and George's victory represents good triumphing over evil. His association with England really took off in the 14th century when King Edward III made him the patron saint of the Order of the Garter, a prestigious order of chivalry. Since then, his image, particularly the red cross on a white background (Saint George's Cross), has become a powerful symbol of England, appearing on the English flag and representing the nation in various contexts, from sports to national celebrations. While St. Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland, St. David is the patron saint of Wales, and St. Andrew is the patron saint of Scotland, it's St. George who holds this special place for England.
