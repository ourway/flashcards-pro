The Proms, short for the BBC Proms, are a cornerstone of British cultural life, particularly in London. Imagine a massive, joyful celebration of classical music that takes over the city every summer. That's essentially what The Proms are. The event is officially called the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts presented by the BBC. The series of concerts was founded in 1895, and has been held every year since, except during World War II. The Proms aren't just a single concert; it's an eight-week-long festival, usually from July to September, dedicated to orchestral music and other classical forms. The name "Proms" comes from the original idea that people could promenade, or walk around, while listening to the music. While there are seated tickets, a key feature is the "promenading" area, especially in the Royal Albert Hall, where you can stand and enjoy the music at a much cheaper price. This makes classical music accessible to everyone, not just the elite. So, when you think of The Proms, think of a long summer season filled with beautiful orchestral sounds.
