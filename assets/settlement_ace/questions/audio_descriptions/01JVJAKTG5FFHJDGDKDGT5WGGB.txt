The NSPCC, or the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, is the UK's leading children's charity. It was founded in 1884, driven by a Victorian social reformer named Benjamin Waugh, who was deeply concerned about the abuse and neglect of children. Before the NSPCC, there was no specific organisation dedicated to protecting children's rights. The charity played a crucial role in shaping legislation to safeguard children and continues to do so today. They operate helplines like Childline, which provides a safe space for young people to talk about their problems. So, when you see a question about charities that focus on children, the NSPCC is the one to remember because their entire mission is centered around the well-being and protection of children. The other charities have different focuses: The National Trust protects historical places and natural landscapes, Crisis and Shelter work to combat homelessness, and the PDSA provides veterinary care for animals.
