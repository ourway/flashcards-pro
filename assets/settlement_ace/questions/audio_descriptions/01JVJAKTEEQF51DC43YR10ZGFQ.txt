Okay, here's an explanation of why MPs aren't just confined to the House of Commons. Think of MPs as representatives of their local area, their constituency. They're elected to represent the people who live there, so it's really important that they're accessible to them. While they do spend time in Parliament debating laws and representing their constituents' interests on a national level, a big part of their job is also being available locally. They hold surgeries, which are like drop-in sessions where constituents can meet them face-to-face to discuss concerns. These surgeries are usually held in local community centres, libraries, or even the MP's constituency office. So, while the House of Commons is certainly a key place where they work, it's definitely not the only place you can approach them. They need to be visible and available in their local area to properly do their job. It's all about being accountable and responsive to the people who elected them.
