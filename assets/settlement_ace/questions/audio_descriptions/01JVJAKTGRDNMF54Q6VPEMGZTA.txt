Okay, let's break down why the American colonies sought independence from Britain. Think back to the 18th century. Britain had fought costly wars, like the French and Indian War, and needed to replenish its treasury. They looked to their American colonies as a source of revenue. The British government began imposing a series of taxes on the colonists, such as the Stamp Act and the Tea Act. The colonists felt this was unfair because they had no representation in the British Parliament, which was making these decisions. This led to the famous cry of "No taxation without representation!" The colonists believed they shouldn't be taxed if they didn't have elected officials representing their interests in the British government. While border control, resources, and jobs were concerns, the main catalyst for the American Revolution was this resentment over taxation without representation. It's a key principle of democracy, and the colonists felt their rights were being violated.
