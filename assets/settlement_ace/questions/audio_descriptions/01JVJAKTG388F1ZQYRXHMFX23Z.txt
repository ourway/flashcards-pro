The Highland Clearances were a tragic period in Scottish history, mainly during the 18th and 19th centuries. Landlords forcibly evicted tenants from their ancestral lands in the Scottish Highlands. The primary reason wasn't a slave rebellion, but rather economic factors. Landowners found that raising sheep was more profitable than having tenant farmers. Sheep farming required fewer people, so the landowners cleared the land to make way for large flocks. This resulted in widespread displacement and emigration. Many Highlanders were forced to move to the Scottish Lowlands, other parts of Britain, or overseas to countries like Canada and Australia. While there were instances of resistance to the clearances, it wasn't a slave rebellion. The clearances were driven by landlords seeking to maximize profits from their land, leading to the forced removal of the Highland population. So, the statement is false because the Highland Clearances were about land use and profit, not a response to a slave uprising.
