Okay, let's talk about the American colonies declaring independence. Back in the 18th century, Great Britain had a bunch of colonies all over the world, including thirteen in North America. These colonies had been growing and developing for quite some time, but tensions started rising with the British government over issues like taxation and representation. The colonists felt they were being unfairly treated and didn't have a say in the laws that affected them. This frustration eventually led to the American Revolutionary War, which began in 1775. Then, in 1776, representatives from these thirteen colonies came together and formally declared their independence from Great Britain. This was a huge turning point in history, marking the birth of the United States of America. So, when we talk about colonial territories announcing independence in 1776, it's specifically the American colonies we're referring to. Australia, Canada, and South Africa gained independence much later, in the 20th century, through different processes.
