World War One, often called the Great War, was a global conflict that had a profound impact on Britain and the world. It began in 1914, triggered by a complex web of alliances and the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. For over four years, countries across Europe, and beyond, were locked in a brutal struggle characterized by trench warfare and devastating new technologies. Britain played a significant role, mobilizing its empire and suffering heavy losses. After years of intense fighting, the war finally came to an end in 1918. Specifically, the armistice, or agreement to stop fighting, was signed on November 11th, 1918. This date is still commemorated every year as Remembrance Day. While fighting continued in some areas into 1919, the major hostilities ceased in November 1918, making it the year the war concluded. The Treaty of Versailles, formally ending the war, wasn't signed until 1919, which is why that year might be a tempting but incorrect answer.
