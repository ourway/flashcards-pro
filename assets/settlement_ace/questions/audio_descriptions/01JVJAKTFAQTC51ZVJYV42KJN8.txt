The Speaker of the House of Commons is a crucial role, acting as an impartial chair during debates and ensuring Parliament runs smoothly. To maintain this impartiality, the Speaker isn't chosen by the government or a party leader. Instead, after a general election or when a Speaker retires, MPs vote in a secret ballot to elect someone from among themselves. This secret ballot is really important because it allows MPs to vote freely, without pressure from their party. It ensures the Speaker is someone respected across the House and seen as fair by everyone, not just someone favored by the ruling party. The first Speaker was Sir Thomas Hungerford in 1377. So, the process has been in place for a long time. While it might seem like party lines would influence the vote, the tradition is that the Speaker steps away from party politics once elected, and the secret ballot helps reinforce that independence.
