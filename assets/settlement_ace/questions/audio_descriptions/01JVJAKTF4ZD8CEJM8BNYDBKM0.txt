Geoffrey Chaucer, often called the "father of English literature," lived in the 14th century, a time of great social and political change. He wrote in Middle English, which can be tricky for modern readers, but his stories are timeless. The key to remembering Chaucer is associating him with *The Canterbury Tales*. This isn't just any collection of stories; it's a frame narrative, meaning there's a larger story holding all the individual tales together. In this case, a group of pilgrims are travelling together from London to Canterbury Cathedral to visit the shrine of Thomas Becket, a famous Archbishop. To pass the time on their journey, each pilgrim tells a story. That's why it's called *The Canterbury Tales*! It offers a fantastic snapshot of medieval English society, with characters from all walks of life â€“ knights, millers, nuns, and more. The other options, like "The London Tales," are designed to mislead you because Chaucer lived and worked in London, but his most famous work is specifically linked to the pilgrimage to Canterbury.
