The 19th century saw massive changes in transport, and the Stephensons were right at the heart of it. Before railways, canals were the main way to move heavy goods, but they were slow and limited by geography. Then came steam power! George Stephenson, often called the "Father of Railways," designed and built early steam locomotives. His son, Robert, joined him, and together they improved the designs. Their most famous engine, "The Rocket," won the Rainhill Trials in 1829, proving that railways could be a fast and efficient way to transport people and goods. This victory really kicked off the railway boom in Britain. So, while canals were important and automobiles came later, the Stephensons specifically revolutionized railway engines and the entire railway system. Agricultural machinery is a completely different field, so that's not right either. Think of those iconic steam trains â€“ that's the Stephensons' legacy!
