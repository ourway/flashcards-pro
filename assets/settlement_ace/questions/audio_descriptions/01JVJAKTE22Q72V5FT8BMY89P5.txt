Big Ben, officially known as the Elizabeth Tower, is one of London's most iconic landmarks, but it hasn't been around quite as long as some might think. Construction on the tower began in 1843 as part of Charles Barry's design for the new Palace of Westminster after the old palace was largely destroyed by fire. The clock itself started keeping time on May 31, 1859, and the first chimes rang out on July 11 of the same year. So, if we do the math, that makes Big Ben roughly 150 years old. While 170, 200, or even 220 years might seem plausible given London's rich history, those numbers overestimate Big Ben's actual age. It's a relatively "young" landmark compared to other historical sites in the UK, but its presence has certainly been a constant in London life for a century and a half.
