Okay, let's delve into the history behind the Book of Common Prayer. To understand this, we need to remember the religious upheaval that occurred in England during the Tudor period. Henry VIII, initially a devout Catholic, broke with the Pope in the 1530s to establish the Church of England, primarily so he could divorce Catherine of Aragon. However, Henry's religious reforms were somewhat limited. It was during the reign of his son, Edward VI, that the Church of England became more firmly Protestant. Edward VI, a young king with powerful Protestant advisors, pushed for more radical religious changes. A key part of this was the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer in 1549. This book provided a standard form of worship in English, replacing the Latin services previously used. It was a significant step in establishing a distinct Protestant identity for the Church of England. Therefore, the Book of Common Prayer was drafted and mandated for use during Edward VI's reign, solidifying his place in religious history. While Henry VIII initiated the English Reformation, it was Edward VI who truly shaped the Church of England's Protestant character.
