Okay, let's talk about when the UK finally achieved full democracy in its voting system. It's easy to think that universal suffrage happened all at once, but it was a gradual process. The Reform Act of 1832 was a start, but it only extended the vote to some middle-class men. Significant changes happened in 1918, right after World War I, when the Representation of the People Act granted the vote to men over 21 and some women over 30. This was a big step, acknowledging the contributions of women during the war effort. However, it wasn't *full* democracy. The key year is 1928. In this year, another Representation of the People Act was passed, granting all men and women over the age of 21 the right to vote, regardless of property ownership or other restrictions. This is the point where the UK can truly be said to have a fully democratic voting system. So, while 1918 was important, it was 1928 that completed the journey to universal adult suffrage.
