The Black Death, a devastating plague in the mid-14th century, drastically reshaped English society. It wiped out a huge portion of the population, leading to a labor shortage. This shortage empowered the surviving peasants and workers. They could demand higher wages and better working conditions from landowners who desperately needed their labor. This newfound economic power allowed many to accumulate wealth and move away from traditional feudal obligations. People migrated to towns and cities seeking opportunities, leading to a growth in trade and commerce. This created a new class of merchants, artisans, and skilled workers who were neither nobles nor peasants. This group, the middle class, became increasingly important in English society, challenging the traditional social hierarchy and laying the groundwork for future economic and political changes. While a youthful workforce might seem plausible, the plague actually reduced the workforce overall. Powerful clans and slavery were not direct results of the Black Death's societal changes.
