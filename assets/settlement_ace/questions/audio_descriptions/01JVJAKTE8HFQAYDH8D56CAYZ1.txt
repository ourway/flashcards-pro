St. Helena, that remote volcanic island in the South Atlantic, has a fascinating history, most famously known as the place of Napoleon Bonaparte's final exile and death in 1821. But its current status is what's important here. It's not a Crown Dependency like the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands. Those dependencies have their own governments and laws, even though the British monarch is their head of state. Instead, St. Helena is a British Overseas Territory. This means it's under the sovereignty of the UK, but it has its own constitution and a degree of self-government. The UK government is responsible for its external affairs, defence, and internal security. So, while it's connected to the UK, it's not directly ruled by the Crown in the same way a Crown Dependency is. Think of it as a distant outpost, with the UK providing support and oversight, rather than a self-governing entity under the Crown.
