Pressure and lobby groups are all about influencing government policy. Think of them as organized groups of people who share a common goal and actively try to persuade the government to adopt policies that support that goal. This influence can take many forms, from directly meeting with politicians and civil servants to running public awareness campaigns and organizing protests. They're a key part of the democratic process, giving different voices and interests a chance to be heard.

Now, let's look at why the other options are incorrect. The Chartists were a 19th-century working-class movement campaigning for political reforms, like the right to vote for all men. While they did try to influence the government, their focus was on broader political change rather than specific policies. The Quakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, are a religious group known for their pacifism and social justice work. While they advocate for certain values, they aren't primarily focused on directly influencing government policy. The Cabinet is a group of senior government ministers selected by the Prime Minister to lead government departments and set the government's agenda. They *make* government policy, not influence it from the outside. So, the only option that directly aligns with the aim of influencing government policy is pressure and lobby groups.
