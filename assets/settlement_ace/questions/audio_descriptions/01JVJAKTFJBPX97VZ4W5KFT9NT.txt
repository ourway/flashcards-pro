The Iron Age in Britain, lasting roughly from 800 BC to the Roman invasion in 43 AD, was a period of significant cultural and technological development. People during this time were skilled metalworkers, hence the name 'Iron Age,' and they used iron to create tools, weapons, and, importantly, the first coins. These early coins weren't like the standardized currency we use today. They were often made of bronze, silver, or gold and were likely used for trade and status display. The Anglo-Saxons, who arrived much later, after the Roman period, had their own coinage systems, but they weren't the first. The Romans also had their own coins, of course, but they came to Britain after the Iron Age people had already started minting their own. The Stone Age was far too early; people back then didn't have the metalworking technology needed for coin production. So, the Iron Age people were the pioneers of coinage in Britain.
