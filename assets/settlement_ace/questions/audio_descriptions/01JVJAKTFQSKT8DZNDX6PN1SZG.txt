Hansard is essentially the official, word-for-word record of what's said in Parliament. Think of it as the minutes of a very important meeting, but instead of just summarizing the key points, it captures everything thatâ€™s spoken in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. This includes debates, questions to ministers, and even voting records. The name "Hansard" comes from Thomas Curson Hansard, a printer who took over the publication of these parliamentary debates in the early 19th century. Making Hansard available online is a key part of ensuring transparency and accountability in the UK government. It allows anyone to see what their elected representatives are saying and doing in Parliament. This commitment to open access means that everything recorded in Hansard, from the most significant debates to the smallest procedural points, is indeed available online for public scrutiny.
