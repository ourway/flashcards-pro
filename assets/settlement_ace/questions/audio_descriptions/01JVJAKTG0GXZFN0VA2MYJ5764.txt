St. Helena's status can be a bit confusing, so let's clarify. Crown Dependencies, like the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands, are self-governing possessions of the Crown. They aren't technically part of the UK, but the UK government is responsible for their defense and international relations. St. Helena, on the other hand, is a British Overseas Territory. These territories, like the Falkland Islands or Gibraltar, were mostly remnants of the British Empire. While they have varying degrees of self-governance, the UK retains more direct control than it does with Crown Dependencies. St. Helena relies on the UK for financial support and defense. So, while it might seem like a technicality, the key difference lies in the level of autonomy and the historical relationship with the UK. Thinking it's a Crown Dependency is understandable because both have ties to the UK, but St. Helena's history as a colony makes it a British Overseas Territory.
