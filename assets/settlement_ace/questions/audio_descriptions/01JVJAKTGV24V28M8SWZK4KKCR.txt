Charles Dickens is one of Britain's most celebrated Victorian novelists, known for his vivid characters and social commentary. He wrote extensively about the lives of the poor and the injustices of Victorian society. "Great Expectations," published in 1861, follows the story of Pip, an orphan who comes into wealth and learns about the true meaning of success. "Oliver Twist," published in 1838, tells the tale of an orphan who escapes a workhouse and becomes entangled with a gang of pickpockets in London. Both novels are quintessential Dickens, exploring themes of poverty, class, and morality. While "Harry Potter" is a beloved series, it was written by J.K. Rowling in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, centuries after Dickens. "Pride and Prejudice" is a classic, but it was penned by Jane Austen, a contemporary of Dickens but with a very different style and focus, primarily on the lives and loves of the English gentry.
