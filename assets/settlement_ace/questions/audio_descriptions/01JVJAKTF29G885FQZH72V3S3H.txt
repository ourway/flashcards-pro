County Courts are the backbone of the civil justice system in the UK, dealing with a huge range of disputes between individuals or organizations. Think of them as the everyday courts for resolving disagreements. Unlike Youth Courts, which specifically handle cases involving young people, or the non-existent "Peace Courts," County Courts have a very broad jurisdiction. They handle things like debt claims, landlord and tenant disputes, personal injury claims, and contract disagreements. Because these courts are so versatile, they are the place where most civil disputes are initially heard. They are designed to be accessible to the public, making them the go-to option for resolving a wide variety of legal issues without needing to go to a higher, more specialized court.
