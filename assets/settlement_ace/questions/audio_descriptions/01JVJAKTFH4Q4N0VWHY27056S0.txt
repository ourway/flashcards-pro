Saint Patrick's Day, celebrated on March 17th, is a globally recognised cultural and religious holiday. It commemorates the death of Saint Patrick, the foremost patron saint of Ireland. Now, while the UK has several patron saints – St. George for England, St. Andrew for Scotland, and St. David for Wales – St. Patrick is specifically associated with Ireland. He lived in the 5th century and is credited with bringing Christianity to Ireland. The day is traditionally marked by wearing green, displaying shamrocks (a national symbol of Ireland), attending parades, and enjoying Irish music and dance. Because St. David's Day is on March 1st, St. Andrew's Day is on November 30th, and St. George's Day is on April 23rd, the only possible answer is St. Patrick, whose feast day is firmly fixed on March 17th.
