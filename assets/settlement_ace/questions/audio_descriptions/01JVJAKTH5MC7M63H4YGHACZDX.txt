An expanding, ageing population is a demographic trend seen in many developed countries, including the UK. To understand why better healthcare and living standards are the key drivers, think about what influences how long people live and how many children they have. Improved healthcare means people are less likely to die from diseases and illnesses that were once fatal. Advances in medicine, vaccinations, and access to medical care all contribute to longer lifespans. Similarly, better living standards – things like access to nutritious food, safe housing, and clean water – also play a huge role in improving overall health and longevity. People are simply living longer, healthier lives. While improved education is undoubtedly a positive thing for society, it doesn't directly cause an ageing population. Cheaper food, while beneficial, doesn't have the same significant impact on life expectancy as comprehensive healthcare and improved living conditions. It's the combination of these factors that leads to a larger proportion of older people in the population.
