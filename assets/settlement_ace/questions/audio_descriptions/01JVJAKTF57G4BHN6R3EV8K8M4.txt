William Shakespeare, arguably the most famous writer in the English language, lived from 1564 to 1616, during the Elizabethan era. He wrote around 39 plays, spanning comedies, tragedies, and histories. "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is a comedy, known for its magical fairies, tangled love stories, and playful humor, making it a staple of summer theatre productions. "Romeo and Juliet," on the other hand, is a tragic love story set in Verona, Italy, about two young lovers from feuding families. Its themes of love, fate, and conflict have resonated with audiences for centuries. Now, while "Oliver Twist" is a classic novel, it was written by Charles Dickens in the 19th century, much later than Shakespeare's time. Similarly, "Pride and Prejudice" is a beloved novel, but it was penned by Jane Austen, also in the 19th century. Therefore, the only two options that fit the bill as plays written by Shakespeare are "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Romeo and Juliet."
