Okay, let's talk about UK sports stars! When we think about famous figures in the UK, it's easy to get caught up in actors, writers, or artists, but sports play a huge role in British culture. Sir Chris Hoy is a Scottish track cyclist who is one of Britain's most successful Olympians. He has won six gold medals and one silver, making him a household name. He was even knighted for his services to sport, hence the "Sir" in his name. Dame Kelly Holmes is another iconic British athlete. She is a middle-distance runner who achieved incredible success at the 2004 Athens Olympics, winning gold medals in both the 800 metres and 1500 metres. Her achievements led to her being made a Dame, the female equivalent of a knighthood. So, when you're asked about well-known sports stars, remembering these two champions is a great way to go. Lucien Freud was a famous painter and Jane Austen a celebrated novelist, but neither are known for their sporting achievements.
