During World War II, Britain faced a sustained aerial assault from Nazi Germany. This intense bombing campaign, primarily targeting London and other major British cities, became known as the Blitz, derived from the German word "Blitzkrieg," meaning "lightning war." The Blitz began in September 1940 and continued, with varying intensity, until May 1941. The aim was to demoralize the British public and cripple the country's war effort by destroying infrastructure and factories. While the UK did eventually bomb German cities, this was a separate and later part of the war effort. The Blitz specifically refers to the period when Britain was under intense aerial bombardment by Germany. The evacuation from Dunkirk was a separate event where British and allied troops were rescued from France. So, the Blitz is the correct answer because it specifically describes the German bombing campaign against British cities during that period.
