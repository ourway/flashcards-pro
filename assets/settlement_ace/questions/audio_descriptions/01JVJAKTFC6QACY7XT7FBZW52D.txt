Mary, Queen of Scots, was a fascinating and tragic figure in British history. She was Elizabeth I's cousin, and as a Catholic with a claim to the English throne, she was a constant source of worry for Elizabeth. England had officially broken with the Catholic Church, and many Catholics felt Mary was the rightful Queen. Mary was eventually implicated in plots to overthrow Elizabeth, particularly the Babington Plot in 1586, which aimed to assassinate Elizabeth and place Mary on the throne. While Mary denied direct involvement, her correspondence suggested otherwise. Because of this perceived threat to the English monarchy and the stability of the country, Elizabeth reluctantly signed Mary's death warrant. Mary was beheaded in 1587 at Fotheringhay Castle. So, while the other options might seem plausible for someone of that era, Mary's story is unique because her ambition and the political climate of the time led directly to her execution.
