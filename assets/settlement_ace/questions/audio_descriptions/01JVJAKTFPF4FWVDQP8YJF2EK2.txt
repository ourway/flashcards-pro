Life peers are members of the House of Lords who are appointed for their lifetime, and their titles aren't hereditary. This system allows the Lords to benefit from the experience of people who've made significant contributions to society. So, who decides who gets this honor? Well, the power to nominate these individuals rests primarily with the leaders of the main political parties and, most importantly, the Prime Minister. The PM routinely recommends individuals for peerages, often recognizing long-standing service or expertise. While the monarch formally appoints life peers, they do so on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Speaker of the House doesn't have this power, as their role is to maintain order and preside over debates in the House of Commons. While the Monarchy is involved in the final approval, they act on the recommendations of the Prime Minister, so the real power of nomination lies with the political leadership.
