Ulster Fry is a traditional dish, but it's definitely not Welsh! It's a staple breakfast food in Northern Ireland. Think of it as Northern Ireland's answer to the full English breakfast. It typically includes fried bacon, sausages, eggs, black pudding, white pudding, tomatoes, and soda bread, all fried together. The key element that really makes it "Ulster" is the inclusion of both soda bread and potato bread, often fried in the same pan as the other ingredients. Wales, on the other hand, has its own distinct culinary traditions. While they also enjoy a good breakfast, you're more likely to find laverbread (a seaweed dish), Welsh cakes, or bara brith (a fruit loaf) on a Welsh breakfast table. So, while both Wales and Northern Ireland have rich food cultures, Ulster Fry is firmly rooted in Northern Irish tradition, making the statement that it's Welsh completely inaccurate.
