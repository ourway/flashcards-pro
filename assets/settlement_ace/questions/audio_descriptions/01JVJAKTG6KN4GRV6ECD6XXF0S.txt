Okay, let's talk about why the Queen delivers that important speech outlining the government's plans. This tradition is deeply rooted in British history and the way the UK government is structured. Think of the UK as having three main parts: the Monarch (currently the King, but historically the Queen), the House of Lords, and the House of Commons. Parliament is made up of all three. The speech, formally known as the "Queen's Speech" (or King's Speech now), happens at the State Opening of Parliament, which marks the beginning of the parliamentary year. The government, led by the Prime Minister, writes the speech. It details what laws and policies they intend to introduce over the coming months. The Queen, as Head of State, delivers this speech in the House of Lords. She's not actually deciding the policies herself; she's acting as a symbol of the state, reading out the government's agenda. So, while the Prime Minister and Cabinet are responsible for *creating* the policies, it's the Monarch who *presents* them to Parliament and the nation. This tradition highlights the UK's constitutional monarchy, where the monarch reigns but doesn't rule.
