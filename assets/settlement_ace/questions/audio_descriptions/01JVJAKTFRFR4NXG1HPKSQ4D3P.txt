The Brit Awards are all about celebrating the best in British and international music. Think of it as the UK's equivalent to the Grammy Awards in the United States. The awards ceremony started in 1977, originally under a different name, but became the "Brit Awards" in 1989. "Brit" is short for "British," so that should give you a clue! The awards cover a wide range of musical genres and achievements, from pop and rock to classical and dance music. They recognize outstanding contributions to the music industry. While the UK certainly has a thriving theatre scene with the Olivier Awards, and a strong film industry celebrated by the BAFTAs, the Brits are specifically dedicated to music. Similarly, while art is valued, it's not the focus of this particular awards show. So, if you hear "Brit Awards," immediately think of music and the talented artists who create it.
