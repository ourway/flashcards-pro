Criminal law deals with actions that are considered harmful to society as a whole, not just to an individual. Think of it as the government stepping in to protect everyone. Selling tobacco to someone under 18 is a criminal offense because it violates laws designed to protect young people's health. Similarly, racial crimes, which are motivated by prejudice and target individuals based on their race or ethnicity, are considered criminal acts because they undermine social harmony and equality. These actions are seen as a direct threat to the well-being of the community, and that's why they fall under criminal law. On the other hand, things like workplace discrimination or disputes over faulty goods are generally handled through civil law. Civil law focuses on resolving disagreements between individuals or organizations, often involving compensation or other remedies, but not necessarily involving the state prosecuting someone for a crime against society.
