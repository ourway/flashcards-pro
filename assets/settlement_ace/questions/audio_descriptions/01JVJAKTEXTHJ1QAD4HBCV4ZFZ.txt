Okay, let's break down why "Independents" is the right term for MPs who aren't part of a political party. In the UK's parliamentary system, most MPs are affiliated with a specific political party, like the Conservatives, Labour, or the Liberal Democrats. These parties have established platforms, leadership structures, and influence how their members vote on legislation. However, sometimes individuals run for Parliament without aligning themselves with any particular party. These individuals are called "Independents." They might have very specific local concerns or feel that no existing party truly represents their views or the views of their constituents. The term "Independent" clearly reflects their status as standing apart from the established political parties. While "Sole MP" might sound plausible, it simply refers to an MP representing a single-seat constituency, regardless of party affiliation. "Neutrals" and "Civil MP" are not recognised terms in the UK political system. So, "Independents" is the only term that accurately describes MPs who are not members of a political party.
