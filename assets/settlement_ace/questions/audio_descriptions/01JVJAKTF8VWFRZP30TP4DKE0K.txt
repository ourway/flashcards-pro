The Spanish Armada was a massive fleet of ships sent by Spain to invade England in 1588. Think of it as Spain's ambitious attempt to conquer England and re-establish Catholicism as the dominant religion there. Spain, at the time, was a major European power under King Philip II, and he wanted to remove Queen Elizabeth I from the English throne. The Armada's defeat was a pivotal moment in history. It marked the beginning of the decline of Spain's naval dominance and the rise of England as a major sea power. So, when you hear "Spanish Armada," the "Spanish" part is your key clue. It directly tells you the fleet originated from Spain. While France and Italy were also significant European powers, they weren't involved in launching this particular invasion. And South America, as a continent, wasn't a unified power capable of such an undertaking at the time.
