The Welsh Assembly, officially known as the Senedd, has significant devolved powers, meaning it can make its own laws on various matters within Wales. Devolution started in 1999, giving Wales more control over its own affairs. One of the most important areas where the Senedd has full legislative authority is health services. This means they can pass laws and set policies related to healthcare provision, the NHS in Wales, and public health initiatives. This power allows Wales to tailor its health services to the specific needs of its population, which can differ from those in England, Scotland, or Northern Ireland. So, when you see a question about the Welsh Assembly and its power over health services, remember that devolution grants them this authority, making the statement that they can legislate on health services true. It's a key aspect of understanding how the UK is governed and how power is distributed.
