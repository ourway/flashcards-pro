The jury system in the UK is a cornerstone of its justice system, dating back centuries. Think of it as a way to ensure fairness by involving ordinary citizens in deciding someone's fate. Juries are made up of 12 people randomly selected from the general public. Their main job isn't to decide on legal technicalities or what punishment someone should receive. That's the role of the judge. Instead, the jury listens to all the evidence presented during a trial and then, based on that evidence, decides whether they believe the accused person is guilty or not guilty of the crime they're charged with. This decision is called a verdict. The jury's verdict is final on the matter of guilt or innocence. It's a really important responsibility because it directly impacts someone's life and liberty. While other aspects of the trial, like what evidence is admissible or the length of a sentence, are important, they fall outside the jury's specific duty.
