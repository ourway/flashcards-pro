The line of succession to the British throne is determined by Parliament and follows a specific order. The current monarch is King Charles III. Therefore, the person next in line is his eldest son, The Prince of Wales. It's easy to get confused with other members of the Royal Family, but the rules are pretty strict. Prince William, while a prominent figure and future king, is actually second in line because his father, Charles, is ahead of him. Princess Anne and Prince Harry are further down the line of succession due to the rules of primogeniture, which historically favored male heirs. The Prince of Wales is the title traditionally held by the heir apparent, making him the one directly waiting to become king after Charles.
