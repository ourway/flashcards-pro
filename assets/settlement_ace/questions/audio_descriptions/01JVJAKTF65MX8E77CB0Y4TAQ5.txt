Okay, let's break down the question about the 2009 Citizenship Survey and the percentage of people identifying as Muslim. Understanding demographics is a key part of understanding modern Britain. The Citizenship Survey, conducted in 2009, aimed to paint a picture of British society, including its religious makeup. While the UK is predominantly Christian, it also has significant minority religions. Islam is the second largest religion in the UK, but it's important to understand its proportion within the overall population. The survey revealed that around 4% of respondents identified themselves as Muslim. This figure is important because it helps to understand the religious diversity of the UK and to dispel any misconceptions about the size of the Muslim population. It's easy to overestimate, but the survey provides factual data. The other options, 2%, 8%, and 10%, are incorrect because they don't align with the data collected in the 2009 Citizenship Survey. So, remembering that 4% figure gives you an accurate snapshot of the Muslim population as identified in that particular survey.
