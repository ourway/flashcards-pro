The Great Depression, a severe worldwide economic downturn in the 1930s, hit many industries hard, but shipbuilding was particularly vulnerable. Think about it: shipbuilding relies heavily on large-scale investment and international trade. When the global economy falters, demand for new ships plummets. Fewer goods are being traded, fewer people are travelling, and businesses are less willing to invest in expanding their fleets. This leads to a sharp decline in orders, resulting in shipyard closures and mass unemployment in shipbuilding communities. While the railway and automobile industries also faced challenges during the Depression, they weren't as directly tied to international trade and large capital investments as shipbuilding. Aviation, still a relatively new industry at the time, was actually experiencing growth, albeit slower than it might have otherwise. So, while other industries struggled, shipbuilding bore a disproportionate burden due to its reliance on global economic stability.
