Okay, let's talk about venues in the UK. When you think about the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, now known as the SEC, you should immediately associate it with Scotland, specifically Glasgow. It's a major events venue that hosts everything from concerts and conferences to exhibitions. It's been a prominent landmark in Glasgow since it opened in 1985 and has played a significant role in the city's cultural and economic landscape. The other options are all located in England. Wembley Stadium and The O2 are both iconic London venues, hosting major sporting events and concerts. The Troxy is another London venue, known for its art deco architecture and diverse range of events. So, while all are well-known venues, only the SEC calls Scotland home. Remembering that the SEC is in Glasgow will help you answer similar questions about Scottish landmarks or cultural hubs.
