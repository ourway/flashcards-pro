After the Second World War, there was a huge push to rebuild Britain and create a fairer society. People had endured years of hardship and sacrifice, and there was a strong desire for a better future. The Labour government, elected in 1945, responded to this desire by introducing sweeping welfare reforms. The two most significant changes were the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) and a comprehensive social security system. The NHS, launched in 1948, provided free healthcare to all, regardless of their wealth. This was revolutionary at the time. Alongside this, the government established a social security system that offered financial assistance to those in need, including unemployment benefits, sickness benefits, and maternity benefits. While state retirement pensions and employment exchanges existed before this period, the NHS and the universal social security system were the landmark achievements that truly transformed welfare provision in the immediate post-war years, laying the foundation for the modern welfare state.
