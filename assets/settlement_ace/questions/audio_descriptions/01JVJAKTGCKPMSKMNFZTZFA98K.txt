The story of the European Union begins after the devastation of World War II. The idea was to create lasting peace and prosperity through economic and political cooperation. In 1957, six countries – Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands – signed the Treaty of Rome. This treaty established the European Economic Community, or EEC, which is considered the foundation of what we know today as the EU. These six nations wanted to create a common market, allowing goods, services, people, and capital to move freely across their borders. This initial collaboration proved so successful that other countries gradually joined over the decades. So, the statement that the EU was initially established by six western European countries is indeed correct, as these were the founding members who laid the groundwork for the larger union. It's easy to think that nine countries were involved from the start, perhaps confusing it with later expansions, but the core group was definitely six.
