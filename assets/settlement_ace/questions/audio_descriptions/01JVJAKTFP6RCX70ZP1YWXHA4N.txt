Marriage in the UK is fundamentally based on the principle of free consent. This means that every person has the right to choose whether or not they want to marry, and whom they want to marry. This right is protected by law. Forced marriage, where someone is pressured, threatened, or coerced into marrying against their will, is a serious violation of human rights and is therefore illegal. The UK government takes a strong stance against forced marriage, recognizing it as a form of domestic abuse and a violation of individual liberty. Legislation like the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 specifically criminalizes forcing someone into marriage, with perpetrators facing imprisonment. This law reflects the UK's commitment to upholding individual autonomy and protecting vulnerable individuals from exploitation. It's important to remember that cultural or religious traditions can never justify forcing someone into marriage; the law prioritizes individual choice and safety above all else.
