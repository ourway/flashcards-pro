Elizabeth I, who reigned from 1558 to 1603, is considered one of England's most successful monarchs. The 16th century was a turbulent time, marked by religious upheaval and threats from abroad. Elizabeth navigated these challenges skillfully, establishing England as a major European power. She restored the Protestant Church of England after her sister Mary I's reign, which had been marked by the persecution of Protestants. Elizabeth's reign, often called the Elizabethan era, saw a flourishing of the arts, including the works of William Shakespeare. Her image was carefully cultivated to portray her as a strong, intelligent, and devoted ruler, which contributed to her popularity. While Henry VIII was a significant figure, his reign was earlier in the century and known for religious upheaval and his many marriages. Mary I, known as "Bloody Mary," was unpopular due to her persecution of Protestants. Henry VII, while important for establishing the Tudor dynasty, reigned primarily in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, before the period when Elizabeth I became a particularly admired figure.
