Civil law in the UK is all about resolving disagreements between people or organizations. Think of it as a way to settle things fairly when someone feels they've been wronged, but it's not necessarily a criminal act. For example, if you feel you were unfairly fired from your job, or discriminated against, that falls under civil law because it's a dispute between you and your employer. Similarly, if your landlord isn't keeping up their end of the rental agreement, or you bought a faulty product, you can use civil law to seek compensation or resolution. These situations involve individual rights and responsibilities. On the other hand, crimes like carrying a weapon, murder, or theft are offenses against society as a whole. The police and courts get involved to punish the offender and protect the public. So, while those are serious matters, they're dealt with under criminal law, not civil law, which focuses on private disputes.
