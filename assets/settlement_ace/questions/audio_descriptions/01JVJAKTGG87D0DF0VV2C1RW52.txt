Okay, let's talk about some of Britain's sporting heroes. When we think about Paralympians, we're talking about athletes who have achieved incredible things in the face of physical challenges. The Paralympic Games are a huge deal, showcasing amazing talent and determination. Now, Dame Ellen MacArthur is an incredible sailor, known for breaking records in solo around-the-world voyages, and Jessica Ennis-Hill is a celebrated track and field athlete, specifically in the heptathlon, winning gold at the London 2012 Olympics. However, neither of them competed in the Paralympic Games. Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, on the other hand, is one of Britain's most successful Paralympians. She's a wheelchair racer who has won multiple gold medals across several Paralympic Games. Similarly, Ellie Simmonds is a celebrated Paralympic swimmer, also with numerous gold medals to her name. Both have not only excelled in their sports but have also become prominent figures advocating for disability rights and inclusion in the UK. That's why they are the correct answer.
