Okay, let's talk about the last successful invasion of England. The key here is "successful." While there have been attempted invasions since, only one truly managed to conquer and change the course of English history: the Norman Conquest in 1066. Think back to William the Conqueror, who crossed the English Channel from Normandy, France, with his army. They landed and famously fought the Battle of Hastings in October 1066 against the English forces led by King Harold. Harold was killed, and William emerged victorious, establishing Norman rule over England. This event had a profound impact, introducing Norman French language and culture, which significantly shaped the English language, legal system, and social structure. The other dates listed are incorrect because, while there were conflicts and battles, none resulted in a complete takeover of England like the Norman Conquest. So, 1066 is the definitive answer when we're talking about the *last successful* invasion.
