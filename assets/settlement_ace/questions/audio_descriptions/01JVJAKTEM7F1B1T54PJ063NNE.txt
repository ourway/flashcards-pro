Edward VI's short reign is a key moment in Tudor history, particularly because of its impact on the English Reformation. His father, Henry VIII, had broken with the Catholic Church, and Edward, a staunch Protestant, continued to push England further in that direction. He became king in 1547 at the young age of nine. Because he was so young, the country was actually governed by a series of regents and advisors. Edward's reign was marked by significant religious changes, including the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer. However, his health was always fragile, and he succumbed to illness in 1553. He was only 15 years old. This early death is significant because it paved the way for his Catholic half-sister, Mary, to become queen. Mary, often remembered as "Bloody Mary," reversed many of Edward's Protestant reforms, leading to a period of religious persecution. So, while it might be tempting to think he reigned for longer given the impact of his policies, the fact remains that Edward VI died very young, at just 15.
