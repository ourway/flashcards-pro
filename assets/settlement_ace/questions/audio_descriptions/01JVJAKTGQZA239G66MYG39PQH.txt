The Victorian era, named after Queen Victoria, spanned from 1837 to 1901, a period of significant change in Britain. Think of it as a time of industrial revolution, social reform, and empire building. Isambard Kingdom Brunel perfectly embodies this era. He was a brilliant engineer responsible for designing bridges, tunnels, railway lines, and ships â€“ all groundbreaking for their time. Similarly, Florence Nightingale revolutionized nursing and healthcare. During the Crimean War in the 1850s, she improved conditions for wounded soldiers, dramatically reducing mortality rates. She then established nursing as a respected profession. Margaret Thatcher, on the other hand, was Prime Minister much later, from 1979 to 1990. Dylan Thomas, a famous Welsh poet, was born in 1914 and died in 1953, placing him squarely in the 20th century, well after the Victorian period ended. So, Brunel and Nightingale are the figures who truly represent the Victorian era's spirit of innovation and social progress.
