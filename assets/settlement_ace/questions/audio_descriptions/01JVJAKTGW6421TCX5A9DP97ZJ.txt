Sir Francis Drake was a famous English explorer and naval officer during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I in the 16th century. He's best known for his daring voyages and his role in defeating the Spanish Armada. One of his most significant achievements was his circumnavigation of the globe. From 1577 to 1580, Drake captained the 'Golden Hind' on an expedition that took him around the world. This was only the second time this had ever been done, after Magellan's expedition, making Drake a national hero. The voyage was full of challenges, including navigating treacherous waters and facing hostile encounters. While Drake certainly sailed around the British Isles and Europe during his career, the 'Golden Hind' is specifically remembered for its global journey. So, when you think of Drake and the 'Golden Hind', remember their incredible feat of sailing around the entire world.
