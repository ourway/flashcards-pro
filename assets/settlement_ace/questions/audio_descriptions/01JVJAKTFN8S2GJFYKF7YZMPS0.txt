When William the Conqueror and the Normans invaded England in 1066, they brought with them a system of land ownership and social hierarchy called feudalism. Think of it as a pyramid. At the top was the King, who owned all the land. He then granted large portions of this land to loyal followers, known as lords or barons, in exchange for their military service and loyalty. These lords, in turn, divided their land among knights, who would provide military service to the lord. At the bottom were the peasants or serfs, who worked the land for the knights and lords in exchange for protection. So, feudalism was all about land ownership being tied to service and loyalty, creating a structured society. "Noble land" isn't a recognised system, and while the Magna Carta (1215) later limited the King's power, it wasn't the initial land system. Democracy is a system of government, not land ownership. Therefore, feudalism is the correct answer because it accurately describes the land ownership system established by the Normans after their conquest.
