The line of succession to the British throne is determined by a combination of descent, parliamentary statute, and common law. For centuries, it followed male-preference primogeniture, meaning males were prioritized over females. However, the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 changed this, meaning that birth order is now the only factor, regardless of gender. Currently, the Prince of Wales is the heir apparent, meaning he is next in line to become King. This is because he is the eldest son of the current monarch. The Prince of Cambridge is his eldest son, so he is second in line, not first. The Prince of Edinburgh is the younger brother of the current monarch, so he is further down the line of succession. The Duke of York is the brother of the current monarch, but he is further down the line of succession than the Prince of Wales.
