Okay, let's break down what makes up Great Britain. Think of it geographically. The term "Great Britain" refers to the largest island in the British Isles. This island is comprised of three countries: England, Scotland, and Wales. These three have shared a political history for centuries, culminating in the Acts of Union in 1707 (between England and Scotland) and subsequent integrations. Now, it's easy to get confused with the United Kingdom. The UK is a political entity that *includes* Great Britain, but *also* includes Northern Ireland. So, while England and Scotland are definitely part of Great Britain, leaving out Wales would be like missing a leg of a three-legged stool. And including Northern Ireland takes you into the territory of the United Kingdom, which is a broader political entity than just the island of Great Britain. So, remember the island: England, Scotland, and Wales.
