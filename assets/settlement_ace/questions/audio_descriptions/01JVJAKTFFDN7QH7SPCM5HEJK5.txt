Christianity, one of the world's largest religions, is characterized by a diverse range of denominations and traditions that have evolved over centuries. Understanding these different groups is key to appreciating the religious landscape of the UK. Roman Catholicism represents the oldest continuous Christian tradition, tracing its roots back to the early Church in Rome. It's marked by a hierarchical structure led by the Pope and emphasizes sacraments and tradition. Baptists, on the other hand, emerged during the Protestant Reformation, specifically in the 17th century. A core tenet of Baptist belief is believer's baptism, meaning that individuals should be baptized only when they are old enough to understand and profess their faith. This practice distinguishes them from other Christian denominations that practice infant baptism. Therefore, Roman Catholics and Baptists are both distinct groups *within* the broader Christian faith. Buddhists follow the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama and Sikhs follow the teachings of the ten Sikh Gurus.
