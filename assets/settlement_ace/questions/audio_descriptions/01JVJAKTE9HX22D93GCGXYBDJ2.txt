Easter and Christmas are the two most widely observed Christian festivals in the UK, deeply rooted in the religious calendar. Christmas, celebrated on December 25th, commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ and is marked by church services, family gatherings, gift-giving, and traditional meals. Its origins trace back to the Roman festival of Saturnalia, later adapted by Christians. Easter, a moveable feast occurring in the spring, celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, as described in the New Testament. It's a time for church services, family meals, and the giving of Easter eggs, symbolizing new life. While New Year and Halloween are celebrated in the UK, they don't hold the same religious significance within Christianity. New Year is a secular celebration marking the start of the Gregorian calendar year, and Halloween has pagan origins, evolving from Celtic harvest festivals and beliefs about spirits. So, while fun, they aren't primarily Christian religious festivals like Easter and Christmas.
