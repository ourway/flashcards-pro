The Church of Scotland's structure is Presbyterian, which means it's governed by elders, not bishops. This system emerged from the Scottish Reformation in the 16th century, largely influenced by the teachings of John Knox, who admired the reformed churches in Switzerland. The key difference lies in authority: Presbyterian churches vest authority in a group of elders elected by the congregation, promoting a more democratic structure. This contrasts sharply with the hierarchical structure of the Roman Catholic Church, headed by the Pope, or the episcopal system found in the Church of England, which has bishops. While Methodism and Quakerism are significant Protestant denominations in Britain, they have different origins and organizational structures. The Presbyterian system is a defining feature of the Church of Scotland, reflecting its historical commitment to a more egalitarian form of church governance.
