The story of farming in Europe begins in the south-east. Think about the geography â€“ this area is closest to the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, which is widely considered the birthplace of agriculture. Around 6000 BC, people in this region started cultivating crops like wheat and barley, and domesticating animals like sheep and goats. This knowledge and these practices then slowly spread westward and northward across Europe over thousands of years. So, while other regions eventually developed agriculture too, the earliest evidence points to south-east Europe as the starting point for farming on the continent. North-west Asia is close, but the question specifically asks about the origin of farmers in Europe. North-east America had no farming at this time. South-west Europe was affected by the spread of farming, but it was not the origin.
