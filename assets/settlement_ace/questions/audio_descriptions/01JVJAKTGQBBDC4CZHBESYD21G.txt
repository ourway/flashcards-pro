Okay, let's break down why Eid al-Fitr and Eid ul-Adha are celebrated by Muslims. Islam follows a lunar calendar, meaning its months are based on the cycles of the moon. Eid al-Fitr, often called the "Festival of Breaking the Fast," marks the end of Ramadan, the month of fasting. During Ramadan, Muslims abstain from food and drink from dawn until sunset as a form of spiritual discipline and reflection. Eid al-Fitr is a joyous occasion filled with prayers, feasts, and charitable giving. Now, Eid ul-Adha, the "Festival of Sacrifice," commemorates the Prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God. God intervened and provided a ram for sacrifice instead. Muslims often sacrifice an animal, like a sheep or goat, and share the meat with family, friends, and those in need. So, because these festivals are deeply rooted in Islamic traditions, stories, and practices, the correct answer is Islam. While other religions have their own important festivals, Eid is specifically and uniquely associated with the Islamic faith.
