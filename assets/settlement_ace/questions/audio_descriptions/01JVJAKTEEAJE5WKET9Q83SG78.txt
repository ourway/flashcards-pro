The Ashes is the name given to the Test cricket series played between England and Australia. The name has a fascinating origin, dating back to 1882. After Australia beat England at the Oval that year, a satirical obituary was published in a newspaper declaring that English cricket had died, and "the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia." The following winter, when England toured Australia, the English captain was presented with a small urn, supposedly containing the ashes of a bail (one of the wooden pieces on top of the stumps). While the authenticity of the ashes is debated, the name stuck, and the series became known as The Ashes. Lords is a famous cricket ground in London, often called the "home of cricket," but it's a venue, not a competition. The Masters is a prestigious golf tournament, and Classics is too generic to be the right answer. So, the Ashes is the only answer that refers to a specific, long-standing cricket competition between England and Australia.
