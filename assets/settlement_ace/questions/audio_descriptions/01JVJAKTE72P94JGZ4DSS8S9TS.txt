England boasts a rich culinary heritage, though it's sometimes overshadowed! When we think of iconic English dishes, two immediately spring to mind: fish and chips and roast beef. Fish and chips, a simple yet satisfying combination of battered fish and fried potatoes, became popular in the 19th century, fueled by the growth of the fishing industry and the railways that allowed fresh fish to be transported quickly to urban areas. It's a quintessential takeaway meal, often enjoyed by the seaside. Roast beef, on the other hand, is a Sunday lunch staple. It's a tradition that dates back centuries, with different cuts of beef roasted to perfection and served with accompaniments like Yorkshire pudding, roast potatoes, and gravy. While haggis is a national dish of Scotland, consisting of a savory pudding containing sheep's pluck, and Ulster fry is an Irish breakfast dish, fish and chips and roast beef are the dishes most closely associated with English culinary identity.
