The Battle of Britain in 1940 was a pivotal moment in World War II, where the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the UK against the German Luftwaffe. Two aircraft were absolutely vital to this defense: the Spitfire and the Hurricane. The Spitfire, known for its speed and elegance, was a single-seat fighter plane that became a symbol of British resistance. The Hurricane, while slightly less glamorous, was actually more numerous and shot down more enemy aircraft during the Battle of Britain. These two planes complemented each other perfectly, with the Spitfire engaging enemy fighters and the Hurricane targeting bombers. The Mig-21 is a Soviet-designed jet fighter that came into service much later, during the Cold War. The F-22 Raptor is a modern American stealth fighter. So, while those are impressive aircraft, they simply weren't around during World War II, making the Spitfire and Hurricane the correct answer.
