Wales, with its own distinct culture and language, is one of the four countries that make up the United Kingdom, along with England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Cardiff is the capital city of Wales, a vibrant hub with a rich history, including its famous castle and the Millennium Centre. Swansea, another significant Welsh city, is known for its beautiful coastline and maritime heritage. Newport, the third city mentioned, has undergone significant regeneration and is an important industrial and commercial centre in Wales. Because these three cities are located within the borders of Wales, and Wales is a country separate from England, the statement that they are in England is incorrect. It's a common mistake for newcomers to the UK to confuse England with the entire United Kingdom, but remembering that the UK is a union of four distinct countries is key!
