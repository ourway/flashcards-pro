Okay, let's talk about Aberdeen and Dundee. These are both major cities, but they're firmly planted in Scotland, not Northern Ireland. To understand why this is important, remember that the United Kingdom is made up of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Each has its own distinct history and identity. Scotland, in particular, has a strong sense of national pride and a history of being separate from England, even though they're now united under the UK. Aberdeen, known as the "Granite City" because of its distinctive architecture, is a major port and a hub for the oil industry. Dundee, on the other hand, is famous for its jute industry in the past and now has a growing digital media sector. So, while it might be easy to confuse the different parts of the UK, remembering that Aberdeen and Dundee are iconic Scottish cities makes it clear that they couldn't possibly be in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is on the island of Ireland, geographically separate from Great Britain, where Scotland, England, and Wales are located.
