The rose's association with England goes way back to the 15th century and the Wars of the Roses. This wasn't just a regular war; it was a series of civil wars fought between the House of Lancaster, whose symbol was a red rose, and the House of York, symbolized by a white rose. Think of it like a medieval family feud for the throne! Eventually, the Tudor dynasty emerged, uniting the two houses. To symbolize this union, they adopted the Tudor rose, which combines both the red and white roses. Over time, the rose, in its various forms, became deeply ingrained in English identity, appearing in heraldry, literature, and even sports. So, while the shamrock is associated with Ireland, the daffodil with Wales, and the thistle with Scotland, it's the rose that holds that special place as a national emblem for England, steeped in history and representing unity after a period of conflict.
