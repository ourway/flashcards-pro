Think of school governors and school boards as the strategic leaders of a school, similar to a company's board of directors. Their main job isn't the day-to-day running of the school â€“ that's the headteacher and the teachers' responsibility. Instead, governors and board members focus on the bigger picture. They're responsible for setting the overall direction of the school, deciding on its long-term goals, and making sure it's meeting its objectives. They also keep a close eye on how well the school is performing, looking at things like exam results, attendance, and the overall quality of teaching. This monitoring helps them identify areas where the school is doing well and areas where it needs to improve. While fundraising is important, it's not their primary focus, and outdoor activities are definitely outside their remit! Their core function is strategic oversight and performance evaluation, ensuring the school provides the best possible education for its students.
