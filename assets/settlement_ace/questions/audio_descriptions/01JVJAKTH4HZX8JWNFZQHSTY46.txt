The Bayeux Tapestry is a fascinating piece of history, a long embroidered cloth that depicts the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, culminating in the Battle of Hastings. Although it illustrates a key moment in English history, it was actually commissioned in France, likely by Bishop Odo, William the Conqueror's half-brother. The tapestry was created in England, but it has resided in Bayeux, Normandy, France, for almost all of its existence. That's why the correct answer is France. While England is central to the story the tapestry tells, the physical tapestry itself has remained in France for centuries. It's a common misconception to think it would be in England because of the subject matter, but its historical home is across the English Channel.
