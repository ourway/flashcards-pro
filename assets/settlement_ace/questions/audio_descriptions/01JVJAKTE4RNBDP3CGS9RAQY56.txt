Okay, let's explore why the English Parliament developed as a political institution tied to the king's need for money. Think back to the medieval period. Kings needed funds to wage wars, build castles, and generally run the country. Unlike today, they couldn't just decide to raise taxes. They needed the consent of the people who would be paying those taxes, primarily the wealthy landowners and merchants. This is where Parliament comes in. Originally, it was a gathering of these influential people. The king would call them together when he needed money, essentially to negotiate and get their approval for new taxes. In return for agreeing to provide funds, Parliament would often ask the king to address their grievances or make certain concessions. This dynamic – the king needing money and Parliament using that need to gain influence – is what shaped the early development of Parliament. It wasn't about royal marriages or the line of succession; it was fundamentally about finances and the balance of power between the monarch and the people.
