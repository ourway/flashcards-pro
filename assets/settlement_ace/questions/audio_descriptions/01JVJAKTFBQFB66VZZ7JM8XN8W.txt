Okay, so the key thing to remember about the UK's parliamentary system is that it's based on winning individual constituencies, not just racking up the most overall votes nationwide. We use a "first past the post" system. Think of it like a series of mini-elections happening simultaneously across the country. Each area, or constituency, elects one Member of Parliament (MP) to represent them in the House of Commons. The party that wins the *most* of these individual constituency races – meaning they have the most MPs – gets to form the government. It doesn't matter if another party got more total votes across the entire country; what matters is who secured the most seats. This is because the government needs to command the confidence of the House of Commons to pass laws and govern effectively. Having the most MPs gives them that power, even if they didn't win the popular vote. This system has been in place for centuries, evolving alongside the development of Parliament itself, and it's a fundamental aspect of how the UK's democracy functions.
