The Roman Empire, a powerful force in ancient history, made significant inroads into Britain after their initial invasion in 43 AD. They quickly established control over much of what is now England and Wales. However, their ambitions to conquer the entire island faced a formidable challenge in the northern regions, which we now know as Scotland. While the Romans did venture into Scotland, building forts and roads, they never fully subdued the area. The tribes inhabiting Scotland, particularly the Picts, fiercely resisted Roman rule. The construction of Hadrian's Wall, beginning around 122 AD, serves as a physical testament to the limits of Roman control. Later, the Antonine Wall was built further north but was abandoned after a short period. These walls weren't just borders; they were defensive structures against persistent attacks from the north. So, while the Romans certainly made incursions and exerted influence, they never truly conquered all of what is now Scotland, making the statement that areas of Scotland were conquered by the Romans true, but with the important caveat that it was not the *entirety* of Scotland.
