Stonehenge is the iconic Stone Age landmark in the UK. To understand why, let's think about the Stone Age. This period, lasting until around 2300 BC in Britain, was all about early humans using stone tools. Stonehenge, located in Wiltshire, England, dates back to this era, with construction starting around 3000 BC and continuing for centuries. It's a massive circle of standing stones, and archaeologists believe it was used for religious ceremonies or astronomical observations. Now, the other options are much more recent. The Globe Theatre is associated with William Shakespeare in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Nelson's Column commemorates Admiral Horatio Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Windsor Castle, while very old, has been continuously updated and expanded since its initial construction after the Norman Conquest in 1066. So, while they're all important landmarks, they don't fit the "Stone Age" criteria like Stonehenge does. Stonehenge gives us a direct glimpse into the lives and beliefs of people who lived thousands of years ago.
