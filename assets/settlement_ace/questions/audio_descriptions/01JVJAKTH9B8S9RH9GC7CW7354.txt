The Industrial Revolution wasn't a single event, but a period of huge technological and societal change that unfolded over a long time. It really kicked off in Britain around the 1760s with new inventions like the spinning jenny and the steam engine. These inventions revolutionized textile production and power, marking the beginning of factory-based manufacturing. This initial phase, focused on textiles, iron, and steam, largely defines the late 18th century. However, the revolution didn't stop there. Throughout the 19th century, it continued to evolve with advancements in steel production, railways, electricity, and mass production techniques. Think of the Victorian era and the massive expansion of the railway network â€“ that's firmly within the 19th century. So, while the seeds were sown in the 18th century, the Industrial Revolution truly blossomed and transformed Britain throughout the 19th century as well. That's why it's most accurately described as spanning both the 18th and 19th centuries.
