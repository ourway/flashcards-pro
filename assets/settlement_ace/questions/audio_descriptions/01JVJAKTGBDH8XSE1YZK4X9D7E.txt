The National Assembly for Wales, now known as the Welsh Parliament or Senedd Cymru, is the devolved legislature of Wales. Understanding its structure helps you grasp how Wales governs itself within the UK. Unlike the UK Parliament in Westminster, which has hundreds of members, the Senedd is much smaller. This reflects the size and specific needs of Wales. The Senedd was established in 1999, and the number of members has changed over time. Currently, there are 60 members, known as Members of the Senedd, or MSs. They are elected to represent different regions and constituencies across Wales. These members debate and decide on laws that affect Wales, covering areas like health, education, and the environment. So, while 70, 80, or 90 might seem like plausible numbers for a parliament, the Senedd is specifically composed of 60 elected members.
