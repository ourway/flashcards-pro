Queen Elizabeth II's reign was a long and historically significant one, so understanding the jubilees that marked it is important. Jubilees are special celebrations of significant anniversaries of a monarch's reign. The Silver Jubilee marks 25 years, the Golden Jubilee 50 years, the Diamond Jubilee 60 years, and Platinum Jubilee 70 years. Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her Silver Jubilee in 1977 and her Golden Jubilee in 2002. The Diamond Jubilee in 2012 was a huge event, marking 60 years on the throne. Think of a diamond, a precious and durable stone, representing the strength and longevity of her reign. The Platinum Jubilee, marking 70 years, was celebrated in 2022, shortly before her passing. So, while the other jubilees are real and important, the specific milestone commemorated in 2012 was the Diamond Jubilee, marking Queen Elizabeth II's 60th year as monarch.
