York Minster, officially known as the Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Saint Peter in York, is one of the largest cathedrals in Northern Europe and a masterpiece of Gothic architecture. Construction began around 1230 and wasn't really completed until 1472, so it's a testament to centuries of craftsmanship. While the entire building is impressive, it's particularly renowned for its stained glass. York Minster boasts the largest expanse of medieval stained glass in Britain, and some of the oldest pieces date back to the 12th century. The Great East Window, for example, is one of the largest single expanses of stained glass in the world! The vibrant colors and intricate designs depict biblical scenes and stories, creating a breathtaking visual experience for visitors. So, while the Minster is built from stone, it's the stained glass that truly sets it apart and makes it a unique and defining feature. The other options, stained bricks, limestone, or wood, simply aren't features associated with the Minster's architectural fame.
