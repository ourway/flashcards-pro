The story of the UK and the European Union is a long and complex one. The seeds of what would become the EU were sown after World War II, with the aim of fostering economic cooperation and preventing future conflicts. Initially, it was called the European Economic Community, or EEC, and was formed in 1957 by six countries. The UK actually applied to join the EEC twice in the 1960s, but both times, the applications were vetoed by France. It wasn't until January 1st, 1973, that the UK finally became a member, alongside Ireland and Denmark. This was a significant moment, marking a shift in the UK's economic and political landscape. The other dates are incorrect because 1957 was when the EEC was formed, and the UK didn't join at the beginning. The other dates are simply not relevant to the timeline of the UK's EU membership.
