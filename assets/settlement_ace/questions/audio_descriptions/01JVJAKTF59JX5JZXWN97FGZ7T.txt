Visiting Parliament is a right accessible to everyone, regardless of whether they're registered to vote. Think of Parliament as a place that belongs to all the people in the UK, not just those who participate in elections. The idea behind this is to promote transparency and allow citizens to see how their government works firsthand. Historically, access to such institutions was often restricted, but in a modern democracy, openness is key. While being on the electoral register is crucial for voting and participating in the democratic process by choosing your representatives, it has absolutely no bearing on your ability to visit the Houses of Parliament and observe its proceedings or tour the building. You don't need to prove you're registered to vote to enter as a visitor. Some might mistakenly think registration is required because voting is a fundamental civic duty, but visiting Parliament is considered a separate right of access.
