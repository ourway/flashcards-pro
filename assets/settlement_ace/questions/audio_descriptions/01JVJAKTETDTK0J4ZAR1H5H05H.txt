Cricket is uniquely susceptible to weather interruptions, especially rain, and that's why it's so closely tied to the phrase "rain stopped play." Think about it: cricket is played on a large, uncovered grass field, and the condition of that field is crucial. Even a little bit of rain can make the ball behave unpredictably when it bounces, making it dangerous for the batsmen. Umpires have the authority to suspend play if they believe conditions are unsafe or unfair. Unlike sports like football or rugby, where the ball is less affected by a wet surface, cricket relies heavily on the pitch remaining relatively dry and consistent. Plus, the long duration of cricket matches, sometimes lasting for several days, increases the likelihood of rain interruptions. So, while other sports might be affected by rain, it's cricket where the phrase "rain stopped play" has become a common and instantly recognizable part of the game's culture.
