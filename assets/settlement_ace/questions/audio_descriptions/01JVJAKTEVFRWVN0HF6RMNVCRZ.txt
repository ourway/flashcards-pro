The legal age to purchase tobacco products, including cigarettes and vaping products, in the UK is 18. This law is in place to protect young people from the harmful effects of nicotine and to discourage smoking from a young age. While some countries have considered raising the age to 21, or even higher, the UK has maintained the age at 18. So, while it's illegal to sell tobacco to someone under 18, selling to someone who is 25 is perfectly legal. It's easy to get confused because some shops might ask for ID from anyone who looks under 25 as a matter of policy to ensure they don't accidentally sell to someone underage, but that's just a precaution, not the law.
