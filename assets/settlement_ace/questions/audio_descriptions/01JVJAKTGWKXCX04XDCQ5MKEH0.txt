Okay, let's explore the relationship between Wales and England during the reign of King Henry VIII. Before Henry VIII, Wales wasn't really integrated into the English legal system. It was more like a separate territory ruled by the English monarch. However, Henry VIII, who reigned from 1509 to 1547, wanted to consolidate his power and create a more unified kingdom. So, between 1536 and 1543, a series of laws known as the Laws in Wales Acts were passed. These acts essentially integrated Wales into the English legal and administrative system. Welsh shires were given representation in the English Parliament, and English law became the law of the land in Wales. While Welsh culture and language persisted, these acts formally united Wales with England under the English crown. So, the statement is true because these acts, passed during Henry VIII's reign, legally and politically united Wales with England. It's important to remember that this wasn't necessarily a popular move in Wales at the time, but it was a significant step in the political history of the UK.
