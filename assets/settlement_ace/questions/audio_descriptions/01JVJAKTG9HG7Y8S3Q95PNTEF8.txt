Okay, let's talk about the Battle of Bannockburn. This was a hugely significant event in Scottish history, taking place in 1314 near Stirling. Think of it as Scotland's equivalent of the Battle of Hastings in terms of its impact on national identity and independence. The context is the First War of Scottish Independence, a long and bloody struggle against English rule. Now, while William Wallace, made famous by the movie *Braveheart*, was a key figure earlier in the war, leading Scottish resistance, he was executed in 1305, almost a decade before Bannockburn. Malcolm was a much earlier Scottish king. It was Robert the Bruce who took up the mantle of leadership after Wallace. He had himself crowned King of Scots in 1306. The Battle of Bannockburn was a decisive victory for Bruce and his Scottish army against the English forces led by King Edward II. This victory essentially secured Scottish independence, although it wasn't formally recognised by the English until some years later. So, while Wallace was a hero, it was Robert the Bruce who led the Scots to victory at Bannockburn.
