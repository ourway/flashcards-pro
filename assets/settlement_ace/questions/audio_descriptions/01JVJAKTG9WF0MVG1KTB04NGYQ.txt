Skara Brae is a fascinating Neolithic settlement located on the Orkney Islands, which are off the north coast of Scotland. Think of Scotland's geography â€“ it's the northern part of Great Britain, known for its rugged Highlands and many islands. Skara Brae is often called the "Scottish Pompeii" because it's so well-preserved. It was inhabited from roughly 3180 BC to 2500 BC, making it older than Stonehenge and the Egyptian pyramids! The houses are made of stone, and because they were covered by sand dunes for centuries, they remained remarkably intact. This gives us an amazing insight into how people lived in Neolithic times in that part of the world. So, while England, Ireland, and Wales all have rich histories and prehistoric sites, Skara Brae is specifically found in Scotland, making it the only correct answer.
