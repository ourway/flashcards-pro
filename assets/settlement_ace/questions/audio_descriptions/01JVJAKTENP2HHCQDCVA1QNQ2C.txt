Okay, let's break down why profits from self-employment and income from property, savings, and dividends are subject to taxation in the UK. The UK tax system, like most modern systems, is largely based on the principle that income and gains are taxable. This means that when you earn money, whether through working for yourself (self-employment), renting out property, or receiving income from investments like savings accounts or dividends from shares, the government expects a portion of that income as tax. This revenue is then used to fund public services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

Self-employment income is taxed because it's considered earnings just like a salary. Property income, such as rent, is taxed because it's a source of profit. Similarly, income from savings and dividends represents a return on investment, which is also considered taxable income. On the other hand, gifts and shopping vouchers are generally *not* considered taxable income. Gifts are typically seen as transfers of wealth, not earnings, and shopping vouchers are usually considered a form of gift or benefit, rather than direct income. There can be exceptions for very large gifts that might incur inheritance tax, but small, personal gifts are not taxed. So, the key is to remember that the UK tax system primarily targets income and gains, not gifts or benefits in kind.
