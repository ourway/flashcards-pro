Christianity, one of the world's largest religions, isn't a single, unified entity. It's actually a diverse collection of denominations, each with its own interpretations of the Bible and traditions. Think of it like a big family tree with many branches. Roman Catholicism represents one of the oldest and largest branches, tracing its history back to the early Church in Rome. Baptists, on the other hand, emerged much later, during the Protestant Reformation in the 16th and 17th centuries, emphasizing personal faith and the importance of baptism. Now, Buddhism and Sikhism are completely separate religions that originated in Asia. Buddhism, founded by Siddhartha Gautama in ancient India, focuses on enlightenment and overcoming suffering. Sikhism, which originated in the Punjab region of India in the 15th century, emphasizes equality, service, and remembrance of God. So, while all these religions are important and have their own followers, only Baptists and Roman Catholics fall under the umbrella of Christianity.
