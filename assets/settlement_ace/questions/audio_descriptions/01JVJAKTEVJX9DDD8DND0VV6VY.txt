D-Day, which took place on June 6, 1944, is one of the most pivotal moments in World War II. It marks the start of Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy in northern France. This massive military operation involved the landing of thousands of troops on the beaches of Normandy by sea and air. The goal was to liberate Western Europe from Nazi occupation. So, instead of being an evacuation, D-Day was a large-scale invasion. It was the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany. It's easy to get confused with other events, like Dunkirk, where British forces *did* evacuate. But D-Day was about going *in*, not getting *out*. Remembering that D-Day was the start of the Allied invasion, and not a retreat, will help you answer this question correctly.
