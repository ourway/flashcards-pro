Hadrian's Wall, constructed around 122 AD under the Roman Emperor Hadrian, wasn't just a continuous barrier; it was a sophisticated military zone. Think of it as a fortified border designed to control movement and defend against raids from the tribes north of Roman Britain, primarily the Picts. Along the wall, the Romans built forts to house soldiers, store supplies, and act as observation posts. Vindolanda and Housesteads are two of the most well-known and best-preserved of these forts. Vindolanda, predating the wall itself, was a vital supply and administrative center, famous for the Vindolanda tablets â€“ incredible Roman-era letters written on thin wooden leaves that give us amazing insights into daily life. Housesteads, perched on a dramatic ridge, offered a commanding view of the surrounding landscape, making it a key strategic point. Maiden Castle, on the other hand, is an Iron Age hill fort, and Grimsby is a town with Viking origins, so neither are connected to Hadrian's Wall.
