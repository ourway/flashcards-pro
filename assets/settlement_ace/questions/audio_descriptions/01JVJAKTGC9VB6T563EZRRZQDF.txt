Okay, let's talk about Charles I and his turbulent relationship with Parliament. In the 17th century, English monarchs and Parliament were often at odds, especially over money and power. Charles I believed in the Divine Right of Kings, the idea that he was appointed by God and shouldn't be questioned. This clashed directly with Parliament's desire to have a say in how the country was run, particularly when it came to raising taxes. Frustrated by Parliament's resistance, Charles decided to rule without them. This period, lasting from 1629 to 1640, is known as Charles I's "Personal Rule" or the "Eleven Years' Tyranny" by his opponents. He tried to raise money through other means, which proved unpopular. Eventually, a rebellion in Scotland forced his hand. He needed funds to fight the Scots, and the only way to get them was to call Parliament back into session after 11 long years. This eventually led to the English Civil War, and ultimately, Charles' execution. So, the correct answer is 11 because it accurately reflects the length of time Charles I attempted to govern without Parliament, a pivotal period in British history.
