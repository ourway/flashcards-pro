The British national anthem, "God Save the Queen" (or King, depending on the monarch), is a song steeped in tradition and symbolism. It originated as a patriotic song in 1745, during a time of Jacobite rebellion, and quickly gained popularity as a way to express loyalty to the Crown. The words themselves are a prayer for the monarch's well-being and a declaration of national unity. Now, when we look at the specific wording of the first verse, it directly addresses the monarch. While terms like "Royal" or "Her Majesty" are certainly fitting descriptions of the Queen, they aren't actually *in* the lyrics. The anthem uses the word "Noble" to describe her: "God save our gracious Queen, long live our noble Queen." So, while you might associate royalty with majesty or gentleness, the anthem specifically uses "noble" in that opening verse. It's a direct quote from a very well-known song!
