The Scottish Parliament, officially opened in 1999, is designed to be a representative body reflecting the will of the Scottish people. Think about it: Scotland has a population of over five million people! To properly represent such a large and diverse group, you need more than just a handful of representatives. The Scottish Parliament actually has 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament, or MSPs. These MSPs are elected through a system that combines geographical constituencies and regional lists, ensuring a broad range of voices are heard. So, while 33 might sound like a reasonable number at first glance, it's far too small to effectively represent the people of Scotland and fulfill the Parliament's role in creating laws and holding the Scottish Government to account.
