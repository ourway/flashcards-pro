The UK has strict laws regarding the sale and consumption of alcohol, primarily aimed at protecting young people. Historically, concerns about the impact of alcohol on youth have led to increasingly stringent regulations. The legal drinking age is 18, and this isn't just a suggestion â€“ it's the law. Selling alcohol to someone under 18 is a criminal offense because it directly violates this law and puts the seller at risk of fines, license revocation, or even imprisonment. Similarly, buying alcohol for someone under 18, even if you're a parent or older sibling, is also illegal. This is because it's seen as enabling underage drinking and circumventing the laws designed to protect young people. While going to surgery without booking an appointment or going to the hospital without a letter from your GP might be inconvenient or cause delays, they are not criminal offenses. The National Health Service (NHS) prioritizes emergency care, and while appointments are generally required for non-emergency procedures, bypassing these procedures doesn't constitute a crime.
