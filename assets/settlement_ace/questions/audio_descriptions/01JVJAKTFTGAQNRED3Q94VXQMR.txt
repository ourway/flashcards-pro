Charles Dickens was a hugely influential Victorian novelist, known for his social commentary and vivid characters. He wrote extensively about the lives of the poor and the injustices of Victorian society. "Great Expectations," published in 1861, follows the story of Pip, an orphan who unexpectedly comes into wealth and navigates the complexities of social class. "Oliver Twist," published serially from 1837 to 1839, tells the tale of another orphan, Oliver, who escapes a workhouse and becomes entangled with a gang of pickpockets in London. Both novels are quintessential Dickens, exploring themes of poverty, social mobility, and the human condition. While "Harry Potter" is a beloved modern series by J.K. Rowling and "Pride and Prejudice" is a classic by Jane Austen, they are from completely different eras and authors. Dickens's works are deeply rooted in the 19th century, making "Great Expectations" and "Oliver Twist" the correct choices.
