One of the core principles underpinning life in the UK, and indeed most democratic societies, is the idea of individual responsibility. While citizens and permanent residents certainly benefit from a range of public services and protections provided by the state, a fundamental expectation is that individuals will strive to be self-sufficient and care for their immediate family. This doesn't mean ignoring the needs of others or shirking civic duties, but rather ensuring your own well-being and that of your dependents is a priority. This reduces the burden on the state and allows resources to be directed towards those most in need. While finding illegal immigrants is the responsibility of law enforcement, keeping your dog on a lead is a local bylaw, and growing your own vegetables is a hobby, looking after yourself and your family is a primary and universal responsibility.
