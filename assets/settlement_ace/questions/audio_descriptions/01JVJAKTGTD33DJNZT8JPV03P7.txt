Wales boasts a rich culinary heritage, and certain foods are deeply intertwined with its identity. Welsh cakes, also known as *pice ar y maen* (cakes on the stone), are a perfect example. These small, round griddle cakes are made with flour, butter, eggs, milk, and spices, and often include dried fruit like currants or raisins. They're traditionally cooked on a bakestone, a flat griddle, giving them a slightly crisp exterior and a soft, fluffy interior. Welsh cakes have been a staple in Welsh households for generations, often served warm with butter or sprinkled with sugar. They are a popular treat for tea time and are frequently found at cultural events and celebrations throughout Wales. While haggis is famously Scottish, Ulster fry is from Northern Ireland, and roast beef, although popular in Britain, isn't specifically linked to Wales in the same traditional way as Welsh cakes.
