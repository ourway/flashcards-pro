The Council of Europe, established in 1949 in the wake of World War II, plays a vital role in upholding human rights, democracy, and the rule of law across its member states. It was founded to prevent the atrocities of the war from ever happening again. The Council's most well-known achievement is the European Convention on Human Rights, which was created in 1950. This convention outlines fundamental rights and freedoms, such as the right to life, freedom of expression, and the right to a fair trial. The European Court of Human Rights ensures that member states comply with the Convention. Therefore, the Council of Europe is fundamentally responsible for protecting and promoting human rights within its member countries because that is the core purpose of its existence and the very reason it was founded. It's not just a suggestion; it's a duty enshrined in its founding principles and ongoing work.
