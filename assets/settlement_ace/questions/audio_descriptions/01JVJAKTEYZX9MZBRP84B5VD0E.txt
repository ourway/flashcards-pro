The period known as "The Troubles" in Northern Ireland was a deeply divisive and violent conflict that lasted for about 30 years, beginning in the late 1960s. It was primarily a political and sectarian conflict rooted in complex historical, social, and nationalistic issues. The main participants were primarily Irish nationalists (mainly Roman Catholic) who desired Northern Ireland to become part of the Republic of Ireland, and unionists (mainly Protestant) who wanted Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. While it's impossible to put an exact figure on the loss of life, as records can vary and some disappear, the generally accepted estimate is around 3,000 people killed as a direct result of the Troubles. This includes civilians, paramilitary members, and security forces. While the other numbers might seem plausible, historical records and analyses consistently point to the 3,000 figure as the most accurate representation of the tragic loss of life during this period.
