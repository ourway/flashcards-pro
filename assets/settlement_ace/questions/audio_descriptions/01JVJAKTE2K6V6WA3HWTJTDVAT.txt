Okay, let's unravel the story behind the Wars of the Roses. This was a series of bloody civil wars fought in England during the 15th century, specifically from 1455 to 1487. Now, the key players weren't political bodies like the House of Commons or Lords, but two powerful families vying for the English throne: the House of Lancaster and the House of York. Think of it like a medieval family feud, but with crowns and armies involved! The House of Lancaster was symbolized by a red rose, and the House of York by a white rose â€“ hence the name, "Wars of the Roses." These families were both descended from King Edward III, and each believed they had a legitimate claim to the throne. Battles raged, kings were overthrown, and many nobles lost their lives before Henry Tudor, who had Lancastrian connections, defeated Richard III of York at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Henry then married Elizabeth of York, uniting the two houses and bringing an end to the wars. So, when you think of the civil war between loyalists, remember the red and white roses, and that will lead you straight to the Houses of Lancaster and York.
