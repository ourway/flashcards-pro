Okay, let's talk about women's suffrage in the UK. The fight for women's right to vote was a long and hard-won battle, spanning decades. While some women, specifically those over 30 who met certain property qualifications, gained the right to vote in 1918, this wasn't full equality. Think about it: that law still excluded many women based on age and wealth. It wasn't until ten years later, in 1928, that the Representation of the People Act was passed. This act lowered the voting age for women to 21, the same as men, and removed those pesky property qualifications. So, 1928 is the key year because it marks the point when all women over 21 could finally participate in elections on the same terms as men, achieving true voting equality. It's easy to get confused with 1918, but remember that was just a partial victory. 1928 is when the job was truly finished!
