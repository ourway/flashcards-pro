Alright, let's talk about Bonnie Prince Charlie and his army. To understand where his troops came from, we need a bit of background on the Jacobite risings. These were attempts to restore the Stuart family to the British throne. Charles Edward Stuart, or Bonnie Prince Charlie, was the grandson of the deposed King James II. In 1745, he landed in Scotland hoping to rally support. Now, while he aimed to gain support across Britain, his strongest base was definitely in the Scottish Highlands. The Highland clans, with their traditional clan system and warrior culture, were largely loyal to the Stuart cause. They saw the Stuarts as their rightful rulers and were willing to fight for them. So, while you might think of Edinburgh or Glasgow as major Scottish cities, and therefore sources of troops, the real power base for Bonnie Prince Charlie was in the Highlands. The Borders region, while also Scottish, didn't have the same level of Jacobite support at that time. The Highland clans provided the bulk of his army in 1745, making the Highlands the correct answer.
