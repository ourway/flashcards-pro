Saint David, or Dewi Sant in Welsh, is the patron saint of Wales, and March 1st is the day dedicated to celebrating him. He lived in the 6th century and was known for founding monastic settlements and promoting Christianity throughout Wales. The day is a celebration of Welsh culture and heritage. People often wear traditional Welsh dress, including the Welsh national symbol, the daffodil, or the leek. Schools hold concerts and eisteddfodau, which are festivals of Welsh literature, music, and performance. While it's not a public holiday in the same way as Christmas or bank holidays, there's a strong movement to make it one. So, while England has St. George's Day, Ireland has St. Patrick's Day, and Scotland has St. Andrew's Day, St. David's Day is specifically and uniquely associated with Wales.
