Mothering Sunday, also known as Mother's Day, has a fascinating history that goes beyond just celebrating mums with flowers and cards. Originally, it was linked to the medieval church calendar. People would return to their 'mother church' – the main church or cathedral in their area – for a special service during Lent. This pilgrimage became a social occasion, with servants and apprentices often given the day off to visit their families and their mother church. Over time, the religious aspect intertwined with the more general celebration of motherhood. The key to remembering when it falls is that it's always the fourth Sunday of Lent. Lent is the 40-day period leading up to Easter. Easter's date changes each year based on the lunar calendar, which means Mothering Sunday also moves. So, if you count back from Easter, you'll find that Mothering Sunday is celebrated exactly three weeks before Easter Sunday, not two. Thinking of it as "Mother's 3-day" can be a helpful memory trick!
