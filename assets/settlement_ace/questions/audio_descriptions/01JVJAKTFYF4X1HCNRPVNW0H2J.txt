Okay, let's talk about New Delhi and its connection to British history. During the British Raj, which lasted from 1858 to 1947, India was under British rule. Initially, Calcutta (now Kolkata) served as the capital. However, in 1911, King George V declared that the capital would be moved to Delhi. The reasoning behind this was partly strategic, as Delhi was seen as more centrally located and historically significant, having been the seat of power for many previous empires. To create a capital worthy of the British Empire, the renowned British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens was commissioned to design a new city â€“ New Delhi. Lutyens envisioned a city with grand avenues, impressive buildings, and formal gardens, reflecting British power and authority. Construction began in the 1920s, and New Delhi officially became the capital in 1931. So, when you hear about a city designed by Lutyens in the 20th century to be the government center of India, New Delhi is the only answer that fits that historical context. The other cities were important centers, but not designed as a new capital by the British.
