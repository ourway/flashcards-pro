The Turner Prize is all about showcasing what's new and exciting in the art world right now. It was established in 1984 and named after the famous English painter J.M.W. Turner, known for his innovative and sometimes controversial landscape paintings. The prize isn't about celebrating traditional art forms or historical masterpieces; instead, it focuses on contemporary art. This means art that is being created in the present day, often pushing boundaries and exploring new ideas and mediums. While there are many awards that celebrate music and theatre, the Turner Prize specifically aims to recognise British visual artists for outstanding exhibitions of their work in the previous year. So, if you're thinking about the Turner Prize, remember it's all about what's happening in the world of contemporary art.
