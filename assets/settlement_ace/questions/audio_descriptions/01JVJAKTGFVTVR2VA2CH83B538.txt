Okay, so Henry VIII and the Church of England â€“ it's a really pivotal moment in British history. Before Henry, England was a Catholic country, with the Pope in Rome as the head of the Church. Henry VIII wanted to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, because she hadn't produced a male heir. He needed a son to secure the Tudor dynasty! The Pope, however, refused to grant the divorce, largely because Catherine was the aunt of the Holy Roman Emperor, a very powerful figure. Henry, being the headstrong king he was, decided to take matters into his own hands. In 1534, he passed the Act of Supremacy, declaring himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England. This effectively broke England away from the Roman Catholic Church and allowed him to get his divorce and marry again. So, yes, it's absolutely true that Henry VIII established the Church of England because the Pope wouldn't grant him a divorce. It wasn't just about personal desire, though; it was also about power and control over the country.
