Okay, let's talk about St. Augustine and the spread of Christianity in Britain. In 597 AD, Pope Gregory the Great sent Augustine and a group of missionaries from Rome to England. Now, think about where Rome is in relation to England. Rome is located south of England. So, to get to England, Augustine and his missionaries would have travelled north. However, the question asks about the direction they took to *propagate* or spread Christianity, not the direction they initially travelled *to* England. Augustine landed in Kent, in the south of England, and established his base there. From Kent, he and his followers then spread Christianity to other parts of the country. So, while they came *from* the south, their work of spreading the faith radiated *southwards* from their base in Kent to other areas. It's a subtle but important distinction. The other directions – north, east, and west – don't accurately reflect the primary direction of the Christian mission's expansion from its starting point in Kent.
