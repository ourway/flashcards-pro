Organ donation is a really important topic, and it's great to know the facts. When we talk about donating a kidney, it's actually possible to do this while you're still alive. This is called living donation. Because you only need one kidney to live a healthy life, a person can choose to donate one of their kidneys to someone in need. This is often done to help a family member or close friend who has kidney failure. Of course, there are strict medical tests and evaluations to make sure the donor is healthy enough and that the donation is a good match for the recipient. While donating organs after death is also crucial and saves many lives, the specific question here is about donating a kidney while alive, which is indeed possible and a testament to the incredible generosity of people willing to help others in this way. It's not limited to family either; altruistic donation to a stranger is also possible.
