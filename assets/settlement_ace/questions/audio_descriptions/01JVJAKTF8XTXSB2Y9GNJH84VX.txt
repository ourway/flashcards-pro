The Northern Ireland Assembly, located at Stormont in Belfast, is where locally elected Members of the Legislative Assembly, or MLAs, make laws and debate important issues for Northern Ireland. Unlike the UK Parliament in London, which deals with national matters, the Northern Ireland Assembly focuses on regional concerns like healthcare, education, and local government. Because the Assembly encourages public engagement, they offer educational programs and tours. The best way to arrange a visit is by directly contacting either the Education Service at the Assembly, which organizes educational visits for schools and groups, or by contacting an MLA, a local representative, who can often arrange a tour or meeting. It's important to remember that MSPs, or Members of the Scottish Parliament, operate in Scotland, not Northern Ireland, so contacting them would be incorrect. While visitor services might exist, the most direct and effective approach is through the Education Service or an MLA.
