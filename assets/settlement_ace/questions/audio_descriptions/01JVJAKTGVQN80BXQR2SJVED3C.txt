The fight for women's suffrage in the UK was a long and arduous process, gaining significant momentum in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, it was the First World War (1914-1918) that proved to be a major turning point. With millions of men away fighting, women stepped into roles traditionally held by men, working in factories, hospitals, and farms, essentially keeping the country running. This widespread contribution shattered pre-existing societal norms and demonstrated women's capabilities beyond the domestic sphere. While women's suffrage movements had been campaigning for decades, the undeniable contribution during the First World War created a strong argument for their right to vote. In 1918, the Representation of the People Act granted the vote to women over 30 who met certain property qualifications. It wasn't until 1928 that women achieved equal voting rights with men, lowering the voting age to 21 for all. So, while women continued to contribute significantly in later conflicts, it was the First World War that provided the crucial catalyst for initial voting rights.
