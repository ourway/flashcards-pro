The age of 18 is a significant milestone in the UK, marking the point at which a person gains full adult rights and responsibilities. Historically, the age of majority varied, but it was lowered to 18 in 1969 with the Family Law Reform Act. This change aligned with the idea that young adults should have the right to vote, enter into contracts, and make their own decisions. Because of this, 18 is the age at which you can legally purchase alcohol, vote in elections, and, relevant to this question, enter betting shops or gambling clubs. This is because gambling, like alcohol consumption, is seen as an activity that requires a certain level of maturity and understanding of potential risks. While 16 and 17-year-olds have some rights, such as leaving home with parental consent or joining the armed forces, they are still considered minors in many legal contexts. Raising the age to 21, as it is in some countries for certain activities, would be inconsistent with the UK's established age of majority.
