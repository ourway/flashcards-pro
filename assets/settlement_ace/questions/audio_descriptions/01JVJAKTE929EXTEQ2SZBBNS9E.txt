Okay, let's break down why the devolved administrations having their own civil services is indeed true. Devolution, which started in the late 1990s under Tony Blair's government, essentially transferred certain powers from the UK Parliament in Westminster to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Think of it like setting up regional governments with specific responsibilities. Now, to actually *run* these devolved areas effectively, each needs its own administrative machinery â€“ that's where the civil service comes in. Each devolved administration has its own civil service to support its government in developing and implementing policies specific to their region. So, Scotland has the Scottish Government civil service, Wales has the Welsh Government civil service, and Northern Ireland has its own Northern Ireland Civil Service. These civil servants are responsible for advising ministers, managing public services, and ensuring that the devolved governments function smoothly. It's important to remember that while these civil services work within the UK framework, they are separate from the UK civil service, which primarily supports the UK government in Westminster.
