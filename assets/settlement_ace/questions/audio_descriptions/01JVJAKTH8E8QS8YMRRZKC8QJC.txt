Valentine's Day, celebrated annually on February 14th, is rooted in both ancient Roman festivals and Christian traditions honoring Saint Valentine. Over centuries, it evolved into a celebration of love and affection. The exchange of gifts and cards is a central custom, symbolizing romantic feelings and appreciation. While some might think of Valentine's Day as solely for couples, it's also common to express affection to friends and family. The tradition of sending anonymous cards to secret admirers is indeed a part of the Valentine's Day lore, adding an element of mystery and excitement to the day. This practice, while perhaps less common now with the rise of social media, still exists and contributes to the overall spirit of the holiday. So, the statement is true because the exchange of gifts, cards, and even anonymous cards to secret crushes are all established parts of Valentine's Day customs.
