The Enlightenment, an influential intellectual and cultural movement of the 17th and 18th centuries, championed reason and individual liberty. Think of it as a period where people started questioning traditional authority and emphasizing human rights. A core tenet of this movement was the idea that individuals should have the freedom to practice their religion without state interference and to express their political opinions openly. Before the Enlightenment, many European societies were characterized by religious persecution and strict censorship. Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke argued for religious tolerance and freedom of thought, influencing the development of democratic societies. While the Enlightenment did contribute to the development of democracy, it wasn't about establishing "complete democracy" immediately. Similarly, while new technologies emerged during this period, they weren't the central focus. The key was liberating the mind and spirit, allowing people to think and believe freely.
