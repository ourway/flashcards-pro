Oliver Cromwell was a key figure in 17th-century British history, particularly during the period of the English Civil Wars. These wars were fought between those who supported the monarchy and those who favoured a parliamentary system of government. Cromwell was a leading general on the Parliamentarian side, and he played a crucial role in their victory. Now, Scotland at this time had close ties to the monarchy, and they supported Charles II's claim to the English throne after his father, Charles I, was executed. This led to military clashes between Cromwell's forces and the Scottish army. The Battles of Dunbar in 1650 and Worcester in 1651 were decisive victories for Cromwell, effectively crushing Scottish support for the monarchy and solidifying the Parliamentarian control over Britain. The other options, while significant figures in British history, were not military leaders involved in these battles. Robert Burns was a poet, William Shakespeare a playwright, and Isaac Newton a scientist.
