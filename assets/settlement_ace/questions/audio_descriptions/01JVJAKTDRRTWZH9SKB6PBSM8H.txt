Henry VIII's marital life is one of the most talked-about aspects of Tudor history, and understanding it is key to understanding the religious and political upheaval of the 16th century. Henry was desperate for a male heir to secure the Tudor dynasty, and this desire heavily influenced his decisions. He initially married Catherine of Aragon, but when she failed to produce a male heir, he sought an annulment from the Pope. When the Pope refused, Henry broke with the Roman Catholic Church and established the Church of England, making himself the head. This allowed him to divorce Catherine and marry Anne Boleyn. Anne also failed to produce a surviving male heir and was eventually executed. He then married Jane Seymour, who finally gave him a son, Edward, but she died shortly after childbirth. After Jane, Henry married Anne of Cleves for political reasons, but the marriage was quickly annulled. His fifth wife, Catherine Howard, was also executed for treason. Finally, he married Catherine Parr, who outlived him. So, when we count them all up: Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard, and Catherine Parr, that makes a grand total of six wives for Henry VIII.
