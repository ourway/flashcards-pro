Okay, let's talk about St. Andrew's Day and why it's Scotland's national day. St. Andrew was one of Jesus's apostles, and he became the patron saint of Scotland way back in the Middle Ages. Legend has it that some of his relics were brought to Scotland, making him a significant figure in Scottish religious and national identity. Now, St. Andrew's Day is celebrated on November 30th each year. It's a day for Scots to celebrate their culture, heritage, and national pride. You'll find ceilidhs (traditional Gaelic social gatherings), Scottish music, dancing, and of course, plenty of Scottish food and drink. While England and Wales have their own patron saints and national days – St. George's Day for England and St. David's Day for Wales – St. Andrew is specifically tied to Scotland, making November 30th their national day. So, when you think of St. Andrew, think of Scotland!
