World War II in Europe was a long and devastating conflict, lasting nearly six years. Germany's aggressive expansion across Europe began in 1939, leading to a global war involving numerous countries. The Allies, including Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, fought against the Axis powers, primarily Germany, Italy, and Japan. After years of intense fighting, including major battles like the Battle of Britain and the D-Day landings, the tide began to turn in favor of the Allies. By early 1945, Germany was facing defeat on both the Eastern and Western fronts. Finally, in May 1945, Germany surrendered unconditionally to the Allies. This surrender marked the end of World War II in Europe, bringing an end to years of bloodshed and devastation. While the war continued in the Pacific against Japan for a few more months, May 1945 is remembered as the month when peace returned to Europe after a long and hard-fought struggle.
