The House of Lords, one of the two houses of Parliament, includes different types of members. Some are hereditary peers, who inherit their titles, while others are appointed for their lifetime. These are known as Life Peers. Now, while the Queen is the Head of State and plays a role in approving legislation, the actual nomination of individuals to become Life Peers rests with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister recommends individuals who have made significant contributions to public life, whether in arts, science, business, or other fields. The Archbishop of Canterbury, while a very important religious figure, doesn't have a role in these appointments. So, although the Queen formally appoints them, it's the Prime Minister who decides who gets nominated, making that the correct answer. It's a system that allows the government to bring expertise and experience into the House of Lords.
