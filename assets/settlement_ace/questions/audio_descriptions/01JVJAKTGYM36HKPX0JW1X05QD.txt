Devolution, which started in the late 1990s, granted Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland greater control over their own affairs. Think of it like giving someone the keys to a house, but not the entire property portfolio! Each devolved administration has specific powers, like managing healthcare, education, and some aspects of transport. However, the UK Parliament in Westminster retains significant authority. Key areas like defense, foreign policy, immigration, and national security remain under the control of the central UK government. So, while the devolved administrations can create laws and policies tailored to their specific needs, their powers are not absolute. They operate within a framework set by the UK Parliament, which can still legislate on devolved matters in certain circumstances. This ensures a unified approach to core national issues and prevents each region from acting completely independently.
