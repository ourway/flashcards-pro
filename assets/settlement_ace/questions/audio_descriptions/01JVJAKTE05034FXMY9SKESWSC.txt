Golf's story begins way back in 15th-century Scotland. Picture the Scottish Highlands â€“ rolling hills, sandy dunes, and plenty of open space. It's said that shepherds, while tending their flocks, would use their crooks to hit stones into rabbit holes. This pastime evolved over time into the game we know today. The earliest rules of golf were established in Scotland, and the first golf clubs were formed there. While football, rugby, and tennis are all popular sports in the UK, they didn't originate in Scotland during that specific period. Football's origins are debated, but it wasn't codified until the 19th century in England. Rugby also developed in 19th-century England. Tennis has even older roots, but its modern form emerged in England in the late 19th century. So, while you might enjoy a good game of tennis on the Wimbledon courts or a football match at Wembley, remember that golf is the sport with its historical heart firmly planted in the Scottish landscape.
