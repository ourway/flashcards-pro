Okay, here's an explanation about banknotes in the UK:

The fact that some parts of the UK issue their own banknotes is a really interesting quirk of the British financial system. While the Bank of England issues banknotes that are legal tender in England and Wales, it's not the only game in town. Historically, Scottish banks have had the right to issue their own banknotes since the Bank of Scotland was founded in 1695. This right was maintained even after the Act of Union in 1707, which unified Scotland and England. Northern Ireland also has banks that issue their own notes. These banknotes, while not technically legal tender throughout the UK, are accepted as currency. You might see them being used in England, but shops aren't obligated to accept them. So, while you might think that only the Bank of England prints money, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own versions circulating, making it true that they issue their own banknotes valid across the UK.
