Wales has a fascinating religious history that sets it apart from England. For centuries, the Church of England was also the established church in Wales. However, this changed in 1920 when the Church in Wales was disestablished. Disestablishment essentially means that the church is no longer officially linked to the state. This was a significant moment, reflecting a growing sense of Welsh national identity and a desire for religious independence. So, while England still has the Church of England as its established church, Wales does not have a state-sponsored or official church. This separation allows for a more diverse religious landscape in Wales, where various denominations and faiths coexist. It's easy to get confused because of the historical connection, but the key takeaway is that since 1920, Wales has had no established church.
