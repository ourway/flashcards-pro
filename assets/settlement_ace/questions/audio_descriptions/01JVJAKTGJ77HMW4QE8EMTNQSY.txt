The UK, despite its beautiful countryside, is a highly urbanized nation. This stems from the Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the 18th century. Factories and industries sprung up in towns and cities, drawing people from rural areas in search of work and better opportunities. This led to a significant population shift and the growth of urban centers like London, Manchester, and Birmingham. While agriculture remains important, the majority of the population continues to reside in towns and cities because that's where most of the jobs, services, and infrastructure are concentrated. Even though the UK has stunning rural landscapes, the economic and social pull of urban life means that towns and cities are where you'll find most people living.
