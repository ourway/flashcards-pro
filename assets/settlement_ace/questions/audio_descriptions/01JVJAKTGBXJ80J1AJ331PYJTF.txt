Okay, let's break down why devolved administrations can pass laws on health and education. Think of the UK as a family with different branches. The central government in Westminster handles the big, overarching issues that affect the whole family, like defense, immigration, and foreign policy. However, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have their own devolved governments, sort of like having regional managers. These devolved administrations are responsible for issues that directly impact the daily lives of people within their specific regions. Health and education are prime examples of this. Each devolved administration can tailor healthcare policies and education systems to best suit the needs of its population. For example, Scotland might have a different approach to university tuition fees than England. This is because education is a devolved matter. Similarly, healthcare policies, like how prescriptions are handled, can vary between Wales and Northern Ireland. Foreign affairs and immigration, on the other hand, are reserved powers, meaning they are handled exclusively by the UK Parliament in Westminster to ensure a unified approach across the entire United Kingdom.
