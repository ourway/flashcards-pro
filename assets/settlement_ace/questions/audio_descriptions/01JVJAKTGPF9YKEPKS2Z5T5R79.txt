Okay, so the official name of the country is indeed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It's a bit of a mouthful, but understanding where that name comes from helps. "Great Britain" refers to the island that comprises England, Scotland, and Wales. The "United Kingdom" part came about through various Acts of Union. The first was in 1707, uniting England and Scotland to form Great Britain. Then, in 1801, Ireland was joined, creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. However, most of Ireland became independent in 1922. The six counties of Northern Ireland chose to remain part of the UK, hence the final addition to the name: "and Northern Ireland." So, while it's often shortened to just "UK," the full, official title reflects this history of unification and includes all the constituent parts of the country. Remembering that historical process makes it easier to recall the full name.
