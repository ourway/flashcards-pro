The laws surrounding alcohol consumption in the UK are pretty strict, and they're designed to protect young people. The legal age for purchasing alcohol in pubs, off-licences (shops that sell alcohol), and supermarkets is 18. This law is in place to prevent underage drinking and the potential health and social problems associated with it. While someone aged 16 or 17 *can* drink beer, cider, or wine with a meal in a licensed premises (like a restaurant or pub) if accompanied by an adult, they absolutely cannot purchase it themselves. So, the idea that a 15-year-old could legally buy alcohol is incorrect. It's easy to get confused about the different rules around drinking versus buying, but remember the key takeaway: buying alcohol is off-limits until you're 18.
