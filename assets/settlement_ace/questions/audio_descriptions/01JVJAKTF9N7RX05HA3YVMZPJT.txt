The Hundred Years' War, a series of conflicts fought between England and France, is a classic example of a historical misnomer. Despite its name, the war didn't actually last for exactly one hundred years. It stretched from 1337 to 1453, adding up to a total of 116 years. The conflict was rooted in English kings claiming the French throne and disputes over land in France. Think of it as a really long, drawn-out family feud between the English and French monarchies. While it might be tempting to assume it lasted exactly 100 years because of the name, remembering the start and end dates reveals the true duration. So, even though it's called the Hundred Years' War, it's a bit of a historical fib â€“ it actually went on for 116 years.
