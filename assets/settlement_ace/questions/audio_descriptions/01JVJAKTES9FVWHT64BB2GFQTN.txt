The English Civil Wars, a tumultuous period in British history during the 17th century, pitted the Royalists, who supported King Charles I, against the Parliamentarians, who wanted more power for Parliament. The wars were essentially about who should govern England. Now, thinking about key battles, Marston Moor in 1644 was a significant Parliamentarian victory, marking a turning point in the North. Then, Naseby in 1645 saw the New Model Army, Parliament's highly disciplined force, decisively defeat the King's main army. These two battles were crucial in weakening the Royalist cause and ultimately led to Parliament's victory and the eventual execution of Charles I. Waterloo, on the other hand, was a famous battle where the Duke of Wellington defeated Napoleon in 1815, long after the Civil Wars. And Hastings? That was way back in 1066, when William the Conqueror invaded England! So, Marston Moor and Naseby are the battles firmly rooted in the English Civil Wars.
