The English and Welsh legal system has a hierarchy of courts, and civil cases are handled differently depending on their severity. Think of it like a pyramid, with smaller claims being dealt with at the base in county courts. As the value of the claim and the complexity of the legal issues increase, the case moves up the pyramid. The High Court sits at a higher level than the county courts and handles the most complex and high-value civil claims. These can include things like major contract disputes, serious personal injury claims, or complex commercial litigation. The Crown Court, on the other hand, deals primarily with criminal cases, not civil ones. The Court of Session and Sheriff Court are part of the Scottish legal system, so they wouldn't be relevant to cases in England and Wales. So, when you think about the gravest, most serious civil cases, they end up in the High Court.
