The Union Jack, officially known as the Union Flag, is a fascinating symbol of the United Kingdom's history. It's a combination of three older flags: the St. George's Cross, representing England; the St. Andrew's Cross, representing Scotland; and the St. Patrick's Cross, representing Ireland. Now, here's the key point: Wales isn't directly represented in the Union Jack. This is because when the first version of the Union Flag was created in 1606, Wales was already united with England. The St. George's Cross was seen to represent both countries at that time. So, while Wales is undoubtedly a vital part of the UK, its dragon doesn't appear on the Union Jack. It's a common misconception that all four nations are individually represented, but the historical context explains why Wales is included under the English flag in this instance.
