The Reformation, a pivotal movement in European history during the 16th century, was all about religious reform and challenging the authority of the Pope and the Catholic Church. Think of it as a religious revolution! Before this, the Catholic Church was the dominant religious power in Europe. However, reformers like Martin Luther and John Calvin questioned some of its practices and teachings. A key aspect of this movement was the idea that individuals should be able to interpret the Bible for themselves, rather than relying solely on the Church's interpretation. This led to the rise of Protestantism, a branch of Christianity separate from Catholicism. Because Protestants had different beliefs and interpretations, they naturally established their own churches, separate from the existing Catholic ones. These new churches became centers for Protestant worship and teaching, marking a significant shift in the religious landscape of Europe and, eventually, the UK. So, the statement is true.
