Valentine's Day, celebrated on February 14th, has evolved into a cultural tradition centered around expressing affection. Its origins are somewhat murky, linked to several St. Valentines from Roman times, but the association with romantic love began to solidify in the Middle Ages. By the 18th century, exchanging handmade cards and small tokens of affection became common in Britain. This tradition has continued to the present day, with commercially produced cards and gifts now widely available. What makes Valentine's Day unique is the element of anonymity. While many people exchange cards and gifts with their partners or loved ones, it's also customary for individuals to send cards to "secret admirers" â€“ people they admire from afar but haven't necessarily declared their feelings to. This playful aspect of the holiday, with its air of mystery and potential romance, is a well-established part of British culture. So, the idea of sending anonymous cards is definitely part of the Valentine's Day tradition.
