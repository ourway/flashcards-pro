The Palace of Westminster, home to the UK Parliament, operates on the principle of transparency and public access. While being on the electoral register is crucial for voting and participating in elections, it doesn't dictate who can observe parliamentary proceedings. The public galleries in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords are open to anyone who wishes to listen to debates, subject to security checks and space availability. This tradition of open access dates back centuries and is a cornerstone of British democracy, allowing citizens to witness the legislative process firsthand. Think of it as a public forum where laws are debated and decisions are made, and you don't need a special pass beyond the standard security checks to observe. So, while registering to vote is vital for a healthy democracy, listening to debates is a right afforded to everyone, regardless of their electoral status.
