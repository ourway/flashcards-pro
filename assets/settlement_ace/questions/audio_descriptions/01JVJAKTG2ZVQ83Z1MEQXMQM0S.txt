Okay, let's talk about the legal age for buying tobacco in the UK. The key thing to remember here is that the age is 18. This wasn't always the case, though. For a long time, the legal age was actually 16. However, in 2007, the law changed, raising the age to 18 in England, Wales, and Scotland. Northern Ireland followed suit a bit later. This change was driven by public health concerns and a desire to reduce smoking rates, particularly among young people. The government wanted to align the age for purchasing tobacco with other adult responsibilities, like buying alcohol or voting, which are also set at 18. So, while 16 might seem like a plausible answer because it used to be the law, it's crucial to know that the current legal age for buying tobacco in the UK is 18. Thinking of it alongside drinking and voting ages can help you remember it.
