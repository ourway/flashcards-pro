The English Civil War, a tumultuous period in British history during the 17th century, was essentially a series of conflicts fought between the Royalists, who supported King Charles I, and the Parliamentarians, also known as Roundheads, who wanted more power for Parliament. This struggle for power led to significant battles across the country. Marston Moor, fought in 1644 near York, was a decisive victory for the Parliamentarians, marking a turning point in the war in the north of England. Naseby, which took place in 1645 in Northamptonshire, was another crucial battle where the Parliamentarian New Model Army decisively defeated the Royalist forces. These two battles, Marston Moor and Naseby, are particularly significant because they represent key moments where the Parliamentarians gained a strategic advantage, ultimately leading to their victory and the execution of Charles I. Agincourt, on the other hand, was a famous battle during the Hundred Years' War in 1415, long before the English Civil War. Bannockburn was a major Scottish victory against the English in 1314, during the Wars of Scottish Independence, also predating the Civil War by centuries.
