Okay, here's an explanation for the question about banknotes in Northern Ireland and Scotland:

Think of banknotes in the UK as being a bit more flexible than you might initially assume. While the Bank of England issues banknotes that are legal tender throughout the UK, some banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland also have the right to issue their own banknotes. This is a historical practice that dates back to the 19th century. These banknotes are technically promissory notes, meaning the issuing bank promises to pay the bearer the value of the note. While they aren't strictly legal tender everywhere in the UK (meaning a shopkeeper in London isn't legally obligated to accept them), they are generally accepted as currency throughout the UK, and banks will exchange them for Bank of England notes. So, the statement that Northern Ireland and Scotland issue their own banknotes is indeed true. It's a unique feature of the UK banking system, reflecting its historical development and regional variations. It's easy to assume that only the Bank of England issues notes, but this regional variation is an important part of the UK's financial landscape.
