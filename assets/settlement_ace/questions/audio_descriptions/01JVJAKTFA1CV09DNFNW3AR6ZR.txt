Bonfire Night, also known as Guy Fawkes Night, is celebrated on November 5th because it commemorates the failure of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605. A group of Catholics, including Guy Fawkes, plotted to blow up the Houses of Parliament and kill King James I. The plot was discovered on November 5th, and Fawkes was arrested. The day has been marked ever since with bonfires and fireworks, originally to celebrate the safety of the King and the failure of the plot. While February, May, and August are all months with their own celebrations, none are associated with this specific historical event. So, remembering the Gunpowder Plot and its discovery on November 5th is key to answering this question correctly. It's a unique British tradition tied directly to a specific date in history.
