Henry VIII's reign in the 16th century is one of the most pivotal in English history, largely because of his marital escapades and their profound religious consequences. The Catholic Church at the time did not allow divorce, but Henry was desperate to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, in order to marry Anne Boleyn and hopefully produce a male heir. When the Pope refused to grant him an annulment, Henry took matters into his own hands. In 1534, he declared himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England, effectively separating from the Roman Catholic Church. This act, known as the Act of Supremacy, allowed him to grant himself a divorce and remarry. He went on to marry six times in total, a fact that has made him one of the most well-known monarchs in English history. So, the statement is true because Henry VIII's desire for multiple marriages directly led to his break with the Catholic Church and the establishment of the Church of England.
