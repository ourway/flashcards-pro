Okay, let's break down why immigration and defence are beyond the Northern Ireland Assembly's authority. Think about it this way: the UK operates under a system called devolution, where certain powers are delegated from the central government in Westminster to regional bodies like the Northern Ireland Assembly. However, some matters are considered inherently national and remain the sole responsibility of the UK government. Immigration policy, including border control and visa regulations, is one of these. It needs to be consistent across the entire UK to ensure effective border management and international relations. Similarly, defence, encompassing the armed forces and national security, is a core function of a sovereign state. Allowing regional assemblies to control these areas could lead to conflicting policies and undermine the UK's overall security and international standing. While the Northern Ireland Assembly has significant power over areas like education and agriculture, which directly impact the daily lives of its citizens, immigration and defence are reserved powers, ensuring a unified approach across the United Kingdom.
