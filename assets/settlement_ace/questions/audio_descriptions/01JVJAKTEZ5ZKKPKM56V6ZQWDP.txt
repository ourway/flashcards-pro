Haggis is undeniably the most traditionally Scottish food. Its roots go way back, with some historians tracing similar dishes to ancient Rome, but Scotland truly made it their own. What exactly is it? Well, it's a savoury pudding containing sheep's pluck – that's the heart, liver, and lungs – minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and stock, all encased in the animal's stomach. Sounds unusual, right? But it's a national dish! It's often served with "neeps and tatties" (mashed turnips and potatoes) and a dram of whisky. While roast beef is very British, it's more commonly associated with England, especially Sunday roasts. Fish and chips are popular throughout the UK, but not uniquely Scottish. Ulster fry is specific to Northern Ireland, and Welsh cakes, as the name suggests, are from Wales. So, while those other dishes are part of the broader UK culinary landscape, haggis is the one that screams "Scotland!"
