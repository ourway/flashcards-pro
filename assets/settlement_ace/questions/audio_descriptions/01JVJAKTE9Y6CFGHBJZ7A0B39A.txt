St. George's Day, celebrated on April 23rd, is England's national day, although it isn't a public holiday like St. Andrew's Day in Scotland or St. Patrick's Day in Northern Ireland. St. George became the patron saint of England in the 14th century. He's a figure shrouded in legend, most famously known for slaying a dragon, a tale that symbolizes good triumphing over evil. While the exact historical origins of St. George are debated, his image and story were embraced during the medieval period, particularly by soldiers during the Crusades. The date, April 23rd, is traditionally associated with his death. So, while you might be tempted to think of other dates, especially around significant seasonal changes, remember that England specifically honors St. George, their patron saint, on the 23rd of April each year.
