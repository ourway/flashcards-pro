When you need to prove who you are, official organizations need to be sure you are really you. That's why they ask for specific documents. Think about it: what makes a document official? Usually, it's something issued by a recognized authority, like the government, a bank, or a utility company. These documents link your name and address to an official record, making them reliable. A recent gas bill or a bank statement works because these companies verify your identity before sending you statements. A document from the Home Office, the government department dealing with immigration, is obviously a valid form of ID. However, a letter from a friend, while perhaps heartfelt, doesn't carry any official weight. Anyone could write a letter saying they know you, so it doesn't provide the necessary verification that official bodies require. It lacks that crucial link to a trusted, independent source.
