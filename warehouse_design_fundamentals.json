    "question": "What is the Kimball approach to Data Warehousing?",
    "answer": "Kimball promotes a bottom-up approach where data marts are built using Star or Snowflake schemas and later integrated into a data warehouse.\n\n### What are Data Marts?\nData marts are specialized databases that store domain-specific data optimized for analysis.
