    "question": "What is the Kimball approach to Data Warehousing?",
    "answer": "Kimball promotes a bottom-up approach where data marts are built using Star or Snowflake schemas and later integrated into a data warehouse.",
    "reference": "https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/",
    "case_study": "Netflix uses Kimball’s Dimensional Modeling to optimize customer viewing data for fast analytics, improving personalized recommendations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Inmon approach to Data Warehousing?",
    "answer": "Inmon promotes a top-down approach where a normalized enterprise data warehouse (EDW) is created first, and then data marts are built for specific business functions.",
    "reference": "https://www.inmon.com/",
    "case_study": "Bank of America follows Inmon's approach for a centralized enterprise data warehouse that supports compliance and regulatory reporting."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a Star Schema in data modeling?",
    "answer": "A Star Schema consists of a central Fact table linked to multiple Dimension tables. It simplifies queries and improves performance by reducing joins.",
    "reference": "https://www.dataversity.net/star-schema-definition/",
    "case_study": "Walmart uses Star Schema to track sales data efficiently, enabling rapid aggregation of transaction details for BI reporting."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a Snowflake Schema, and how does it differ from Star Schema?",
    "answer": "A Snowflake Schema normalizes dimension tables by breaking them into sub-dimensions, reducing redundancy but increasing joins compared to a Star Schema.",
    "reference": "https://www.datawarehouse4u.info/Snowflake-Schema.html",
    "case_study": "Amazon uses Snowflake Schema to manage their product catalog efficiently, reducing storage duplication across millions of SKUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the drawbacks of normalization in Data Warehouses?",
    "answer": "Normalization increases joins, which can slow down query performance. Denormalized schemas like Star Schema are often preferred for analytical queries.",
    "reference": "https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/star-schema-in-data-warehouse/",
    "case_study": "Facebook originally used highly normalized schemas but transitioned to denormalized data warehouses for faster analytics."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a Fact Table in a Data Warehouse?",
    "answer": "A Fact Table stores business events (transactions) and contains foreign keys linking to Dimension Tables, along with numeric measures (e.g., sales amount, quantity).",
    "reference": "https://www.dataversity.net/fact-table-definition/",
    "case_study": "Uber’s ride transactions are stored in a Fact Table with dimensions for drivers, passengers, and ride duration to enable surge pricing analytics."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD)?",
    "answer": "A Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) manages historical changes in dimension data. \n- SCD Type 1: Overwrites old data.\n- SCD Type 2: Creates new rows for changes.\n- SCD Type 3: Stores a limited history using extra columns.",
    "reference": "https://www.sqlshack.com/slowly-changing-dimension-scd-types/",
    "case_study": "A global bank tracks customer address changes using SCD Type 2 to maintain historical records for fraud detection."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a Surrogate Key in Data Warehousing?",
    "answer": "A Surrogate Key is an artificial, system-generated key (usually an integer) used in place of a natural key to uniquely identify records in a table.",
    "reference": "https://www.dataversity.net/surrogate-key-definition/",
    "case_study": "A retail chain assigns surrogate keys to customers in its loyalty program, ensuring consistent tracking even if customer details change."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Data Vault Modeling, and how does it differ from Kimball and Inmon?",
    "answer": "Data Vault is a hybrid model that combines normalization (like Inmon) and dimensional modeling (like Kimball). It separates business keys (Hubs), relationships (Links), and attributes (Satellites) to support scalability and historical tracking.",
    "reference": "https://www.datavaultacademy.com/what-is-data-vault/",
    "case_study": "Airbnb uses Data Vault to integrate structured and semi-structured booking data across multiple regions while maintaining historical integrity."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the best practices for designing a Data Warehouse?",
    "answer": "- Clearly define business requirements\n- Use appropriate schema (Star/Snowflake)\n- Optimize queries with indexing and partitioning\n- Implement Slowly Changing Dimensions for historical tracking\n- Ensure security and compliance with access controls",
    "reference": "https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/",
    "case_study": "Tesla optimizes sensor data warehousing by partitioning time-series vehicle performance data, improving analytics for predictive maintenance."
